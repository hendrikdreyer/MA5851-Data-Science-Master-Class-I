I have a bit more respect for why websites like Twitter don&#x27;t change much.<p>On Indie Hackers in particular, one thing I&#x27;ve noticed is that people tend to be kind without much moderation. My leading hypothesis at this point is that almost everyone has skin in the game. You&#x27;re less likely to bash someone else&#x27;s project if you know you&#x27;ll be posting about your project soon, so norms have developed around being constructive and encouraging.<p>By contrast, HN has a norm around finding fault with whoever you&#x27;re responding to, which is great for informative debate and conversation -- I learn a lot here from reading so many different opinions on each issue.<p>[0] <a href=\"\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.indiehackers.com\"\" rel=\"\"nofollow\"\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.indiehackers.com</a>\"',\n",

My friend was an incredibly skilled programmer, probably one of the best programmers who built things people used or could use, that I knew at the time.<p>I was a competition programmer.<p>We were both learning HTML5 at the time, and we both took on the task in very different ways. I believe we were writing Nibbles (Snake) or something like it, as a learning exercise, each.<p>I learned the basics: arrays, function creation, etc, and then went really fast at building the whole program without testing it, connecting all the pieces together in ways that I assumed would work. In the programming competitions I took part in, 3 people shared one computer, all doing different problems at the same time, so most of us wrote our code on paper before we put it in to the computer.<p>After my whole code for snake was written or at least as much as I wanted to have for a prototype (it&#x27;s been many years since we did this, so I don&#x27;t remember a lot), I started trying to run it. It didn&#x27;t work, of course, or did messy things, and so I spent a bunch of time going through and fixing the bugs that were in my code.<p>My friend went a completely different approach. Of course I don&#x27;t remember specifics, but it was something like this:<p>* he got a pixel drawing in a canvas<p>* he got a pixel moving on the canvas<p>* he got apples appearing on a canvas<p>* he got a chain of pieces of the snake following<p>* he got collision working<p>Of course, this is probably not what actually happened; but, this is basically what I remember about how he coded. He was very slow, methodical, and had a step-by-step process of how the whole code would work.<p>In the end, I think he had his program working before I did and much better; but, if you looked at just the start, you might assume he&#x27;s not skilled.<p>--<p>Let&#x27;s fast forward to today and a different person.<p>I was talking directly to a senior engineer at my company the other day. Very skilled, very, very skilled. We were talking about how we do things. It came out that I design systems and draw pictures to get flow and layout down. I like to work on weird, pie-in-the-sky, robust systems that tend to take a drawing to figure out later, because they&#x27;re powerful and do powerful things; and, the goal of those systems tend to be to pre-emptively be ready for v-next and handle all of the requirements as cleanly as possible, and future requirements as cleanly as possible.<p>He greatly prefers to start hacking on a solution quickly and get something building and then work in the nuance and ugly later, refactoring whole sections over time to get a better and better solution.<p>When I remark on a dangerous test case or scenario area that I&#x27;m worried about when it comes to the upcoming solution, he&#x27;s always thought of that problem area ahead of time, too; but, from what he tells me about how he works, he starts hacking basically right away; and, I don&#x27;t think he does the crazy designs as his first version, either.<p>--<p>I&#x27;m not sure where I&#x27;m going with this; but, I think I want to say that this:<p>&gt;  I ran node in console after small changes and additions to print, test, debug.<p>is not a sufficient reason to think you&#x27;re not senior; but, this:<p>&gt; I didn’t have a mental model of the subtask<p>might be.

If the interview only cares about your thinking process, then they probably don&#x27;t care if you don&#x27;t write the code to get the substring you need exactly right, or they might not care if you get rounding wrong, or output formatting wrong, because that&#x27;s not the part of the problem you&#x27;re being asked to solve.<p>You get better at this by interviewing more and practicing asking questions.<p>--<p>You mention this:<p>&gt; The feedback was you can’t do this when compiling time is long and development will be slow<p>While this is true, for most of the work I do, I could write a small program on the side that tests the design I&#x27;m going for that compiles quickly and then inject that code into the larger code base and test the rigging.

Here&#x27;s a few examples:<p>If the business goal is to give better estimates for fulfilling custom features faster, then testing would be the first in the list. Not even the release process. Tests lessens cognitive load for developers when they&#x27;re asked &quot;how long can we make this feature?&quot;. They&#x27;ll have an idea that it&#x27;ll probably break a bunch of services, etc. a.) If you&#x27;re in leadership, ask for tests when people make a PR. b.) If you&#x27;re not in leadership, look for the smallest part of the monolith. Write 1 integration test, add a CI integration, put it in a PR. Co-workers would probably like that.<p>If the business goal is to give better SLA&#x27;s (turn around time for addressing breaking bugs, scaling better), then the release process would come first.<p>Regarding technical debt: One way to address technical debt is to slowly address it by folding in the effort of cleaning and refactoring inside a feature request. ex: making a new form about 2FA takes 3 days, but you can say 7 and explain that we&#x27;ll setup a CI test build, then hit and address some debt regarding User Authentication along the way.<p>It&#x27;ll introduce as a &quot;Clean As You Go&quot; culture in the legacy engineering team, which will pay off in the long-run instead of having a huge amount of time just dedicated to addressing technical debt.<p>The danger of separating &quot;address technical debt&quot; as a separate effort is it sometimes results into some unnecessary abstractions and over-refactoring: i.e. trying to make certain things too generic, bordering on building a framework.<p>But then again, if the business goal was to make a framework for a business goal (maybe something the bizdev can sell), then it can definitely be made as a separate effort.

Whenever a file is modified, find the previously opened stream and read. Every time I read, I push it onto an async Queue which will be consumed by another async task. That would emulate something similar to go channels. Multiple IO tasks, that sounds like a job for async&#x2F;await. This was my mental model before I coded a single line.<p>After a few dozen minutes and a single confusing error (I forgot to pass the asyncio loop into the queue and the sleep functions) it was done. I even made it so that it would output the newly appended logs to the stdin of another process or another file.

The hard part was understanding the problem model enough to know what code to type.<p>That being said, executing the code while typing it is critical. You cannot build a mental model of all edge cases. At best, your personal discipline will allow you have habits around preventing and catching edge cases. But you won&#x27;t find enough edge cases just by thinking about the code to type. You do have to discover them by running the code, and the sooner you discover them, the faster you will be at producing high quality code.<p>As far as how much time I spend building a mental model vs coding... It&#x27;s at least half mental model time. If I happen to predict enough edge cases, then it might be 90% of the time. But the critical part is that I&#x27;m not done until I&#x27;ve exhausted the edge cases I can imagine. If I discover sufficiently big edge cases that brick my code, it&#x27;s time to step away from the computer and fix my broken mental model.<p>Note: tests are a way to do this, but so is white box poking and prodding at your program in debug mode.',\n",
       " 'I manage a team that directly uses ML to create software services that our customers pay money to use. This is relatively rare. Most ML applications are internal - your customer is your own company. In this case, you should think of yourself as an in-house ML consultancy for your company. You need to reliably create value for the company, and be able to measure it.<p>In my opinion, there are three business &quot;tiers&quot; of ML.<p>1. Process automation. You&#x27;re turning a defined business process currently done by a human into something automated, with some custom rule logic, of which some of it may be via ML-trained models. The easiest, because the criteria are well-defined and everyone knows what success looks like.<p>2. Data Mining&#x2F;Analysis&#x2F;Insight. Your company sits on some unexploited set of data, and you want to generate useful business insight from it. ML models can help make sense of it. This takes the traditional business intelligence function to the next level. Harder, because you may need to educate the company on what ML offers. They may not even realize what types of new questions ML can answer.<p>3. Customer-facing automated-decision services. This is the most demanding application from a business perspective, but not necessarily from a technical perspective. The standards for quality, stability, accuracy, should be much, much higher. If it&#x27;s customer-facing, it can&#x27;t mess up, or people will stop trusting it. The customer may be internal or external.',\n",

The waterfall model dictates planning (almost) everything ahead, while the iterative model says plan sufficiently far ahead, then start coding, then take a break and re-evaluate, do some more planning, do some more coding, rinse, repeat. I certainly prefer an iterative model, and building prototypes, as you do. But even then, I&#x27;d say professional development work is 90% planning ahead, and only 10% actual coding.

It is about understanding the drivers and history that got each team to where they are, picking apart which of those drivers is still relevant, and looking for shared pain points between teams that are now open to change due to changes in the business since things were set up.<p>Because of this, I&#x27;d focus less on the technical side, and more on communications and business, as those are the rabbit holes you&#x27;ll need to go down to build consensus from multiple teams to mutually move to a better place.',\n",

There are a few solutions available; I recommend Jaeger.<p>You do need to instrument your applications to emit traces, but don&#x27;t go overboard.  Make sure everything can extract the trace ID from headers &#x2F; metadata and that requests they generate include the trace ID.  Most languages have plugins for their HTTP &#x2F; gRPC server and client libraries to do this automatically.<p>You will want your edge proxy to start the trace for you; this is very easy with Envoy and ... possible ... with nginx and the opentracing plugins.<p>I use structured logs (zap specifically), so I wrote an adaptor that accepts a context.Context for a given request, extracts the trace ID from that (and x-b3-sampled), and logs it with every line.  This means that when I&#x27;m looking at logs, I can easily cut-n-paste the ID into Jaeger to look at the entire request, or if I&#x27;m looking at a trace, type the ID into Kibana and see every log line associated with the request.  (The truly motivated engineer would modify the Jaeger UI to pull logs along with spans since they&#x27;re both stored in ES.

It took me days to figure out how to make fluentd parse zap&#x27;s output properly.

       " '\"Original Skype for Web developer here. I was part of the launch team who built the first version for this product in 2014[1]. Back then we supported Chrome, IE 9+, Safari and Firefox. Already we had internal debates to support Opera, but the decision was to focus on the largest browsers.<p>For each browser, we had to add support in our standalone plugin, that was (and still is) required to install for audio&#x2F;video calls. There was a small maintenance cost per browser, which was a bigger one whenever changes to the plug-in were made.<p>I left Skype&#x2F;Microsoft a long time ago and Microsoft announced in March they will drop support for Firefox[2]. I can only speculate, but it’s likely due to not wanting to pay the maintenance cost of this product on an ongoing basis.<p><i>Not directly related story from building Skype for Web:</i> a big internal battle those days was us vs the Edge team. We wanted Edge to ship the Skype plugin as default, making calls seamless for Edge users, not needing to install a plugin (we saw large drops in adoption due to this plugin). Chrome already did exactly this with Hangouts back in the day and we saw it as them eating our lunch.<p>This was at the time of Steve Balmer’s Microsoft, where collaboration between different orgs was difficult and facing strong political headwind. We got nowhere with the Edge team, who wanted no dependencies and prioritised performance above anything like this - and also wanted to hit their own KPIs, which had nothing to do with Skype users preferring to use Edge.<p>We reasoned, pleaded, argued, steamed, shouted names and even used the &quot;C&quot; argument (&quot;but... but... but... even Chrome does it!&quot;). No avail. So a separate plugin install it was, giving people zero incentive to use a Microsoft browser for a Microsoft product. The Edge team were pleased they did not have to cater for another dependency and their roadmap remained unchanged. We were frustrated and had little doubt which brodwser will keep gaining market share - being certain it will not be IE&#x2F;Edge.<p><i>Other not directly related story</i>: a few years ago I wrote in detail my take on why Skype failed, here on HN.

While getting started, here are a few high-level principles I found useful to adhere that will make your life easier later:<p>Think of a multi-stage pipeline for getting raw data from your transactional&#x2F;interaction systems and extracting insights and intelligence out of them.<p>Stage-1: Ingestion – Keep this simple. Don&#x27;t mess this up. Its a serious headache if you do.<p>1. Generate a request-id or message-id at the genesis of the request and propagate it throughout your call graph from client to servers (across any number of api call graph hops).<p>2. At each node in the call graph, emit whatever logs you want to emit, include this id.<p>3. Use whatever format you find natural and easy to use in each tech stack environment. Key is to make the logging instrumentation very natural and normal to each codebase such that the instrumentation does not get accidentally broken while adding new features.<p>4. Build a plumbing layer (agnostic of what is being logged) that can locally buffer these log messages, periodically compress and package them with added sequence and integrity verification mechanisms, and reliability transmit them to a central warehouse. Use this across all your server-side nodes. Build a similar one for each of your client side platforms.<p>5. At the central warehouse, immediately persist these log packages durably and then only respond to client indicating it is safe to purge those packages on their local nodes.<p>Stage-2: Use-case driven ETLs.<p>6. Come up with use-cases to consume this data. Define data tables (facts and dimensions) needed to support these consumption use case.<p>7. Build a high-performance stream processing system that can process the raw log packages for doing ETL (extract, transform and load) on the raw data in different formats to the defined consumable data tables.<p>Stage-3: Actual Use-case data applications.<p>Run your analytics and machine learning systems on top of these stable consumable data formats.<p>Keep the stages separate and decoupled in code and systems. Don&#x27;t do end-to-end optimizations and break the boundaries. Recognize that the actors&#x2F;stakeholders involved in each stage are different.

       " '\"This is something that I&#x27;ve struggled with myself so I can only give you advice as I&#x27;ve learned it from my perspective.<p>Math is a big field so you have to understand what parts you&#x27;re really interested in and how you want information to be presented so that you&#x27;ll learn it. For example, I&#x27;m interested in computation aspects of mathematics (information theory, computation group theory, abstract algebra, analysis, etc.) and I always prefer a &quot;computer programmers&quot; intuition in how to learn these subjects. That is, understanding how to &#x27;program it&#x27;, whatever that means for the different subjects I&#x27;m interested in.<p>Here is a small list of intuition I&#x27;ve learned about finding good resources:<p>* Books, and sometimes textbooks, are still a valuable resource. It&#x27;s still the case that having a book on a subject that has curated content is better than the random Wikipedia articles or blog posts on the subject. Use Wikipedia, obviously, and look at blog posts, but I search for books in the subject area, especially if it&#x27;s a field I&#x27;m not familiar with.<p>* When looking for books, prefer books that have &quot;elementary&quot; in the title, as in &quot;elementary introduction&quot;. The more &quot;advanced&quot; books are talking about the bounds of research in the area, often fussing over esoteric issues whereas the &quot;elementary&quot; books give the foundation of knowledge in that area.<p>* Ideally for me, books would have &quot;fundamental algorithms&quot; somewhere in the title, as these books usually are exactly what I need to understand a field.<p>* When reading, ideally I make sure to do the exercises or run through the proofs myself. Mathematics is not a spectator sport and a large part of it is &quot;learn by doing&quot;. Finding good resources so those exercises are meaningful is hard but they still need to be done.<p>* I often check MathOverflow, MathUndeflow, Physics.Stackexchange, CStheory.Stackexchange and other accompanying sites. There are a surprising number of good answers to questions of the form &quot;what is the motivation behind...&quot;. As the subjects get more esoteric, these questions become more infrequent these resources are still invaluable. Asking questions on these sites is also an option and usually helpful.<p>* In the past I&#x27;ve watched more in depth lectures from mathematicians, either from conferences or from things like OpenCourseWare. There&#x27;s a lot of &#x27;folklore&#x27; wisdom that&#x27;s embedded with people that sometimes comes out when viewing actual researchers talk about their research that wouldn&#x27;t otherwise be apparent or emphasized in papers.<p>* I sometimes visit blogs from mathematicians or about mathematicians.<p>When I was younger in college, I was fortunate to have a social group of friends who were graduate students and TAs that had an appetite for discovery and teaching. There was a lot of folklore and intuition that was taught which would have been difficult to find otherwise. I think many graduate students in mathematics essentially use their exposure to their advisor, other teachers and other students to build that intuition.<p>I should also mention that there isn&#x27;t &quot;one way&quot; to learn about these subjects. I take a computational perspective because that&#x27;s my preference but I&#x27;m fully aware that not everyone thinks that way. Every person has their own perspective on what&#x27;s fundamental and how they learn and build intuition even if they can be grouped in to rough categorizations (though I&#x27;d be hard pressed to quantify those categorizations). I&#x27;ve found the way I learn and optimize for it and I unfortunately have a hard time when information isn&#x27;t presented in the way I need it to be, at least initially while I&#x27;m building intuition and learning a subject for the first time.<p>I can&#x27;t find the quote now but there was a mathematician that was talking about Erdos and how Erdos didn&#x27;t have deep knowledge or at least didn&#x27;t use &quot;higher mathematics&quot; like Lie theory or other higher abstractions. Yet Erdos was prolific in his sense with his &quot;elementary&quot; methods, probably because he understood his tools and the problems deeply. As an analogy, it&#x27;d be like someone who knows assembly well trying to analyze a Haskell script. The Haskell programmer might have intuition from the constructs of that language but someone who knows assembly well understands that each of the abstractions in Haskell must eventually boil down to assembly instructions and can understand it from that perspective.<p>I also try to employ the &quot;20% effort for 80% gain&quot; rule. There are usually some basic concepts so learning them as fast as possible is the goal. This also allows for maximum gain for effort spent as if the field is interesting, I can dive deeper or move onto another if it&#x27;s not.<p>I try to avoid resources that are &quot;TED talk&quot; like, press releases, or other &quot;feel good&quot; resources, like 3Brown1Blue. These are great for being inspired by mathematics (which is important!) but are usually devoid of content. Resources like 3Brown1Blue I find especially pernicious as they couch deep understanding by regurgitating facts without providing any fundamental insight.<p>I tend to stay away from Springer books as they&#x27;re usually dense. They might be good for reference but for initial learning I&#x27;ve found them to be pretty bad.<p>People often say &quot;read the original papers&quot; but I found this to be horrible advice as the original papers often are a very rough &#x27;proto&#x27; model of the ideas presented and don&#x27;t benefit from work that&#x27;s been done to simplify and extract the important parts of the theory without the cruft. Often times, mathematicians have their own pet notation which further get in the way of understanding.

These are because of various factors. The main factors are we allow the plant to grow suitably thereby maximizing required production.<p>For example in a capsicum polyhouse, there are nets which help the plant to climb, and almost everything is supplied to the plant on more than required basis.<p>The capsicum plant is allowed minimal leaves so that max nutrition is allowed for the capsicum alone and not for the plant leaves etc. You can think of it it like a kid with a silver spoon, these plants get everything in return for capsisum and  capsicum alone. ( who cares abt capsicum leaves BTW )<p>Secondly The price of capsicum is not determined by the buyer nor the producer , its determined by some trader who is totally unknown. This unknown person gets to decide on the price.<p>You the end customer nor the farmer has any say in determining the price. This is especially difficult when the output is perishable. The farmer has to sell it at whatever the price which is offered or else his produce will rot. When you grow a bumper crop its all the more difficult to find that many no of traders , transport etc. Selling 1 Ton itself is difficult enough, imagine the complexity when you have 10 tons from the same farm. You would need more resources to manage everything. The trader will never offer the same rate as he would have offered for 1 ton since he knows very well that you would never be able to sell 10 tons.<p>No country has the ways and means to distribute all the produce effectively across to its citizens.<p>The problems with polyhouses compound when other methods are introduced ( think hydrophonics,aerophonics,vertical farming etc), There is no economics involved in these.<p>Unless you do it as a passion. its never profitable to grow brocolli or lettuice in hydrophonics. The trader will never give you the right price if you have an huge quantity.<p>Its very easy to say brocolli sells for $X and we can do this and that and reduce it by $y in reality no one can control every aspect of the food chain.<p>Isreal does it becuase of its limited land availabilty , not with the case of India ,china and USA.<p>I am not sure if I had explained the whole correctly but Hydroponics + etc  is only a hobby never commercially viable.',\n",

       " 'A lot of intuition in math is from geometry.  High school plane geometry is a good start, but high school solid geometry, where get good tools and intuition for seeing things in 3D instead of just the 2D of plane geometry, is quite a bit better.<p>Another part of intuition is from Max Zorn (from Zorn&#x27;s lemma statement of the axiom of choice):<p>&quot;Be wise, generalize.&quot;<p>E.g., for the set of real numbers R and a positive integer n, a lot that goes on in the n-dimensional vector space R^n is a <i>generalization</i> of what can see in 3D, e.g., from solid geometry.<p>E.g., in both cases, a biggie is a perpendicular (<i>orthogonal</i>) projection and, again, the Pythagorean theorem.  E.g., regression in statistics is a perpendicular projection.<p>Perpendicular (orthogonality) is a biggie and is a major part of, say, Fourier series.  I.e., each of the sine&#x2F;cosine waves used is an orthogonal axis, and to find the corresponding Fourier series coefficient just project onto that axis.  The projection is an integral of a product, and that is commonly an <i>inner product</i> which close to just a cosine of an angle as in plane and solid geometry and a perpendicular projection and close to correlation in statistics, etc.<p>E.g., a huge fraction of applied math is from <i>analysis</i> in pure math, and from G. F. Simmons the two pillars of analysis are &quot;continuity and linearity&quot;.  Linearity generalizes enormously:  The quantum mechanics <i>super position</i> is essentially linearity.  Under meager assumptions, differentiation and integration in calculus are linear <i>operators</i>.  In probability theory, expectation is a linear operator.  The wave equation is a linear partial differential equation.  Linear programming works on linear equations.    Of course, in <i>linear</i> algebra, matrix multiplication is a linear operator. When something is not linear, it may be <i>locally</i> linear which can be enough to get useful results.<p>For more, a good lesson is to <i>approximate</i>:  Commonly we can&#x27;t get just what we want in just one step but can <i>iterate</i> and <i>approximate</i> as closely as we please.  So, can use simple things, sine waves, polynomials, continuous functions, and more, as means of approximation.  Such approximation gets us close to more in <i>continuity</i> and, in particular, <i>completeness</i> -- the real numbers are <i>complete</i> and the rational numbers are not but via iteration can approximate the reals as closely as we please.  Then this generalizes:  The big point about Hilbert space (as mathematicians but not always physicists define it) is completeness.  A joke, partly correct, is that &quot;calculus is the elementary consequences of the completeness property of the real number system&quot;.  E.g., the integral in calculus (and its better version in measure theory) is defined in terms of an iterative approximation.  So, if you are good with sine waves, polynomials, continuous functions, wavelets, and more, then you can iterate and approximate a lot, in many cases, everything there is in that case.',\n",
       " 'Short-haul and medium-haul and long-haul conventional take-off electric aircraft.<p>There&#x27;s a lot of work on VTOL electric aircraft and hybrid aircraft.

On the higher end, there&#x27;s a lot of work on enabling lithium-air or lithium-sulfur or solid state lithium or metal electrode lithium ion batteries. However, there&#x27;s not a lot of work on combining extremely high efficiency airframes (i.e. glider-like) with extremely high performance batteries (and high battery mass fraction, i.e. 60%, not 25%). Often one or the other is the focus, but a combination is essential to enable decent range (1000km) with existing batteries and long-haul range (at 4000-10,000km) with advanced chemistries (lithium air).<p>Another issue is low capital cost hydrogen production. There has been a lot of work on reducing the cost-per-watt of solar and wind power and fuel cells, but progress on cost-per-watt on hydrogen production (i.e. electrolysis) has been lacking. That means it&#x27;s not financially viable to produce hydrogen from excess intermittent renewable energy, in spite of the clear potential (if the cost-per-watt of your electrolysis equipment is much higher than the cost-per-watt of wind or solar, you need to run near constantly to make your capital investment make sense... hydrogen doesn&#x27;t work as a flexible demand source if the capital cost is so high the plant has to run all the time).<p>Microbiome modification to reduce methane emissions from ruminants (cows and sheep and goats).<p>Liquid hydrogen powered container ships or long-haul aircraft (and a method of dealing with the water emissions so as not to release water vapor at high altitudes).<p>High efficiency deep cryogenic liquefaction of hydrogen.<p>Battery-electric long haul locomotives (perhaps with intermittent charging via catenary).<p>Extremely cheap Level 1 or 2 electric charging outlets.
