2019-09-03,"&quot;why are technical interviews one-way&quot;
Because you should sell yourself. Sometimes people at company&#x27;s side are polite, sometimes they are full of crap. If you don&#x27;t like an interview that company is not for you, basically. Just continue to search or set up your own company :)"

2019-09-02,"1) Yes. And Companies might also pay for training.
2) Actually, good forums for this are lacking. WiserState is good step in this direction
3) Yes. First time managers need all the help they can get. 
4) Consider if it should be video based or should be a giant tree based questionnaire? Text is faster to read. Much much faster to read. I can read at my own pace, the areas that I do not like. Understanding what I would do in various scenarios will help me understand what I should do in this situation.  Write blogs to other resources on the topic to increase your street cred.
5) This is not interactive video. This is pre recorded videos with some input from users."
2019-09-02,what is the purpose of this question?
2019-09-02,"I really didn&#x27;t expect to get this many passionate opinions on the matter.<p>It took me some time to... build up the courage to read through all of your answers, and you have been of tremendous help. I&#x27;ve learned quite a lot. Thank you very much! I deeply appreciate it!<p>I&#x27;ll steer clear of self-hosted ELK, for now, mostly because being the only backend, I can&#x27;t really take the risk of holding the whole team back while getting it up and running or maintaining it.<p>I&#x27;ll look into Splunk, Sumo Logic, Sentry &amp; a few others, while keeping in mind the more general guidelines that were laid down here.<p>Also, thank you for the terminology! It&#x27;s much easier to find the proper resources know that I know what to look for!<p>Edit: I&#x27;ll also take some time to answer to the different comments; but it really felt rude of me to be procrastinating while you all had taken the time to properly answer"

2019-09-01,I don&#x27;t see how it&#x27;s possible to code without a mental model. It&#x27;s like drawing something without &quot;seeing&quot; it.<p>That sounds really really hard.
2019-09-01,"I would agree with the sentiment about Forums. I owe a lot of my younger development years to groups of people on niche forums. They can harbor a lot of negativity sometime, but I found that the real toxic ones tended to destroy themselves and because they’re all mutually exclusive to their focuses, it was a pretty natural evolution of “community” if the forum survived for long periods of time.<p>I think that reddit has a foothold with subreddits, but they’re just not the same. As of now, I’m searching for decent aviation forum communities to explore as it’s my new learning focus.<p>Never heard of lobster, looks neat. If it doesn’t bother you, I’d love an invite to that so I can check it out.<p>Overall, I think a singular place where all of humanity “socializes” isn’t realistic. We need our corners and groups that belong to us individually."
2019-09-01,"I regard engineering as a daemon that will magically give me anything, from a nice cuppa tea to a nuclear holocaust.<p>The daemon has a strong preference for nuclear holocaust.<p>The trick is to give it explicitly, concisely and precisely supply all the information it needs, out of the infinity of possibilities, to make a nice cuppa tea (preferably without creating a toxic waste problem).<p>I tend to construct my code.<p>I have the signatures of the functions at the boundary of the code visible, and then I create the data structures to hold the information required.<p>Then I wired the boundaries to the data model and uncover... holes. Gaps.<p>So I assume then my daemon will magically grant me all I need to plug that gap, so long as I tell it precisely what the gap is... and then test that what I have so far is &quot;tea-like&quot; and not emitting gamma rays.<p>And then turn myself into the daemon to create those parts I needed to plug the gaps.<p>So what is my mental model? A daemon with a preference for nuclear holocaust."

2019-09-01,"I have wasted a lot of time trying to develop people that are content. I tried to invest in them because I wasn&#x27;t where I wanted to be and was unhappy with myself so I thought everyone was unhappy. I&#x27;ve realized that many people in my immediate network don&#x27;t know what they&#x27;re missing because they don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s possible. So instead of focusing on my own race, I was lugging dead weight across the finish line while people were stopping to ties their shoes or drinking water. I was moving about unsatisfied until I found startup school and see that I could bumble around in the dark until I find success. I wasted a lot of time preparing for success and researching and planning. I wanted to &quot;get it right&quot; but I had no barometer to measure success."

2019-08-31,"I think everyone has to have _some_ kind of &quot;mental model&quot; otherwise you wouldn&#x27;t be able to code anything except random keystrokes.<p>But next time just write some comments outlining what the function is supposed to do.<p>Also take whatever rationalization people give for what they do with a grain of salt.  There are lots of reasons they might have picked someone else -- maybe there was a cheaper hire, or a prettier one, or you had bad breathe that day.<p>But comments with an outline before you start typing real code should satisfy most people&#x27;s idea of having a mental model.<p>If you want to pass a FAANG interview with algorithmic&#x2F;puzzle questions then that&#x27;s totally different than pair programming and you will probably want to get a book specifically related to that or something.  Like a book titled &quot;Cracking the Code Interview&quot; or something."

2019-08-31,"If you’re saying you write code without knowing what you’re writing then yes you should have a mental model.<p>It’s a lot easier to build in your head than to write code. You might go through a dozen ways of doing something in your mind which would take an age to do in code.<p>Further, writing code to produce a mental model is limiting because every line you write naively commits you to fewer possibilities. You can be a lot more revolutionary in your head at no added cost and without throwing away hours of work."
2019-08-31,"The hardest part can often be generating your own source of positive feedback when you&#x27;re not getting it from the outside world or from even those around you.  It&#x27;s very easy to be positive when you&#x27;re drowning in investors and champagne, but not when you&#x27;ve been told &quot;no&quot; again or  when the setback you&#x27;ve encountered forces you to realize that you&#x27;ve lied to yourself and you knew all along with you should have been doing but you weren&#x27;t doing.<p>Imagining my goal as inevitable, as something that&#x27;s already happened helps me stay positive.  Anytime I encounter negativity that isn&#x27;t productive I consider it just a delay in a waste of my time.<p>Reappraisal is also a very powerful skill for remaining positive.  If you stop looking at your mistakes as setbacks or even mistakes and simply as &quot;cost paid for acquired wisdom&quot; you&#x27;ll realize that your value has still increased because you are now wiser."

2019-08-31,Over the past year I&#x27;ve been relying on mental&#x2F;written models especially when writing something new.

2019-08-31,"For largish problems, a general idea of the key structures and abstractions.. what&#x27;s desirable, what&#x27;s not... It becomes hard to think of how certain parts of the system mesh together... At that point, to avoid analysis paralysis, I write the scaffolding and some tests to see how the API feels... Most often, doing this clarifies stone assumptions that I was perhaps inadvertently making and leaves me with a path forward (after moving things around a bit)<p>So definitely iterative..<p>Whenever I&#x27;ve tried to design completely, it&#x27;s rarely worked well.

By removing the premium segment the entire group will have less value in the eyes of advertisers.<p>2. Google offers plenty of integrated services. They have only a few profitable when taken separately. Most of them are to support the few generating profit.<p>3. Would you pay separately for email, drive, search, ...? Probably not, so a flat price for all would make more sense. In this case you might be more valuable as part of a bigger pool of ad consumers. Remember you&#x27;re a &quot;premium&quot; user willing to pay for certain services that you can have for free. A gold mine for advertisers. I should keep your contact for when I&#x27;ll have some saas to sell.<p>4. If sold separately, each service will have at least one competitor specialized on a single product. Eg.

To be fast you definitely shouldn&#x27;t compile during a testable part. It also messes with your working memory.

The only limitation on prototyping is that it&#x27;s difficult to communicate what is being accomplished in the middle of the process, because you&#x27;ll make something that looks negligent or incomplete - it isn&#x27;t trying to answer all the concerns yet(that&#x27;s what you do in production code)."

Your work should always be deletable (you should keep version control somewhere non local) and your peers should always be able to see your code (asking or not, If it is in a company computer, everyone in the company has access to it). We also incentivize presentation on new technology or topics that emerged from the projects and usually people pitch each other their projects for new contributors. Projects considered products (that the programmer has started expecting profits at some point) should consider our non compete policy: if the product is in the same field as one of our products, our company has the right to be the first investor, with a minimum of 5% and cap of 15%. The valuation process is a bit dense to explain here, but several ex coworker are now partners with their own companies. The system works well but we have to watch out for talent retention.

2019-08-30,"About 7 years ago, when I was trying to monitor .Net apps, there weren&#x27;t that many alternatives available. The Elasticsearch-Logstash-Kibana stack had just gotten off the ground and I needed a way to send it structured logs and a large number of machines. Logary.tech was born to solve that problem.<p>Since then Logary has expanded with excellent support for sending both metrics and tracing data to a large number of targets. In production, I use this setup;<p>client browser -&gt; Logs &amp; metrics to Logary Rutta HTTP ingestion endpoint via Logary JS<p>nginx-ingress -&gt; Traces to Jaeger Agent via opentracing C++ client
nginx-ingress -&gt; Metrics to InfluxDB
nginx-ingress &lt;- Metrics via Prometheus scrape annotation<p>Our NextJS site and GraphQL server:
site -&gt; Traces to Jaeger Agent via opentracing
site -&gt; stdout logs via Logary JS (also get added as Logs in the Span of OpenTracing)
site &lt;- Metrics via Prometheus scrape annotation and prom-client<p>api -&gt; Traces to Jaeger Agent via Logary&#x27;s F# API
api -&gt; Metrics to InfluxDB via Logary&#x27;s F# API
api &lt;- Metrics via Prometheus scrape annotation and Logary.Prometheus
api -&gt; Events to Mixpanel via Logary.Targets.Mixpanel
api -&gt; Logs to Stackdriver via Logary.Targets.Stackdriver (hosted on GCP)<p>Also, Kubernetes ships logs via FluentD to Stackdriver in GCP, but they are not structured, and the remaining infrastructural services also send traces to Jaeger if they can.<p>Logary Rutta is a stand-alone log router, written in Hopac + F# (like Concurrent ML), and used by some of the largest Swedish software companies for thousands of logs and metrics per second. It&#x27;s capable of shipping to a large number of targets <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;logary&#x2F;logary&#x2F;tree&#x2F;master&#x2F;src&#x2F;targets"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;logary&#x2F;logary&#x2F;tree&#x2F;master&#x2F;src&#x2F;targets</a> Since it talks HTTP and UDP with a number of encodings (JSON, plain, binary), it&#x27;s easy to plug into an existing infrastructure and existing log shippers. It can also connect point-to-point to itself with a high-perf binary encoding. Because you can send any JSON into it, it&#x27;s very easy to get started with together with mobile apps.<p>Logary for JS currently has support for user logs, and I&#x27;m currently testing rudimentary metrics and browser info.<p>Logary for .Net supports the OpenTelemetry spec, structured logging and metrics.<p>Of course you can pick any toolchain you want, but I&#x27;ve had great success (and great fun!) writing and using the above. You can see I don&#x27;t keep logs on disk; it causes them to fill up; if your network is down, your service is down, and then you know it&#x27;s the network anyway.<p>Once in Logary, you can choose where you send them. I&#x27;ve done an analytics&#x2F;ETL pipeline based on Logary with its Stackdriver+BigQuery+GooglePubSub targets and with Flink, with great success as well. Logary is free to use for non-profit and then I have a pricing calculator on the home page, for when you start selling the software you build. Pricing aside, how Logary is structured and how I&#x27;ve used it might give you some hints on how to do it yourself."

For example, if I want someone to help me implement a game using the Unity game engine, I&#x27;d look at the freelancer&#x27;s body of work of past Unity projects. I would be very hesitant to work with someone who is learning Unity for the first time using your platform because that would imply they have no prior experience using that technology.<p>It sounds like your courses are intended as a way to validate a freelancer&#x27;s knowledge -- almost more like a test or certification than a course. I see in another thread that you intend to have users upload a previously completed project, which could be a great way to check their past work, but then I&#x27;m a bit confused as to why they would then need a course.<p>So I guess I feel a bit confused about what I should expect from the people completing the courses -- will these people be freelancers with experience and the courses are just validating that? Will they be freelancers with no prior experience in a particular technology, and they&#x27;re learning it for the first time via your site?

4 Core Machine with 32Gb Ram
about 3000 logs per second. 70% CPU usage and 80% SSD Usage-
Quite happy with the setup, since the SSD can be upgraded to a faster one. Also a more powerfull machine could handle about 10000 logs per second.

2019-08-30,"TL;DR: different people have different programming styles and you might not be programming the way they expect you to; but that might not be the problem. The problem might be that you&#x27;re focusing on the part of the interview that the interviewer doesn&#x27;t care about and that makes it so that the interviewer gets frustrated and doesn&#x27;t see your skill.<p>--<p>When I was younger, I got a chance to work on a game with a friend of mine. My friend was an incredibly skilled programmer, probably one of the best programmers who built things people used or could use, that I knew at the time.<p>I was a competition programmer.<p>We were both learning HTML5 at the time, and we both took on the task in very different ways. I believe we were writing Nibbles (Snake) or something like it, as a learning exercise, each.<p>I learned the basics: arrays, function creation, etc, and then went really fast at building the whole program without testing it, connecting all the pieces together in ways that I assumed would work. In the programming competitions I took part in, 3 people shared one computer, all doing different problems at the same time, so most of us wrote our code on paper before we put it in to the computer.<p>After my whole code for snake was written or at least as much as I wanted to have for a prototype (it&#x27;s been many years since we did this, so I don&#x27;t remember a lot), I started trying to run it. It didn&#x27;t work, of course, or did messy things, and so I spent a bunch of time going through and fixing the bugs that were in my code.<p>My friend went a completely different approach. Of course I don&#x27;t remember specifics, but it was something like this:<p>* he got a pixel drawing in a canvas<p>* he got a pixel moving on the canvas<p>* he got apples appearing on a canvas<p>* he got a chain of pieces of the snake following<p>* he got collision working<p>Of course, this is probably not what actually happened; but, this is basically what I remember about how he coded. He was very slow, methodical, and had a step-by-step process of how the whole code would work.<p>In the end, I think he had his program working before I did and much better; but, if you looked at just the start, you might assume he&#x27;s not skilled.<p>--<p>Let&#x27;s fast forward to today and a different person.<p>I was talking directly to a senior engineer at my company the other day. Very skilled, very, very skilled. We were talking about how we do things. It came out that I design systems and draw pictures to get flow and layout down. I like to work on weird, pie-in-the-sky, robust systems that tend to take a drawing to figure out later, because they&#x27;re powerful and do powerful things; and, the goal of those systems tend to be to pre-emptively be ready for v-next and handle all of the requirements as cleanly as possible, and future requirements as cleanly as possible.<p>He greatly prefers to start hacking on a solution quickly and get something building and then work in the nuance and ugly later, refactoring whole sections over time to get a better and better solution.<p>When I remark on a dangerous test case or scenario area that I&#x27;m worried about when it comes to the upcoming solution, he&#x27;s always thought of that problem area ahead of time, too; but, from what he tells me about how he works, he starts hacking basically right away; and, I don&#x27;t think he does the crazy designs as his first version, either.<p>--<p>I&#x27;m not sure where I&#x27;m going with this; but, I think I want to say that this:<p>&gt;  I ran node in console after small changes and additions to print, test, debug.<p>is not a sufficient reason to think you&#x27;re not senior; but, this:<p>&gt; I didn’t have a mental model of the subtask<p>might be. Please notice that I reduced what I said down to a very, very narrow statement. If you eventually have a mental model, then I think you&#x27;re fine here.<p>--<p>I&#x27;m going to add some more. This might be an interviewing problem, and I think it may be important to get a feel for what sort of interview it is, even asking them. If you&#x27;re adding a bit, printing, testing, adding a bit, printing, testing, you might be adding a bit to things that your testing partner doesn&#x27;t think matters. Did the interviewer expect the code to compile and run proper tests? Or were they just trying to understand your thinking process? If the interview only cares about your thinking process, then they probably don&#x27;t care if you don&#x27;t write the code to get the substring you need exactly right, or they might not care if you get rounding wrong, or output formatting wrong, because that&#x27;s not the part of the problem you&#x27;re being asked to solve.<p>You get better at this by interviewing more and practicing asking questions.<p>--<p>You mention this:<p>&gt; The feedback was you can’t do this when compiling time is long and development will be slow<p>While this is true, for most of the work I do, I could write a small program on the side that tests the design I&#x27;m going for that compiles quickly and then inject that code into the larger code base and test the rigging. Maybe that&#x27;s not how it is for the job you&#x27;re looking at.<p>I&#x27;ve said a lot, I hope this helps."

- Automate existing processes to either reduce the amount of work needed to be done (feature extraction from images or audio, document parsing) or to introduce a higher level of resolution&#x2F;response time. For example forecasts for the next day every day or live detection of audio&#x2F;visual events.<p>- Generating models to extract signals from massive or complex data. Usually once you&#x27;re done here you can revert to traditional methods based on the newfound insights. Rarely is there &quot;magic&quot; solutions to optimize away your problems. In general it proves more to be a tool in the box to do analytics than it is a solution.<p>Either of those create new value and you can put a price on it.

(I actually think this one would be a home-run but it&#x27;s a technical challenge, to create a simulation that triggers someone&#x27;s social anxiety?)<p>One number 1, I think the limiting factor which would shy away potential users is that most would feel their situation is unique.

2019-08-30,"For personalities try Jason Friedman. Martin Fowler&#x27;s Refactoring is a nice read too.<p>But personally, I&#x27;d like to ask what business goal are we looking to solve? Because regardless of how murky a codebase can be, if that codebase keeps hitting a business goal, then we really can&#x27;t drive a change in practices.<p>So, we first present business goals. Here&#x27;s a few examples:<p>If the business goal is to give better estimates for fulfilling custom features faster, then testing would be the first in the list. Not even the release process. Tests lessens cognitive load for developers when they&#x27;re asked &quot;how long can we make this feature?&quot;. They&#x27;ll have an idea that it&#x27;ll probably break a bunch of services, etc. a.) If you&#x27;re in leadership, ask for tests when people make a PR. b.) If you&#x27;re not in leadership, look for the smallest part of the monolith. Write 1 integration test, add a CI integration, put it in a PR. Co-workers would probably like that.<p>If the business goal is to give better SLA&#x27;s (turn around time for addressing breaking bugs, scaling better), then the release process would come first.<p>Regarding technical debt: One way to address technical debt is to slowly address it by folding in the effort of cleaning and refactoring inside a feature request. ex: making a new form about 2FA takes 3 days, but you can say 7 and explain that we&#x27;ll setup a CI test build, then hit and address some debt regarding User Authentication along the way.<p>It&#x27;ll introduce as a &quot;Clean As You Go&quot; culture in the legacy engineering team, which will pay off in the long-run instead of having a huge amount of time just dedicated to addressing technical debt.<p>The danger of separating &quot;address technical debt&quot; as a separate effort is it sometimes results into some unnecessary abstractions and over-refactoring: i.e. trying to make certain things too generic, bordering on building a framework.<p>But then again, if the business goal was to make a framework for a business goal (maybe something the bizdev can sell), then it can definitely be made as a separate effort. Otherwise, it&#x27;ll be seen in the bizdev as someone just &quot;playing&quot; around with tech."

2019-08-30,"Yesterday I decided to write a simple log file watcher because customers especially requested for a simple script with no dependencies on the target machine. It had to detect any new logs that match the given pattern, too.<p>My plan was to detect new files and file modifications using two async tasks. Whenever a new file arrives, open a stream and read. Whenever a file is modified, find the previously opened stream and read. Every time I read, I push it onto an async Queue which will be consumed by another async task. That would emulate something similar to go channels. Multiple IO tasks, that sounds like a job for async&#x2F;await. This was my mental model before I coded a single line.<p>After a few dozen minutes and a single confusing error (I forgot to pass the asyncio loop into the queue and the sleep functions) it was done. I even made it so that it would output the newly appended logs to the stdin of another process or another file. That way I could decouple my log watcher from the program that uses it.<p>I also opted for detecting file changes by using an async timed loop instead of inotify which would both simplify coding and buffer the new data to reduce read&#x2F;write operations.<p>4-5 years ago, I would have experimented with code and tested different ways of accomplishing the same thing. Rather than favoring code experimentation, I had a product idea and implemented a minimal but complete example by reading docs ."
2019-08-30,"Building at least a minimal mental model takes me far less time than trying to jump in and code something without one.  When writing a trivial method&#x2F;function, it often takes only a fraction of a second[1], but having it tells me if I&#x27;m on track to accomplish what I set out to.  The mental model helps you plan and course correct... without it, you&#x27;re likely either learning&#x2F;exploring&#x2F;doodling (which should help you build a mental model) or flailing about.  You can get by on smaller scale&#x2F;solo projects without one but it becomes an issue if you are expected to work in&#x2F;with one more teams and or larger scope&#x2F;scale projects.<p>[1] It takes effort in the early years, but like anything else you work at it does become second nature.

Plus occasional 1 shift weeks so I schedule travel around these periods. 3) You dont have to work 24&#x2F;7. I tend to work from 9-4 then 8-12. So I get morning and afternoon with kids. I&#x27;ll close that gap if needed but that leaves plenty of time for kids. 4) I live on a small farm so I feel this keeps a balance as most days I&#x27;ll be out feeding animal or doing something physical. This way I dont mind being screen heavy. Also I can do activities with the family form the doorset like ride horses&#x2F;dirt bike or do a quick bush walk etc.<p>I find the biggest issues; 1) is ability to take holidays. To shut shop for a few weeks is near impossible in my current situation so I take a laptop everywhere. I feel this is the biggest impact. 2) With consultant work it limits time for the other business. If my partner was a better earner I might focus on the side business full time but seems too risky. I might be more risk friendly here without a family but not incredibly so.<p>A&#x27;so, a bit deep, but whats important to you?

2019-08-30,"Yes, I pretty much have a mental model of what I want to build before I build it.  I am not sure that I build the mental model in 30 minutes, though; rather I get an idea, think about it over the course of many days, talk with people about it, write down some design details, etc.  Only after all of that does any programming begin, and the actual coding is then the easy part.  You know what data structures you need.  You know what the external API will look like.  You know how to deal with the tricky parts; be it integration or some sort of unusually complex algorithm.<p>Doing the design work is what separates senior and non-senior engineers.  The more details you get worked out before they are solidified by having 10 other systems depending on them, the better.<p>If you just do stuff with a rough idea of the direction you want to go in, it&#x27;s very easy to get sidetracked by something that doesn&#x27;t matter.  It&#x27;s also very easy to build something nobody wants.  By having people agree on some sort of semi-detailed design that describes assumptions, corner cases, the API, etc... you dramatically increase your chances of building the computer program that people want.<p>I am not sure how you test for this in an interview... but it is important.

But there are a lot of unnecessary proofs in math: things that seem perfectly obvious and are in fact true, but that require a long and counterintuitive argument to prove.

2019-08-30,"&quot;Do most senior software engineers take time to build a mental model before coding and testing?&quot;<p>I don&#x27;t know. It probably depends on the problem.<p>If I&#x27;ve written anything remotely similar before, I probably come in with a history with the problem at hand and can at least guess what sort of solution might work.<p>If I&#x27;ve never written anything remotely similar I just need to sketch a lot to a paper, and try out things in code before I implement anything.<p>I don&#x27;t know what the interview was actually like. But no one has been able to verbalize exactly the specific behaviour of a good programmer. The best gauge of good programmer is that they identify each other.<p>Now, this key factor also has a hidden catch. People are different! Nobody has identified that there is only one true way of being a top performer.<p>So, when you are interviewing, the interviewer has a specific model in her head ... of what a top performer is like to her.<p>But as far as I know, no one has done any research how many &quot;top performer archetypes&quot; there are.<p>So, I would say it&#x27;s intellectually faulty to say there is only one way of being a senior contributor. Senior contributors output is gauged in production.<p>On the other hand, the only way to find top performers is to ask for other top performers to find them. And they are not necessarily expert psychologists, they just know how they work, and maybe have some notion of what the organization supports.<p>The interviewer might have had some archetype in their head that you did not fit with, but could not exactly verbalize, so they tried to generate anything resembling a reasonable rationalization for their intuition. So the actual problem might not have been your &quot;lack of mental model&quot;, but some other unspecified lack of affinity with the specific way of working the interviewer expected (reasonably or not).<p>So there might be ways to be awesome that are unfamiliar to the interviewer, that they just don&#x27;t understand.<p>On the other hand, they&#x27;ve likely seen what works in their organization and what does not, and that feeds into their intuition as well.<p>So the best way to ace an interview at an organization, is to psychologically match with the other top performers in the organization.<p>And the best way to suck at an interview is to be technically incompetent for the seat they are hiring - in this case no psychological affinity is going to help in the short term. But how to <i>think</i>, or how exactly to solve problems... that&#x27;s a stretch to say there is only one way to do it. It sounds to me at worst it will lead to groupthink and lack of innovation opportunities due to cognitive monoculture.<p>Sorry, I don&#x27;t actually know how to pass a FAANG interview or what you need for it."

2019-08-30,"The point of unions is that unlike in tech, where workers are in high demand and paid a silly amount and get company swag and ball pits or whatever so feel happy enough, in most industries and areas people are treated and paid as poorly as companies can get away with because they are expendable commoditised labour.<p>Unions are historically a way of fighting for more rights (e.g. better wages, sick pay) for workers by collective organisation (i.e. pay us enough so we can eat, or we will all down tools and stop your factory doing anything).<p>The arguments against unions are that they are too powerful and mean people who are poor at their job cannot be fired, but I would argue that they are very much still necessary because the nature of capitalism and employment hasn&#x27;t change particularly much, and without them companies would absolutely start taking the piss as much as they possibly can because it is their function to extract capital from workers&#x27; labour as efficiently as possible.<p>I would suggest that perhaps tech workers could join unions en-mass to fight for the rights of less privileged workers - ie if the cleaner can&#x27;t eat or pay rent, you don&#x27;t get your PRs merged, but I think that would take a level of altruism that is far beyond most people in this sector.<p>You have to pay union dues because they will do things like cover people&#x27;s wages during strikes, provide people legal support when they are being unfairly dismissed, etc."

After learning an FP approach some iterative&#x2F;OOP approaches can feel alien, but they&#x27;re still valid and widely used and that&#x27;s likely what you&#x27;ll be learning.

2019-08-30,"14 years in the industry, and I often describe typing the code as the easy part of software engineering. Once I&#x27;m typing the code, I already know in large part what code needs to be typed. The hard part was understanding the problem model enough to know what code to type.<p>That being said, executing the code while typing it is critical. You cannot build a mental model of all edge cases. At best, your personal discipline will allow you have habits around preventing and catching edge cases. But you won&#x27;t find enough edge cases just by thinking about the code to type. You do have to discover them by running the code, and the sooner you discover them, the faster you will be at producing high quality code.<p>As far as how much time I spend building a mental model vs coding... It&#x27;s at least half mental model time. If I happen to predict enough edge cases, then it might be 90% of the time. But the critical part is that I&#x27;m not done until I&#x27;ve exhausted the edge cases I can imagine. If I discover sufficiently big edge cases that brick my code, it&#x27;s time to step away from the computer and fix my broken mental model.<p>Note: tests are a way to do this, but so is white box poking and prodding at your program in debug mode."
2019-08-30,"I manage a team that directly uses ML to create software services that our customers pay money to use. This is relatively rare. Most ML applications are internal - your customer is your own company. In this case, you should think of yourself as an in-house ML consultancy for your company. You need to reliably create value for the company, and be able to measure it.<p>In my opinion, there are three business &quot;tiers&quot; of ML.<p>1. Process automation. You&#x27;re turning a defined business process currently done by a human into something automated, with some custom rule logic, of which some of it may be via ML-trained models. The easiest, because the criteria are well-defined and everyone knows what success looks like.<p>2. Data Mining&#x2F;Analysis&#x2F;Insight. Your company sits on some unexploited set of data, and you want to generate useful business insight from it. ML models can help make sense of it. This takes the traditional business intelligence function to the next level. Harder, because you may need to educate the company on what ML offers. They may not even realize what types of new questions ML can answer.<p>3. Customer-facing automated-decision services. This is the most demanding application from a business perspective, but not necessarily from a technical perspective. The standards for quality, stability, accuracy, should be much, much higher. If it&#x27;s customer-facing, it can&#x27;t mess up, or people will stop trusting it. The customer may be internal or external."

2019-08-30,"Yes - it&#x27;s essential for debugging.<p>Your mental model tells you that if the system is in a given state, and receives a given input, what &quot;should&quot; happen. You can then look for evidence whether those things happened and narrow down a bug.<p>It also works the other way. If, given this input, that happened, your mental model tells you what the system state must have been. That can help you work backwards to identify a bug that put the system into a bad state."
2019-08-30,"Yes, it&#x27;s important to develop a habit to plan ahead before coding. For anything bigger than small scripts or utilities, you need to do this.<p>On the other hand, there&#x27;s the eternal conflict between the waterfall model and the iterative development model. The waterfall model dictates planning (almost) everything ahead, while the iterative model says plan sufficiently far ahead, then start coding, then take a break and re-evaluate, do some more planning, do some more coding, rinse, repeat. I certainly prefer an iterative model, and building prototypes, as you do. But even then, I&#x27;d say professional development work is 90% planning ahead, and only 10% actual coding.

2019-08-30,"FAANG interviews aside, I find the idea of having a mental model before you write code extremely helpful. It&#x27;s a lot easier to understand the purpose of individual functions and how things should interface with each other if you do. It won&#x27;t be perfect at first, but the more you can get right in the first stab the better.<p>Your ability to build that mental model depends on both your experience&#x2F;skill and the complexity of the problem. For simple problems, a more senior engineer might be able to come up with a mental model instantly because it&#x27;s similar to lots of things they&#x27;ve done before. For really complex problems, it probably takes everyone a long time to build the correct mental model and you&#x27;d want to balance that with what you can figure out by diving into the implementation.<p>My guess would be that the interviewers&#x27; line of thinking is that if you couldn&#x27;t build a mental model for a problem quickly, that means you&#x27;re not proficient with problems like that. Which is probably true, but opens up the question of whether the interview is testing the right type of problem, of course."

In fact,  &quot;functioning as a team&quot; is the real magic.  If you have a group of average developers who are perfectly coordinated you can beat a group of dev&#x27;s who all want to be the prima donna."

My main point is that the learning never stops, and you&#x27;ll benefit from accepting that you are responsible for teaching yourself.  Being fully dependent on a TA or professor to shove knowledge into your head is a good formula for hating a class when you start to understand the teacher isn&#x27;t as good as teaching as you hoped they would be.<p>Lastly, learning is a lot harder if you aren&#x27;t working on something fun, too.  For example, if you&#x27;re taking a class on databases and it&#x27;s about as interesting as watching paint dry, maybe doing something more hands on involving databases would be fun.  For example, I enjoy doing things like shaving microseconds of the amount of time it takes to query a table, and pushing the boundaries of what is possible helps me understand a whole lot about why that database was designed that way in the first place, which compliments the course material very nicely."
2019-08-30,"It depends on how free college is implemented. If it’s a voucher system, where students get a certain amount to spend, the ISA night go away if the voucher covers the full cost of education. Otherwise, an ISA could still be used to cover the excess funds.<p>If the money goes directly to the institution, and the price exposed to students is always $0, the ISA goes away completely.<p>Regardless of how we implement free college, there will most likely not be a restriction on the existence of programs that are not free. These programs may have a drastically smaller market, but a market of some sort may still exist. This is primarily due to [my guesstimation] that we simply don’t have enough seats and beds to cover every high school student going to college."

2019-08-29,"There is considerable motivation to reduce the need for programmer labor- programmers are one of the most expensive ingredients in producing many digital products and services. Many companies have made headlines with promises of visual programming tools and&#x2F;or machine learning leading to &quot;codeless software&quot;, but they are consistently either pure snake oil, highly limited in scope, or &quot;mechanical turks&quot; which obscure the role of human labor for marketing purposes.<p>Many limited domains have been &quot;solved&quot; from the perspective of having software available which allows non-technical users to suit their own needs: You can make a blog, a web store, or a wiki without any knowledge of HTML or a programming language. Yet even in these spaces, there are still users with a desire for custom solutions, and thus a market. There will always be new problems to solve- or old problems to solve better- requiring fresh ingenuity.<p>Marketing spin aside, I have seen zero evidence that progress has been made in replacing humans with software for the task of turning vague requirements into concrete, precise, machine-readable specifications. As long as that holds, software engineering as a profession will not disappear."
2019-08-29,"My comment is going to cover some of the answers given by others but here is my view of the situation.<p>Management&#x2F;HR:
1. They don&#x27;t know programming (to them it&#x27;s magic).
2. They are afraid of paying for people who are less than rockstar. If they can&#x27;t keep up with the Googles and Facebooks then they can&#x27;t succeed they hear.
3. Technology&#x2F;market has been moving faster than developers can develop. Need it yesterday is the theme management dances to and they don&#x27;t care about paying you 30 hours of overtime if they can get something to market this week instead 2 weeks later under a relaxed deadline.
4. All computers work like Star Trek because Siri can tell them the weather according to their logic.<p>Programmers:
1. Starting your own framework or library just to advertise&#x2F;divide the mindshare of other programmers instead of collaborating.
2. Not knowing how to interview candidates correctly (talk about programming? nah, just come up with a programming whiteboard then nickpick them to death to find one good enough to play sidekick.).
3. Working for less&#x2F;putting in too many hours. Working for less brings the profession down and putting in too many hours reinforces the idea that only good programmers put in loads of overtime.<p>Of course this isn&#x27;t 100% spot on for every company, market and country but it is what I see most of the time."

2019-08-29,"Large employers attempt to do this quite often, even in states that specifically forbid it in state statue.  Some states have laws that prevent this behavior but it doesn&#x27;t stop employers from trying to bully those without knowledge.<p>I personally would be highly suspicious of any startup that was trying this while simultaneously offering or paying you a below market wage.  If a company wants your attention they should pay to hold it, not threaten your job because you take a side job to make more money or have a hobby.<p>Another similar policy to this is the &quot;assignment of all inventions&quot;, related and unrelated to the company, done on or off company time and even done using personal equipment.  Again, some states prevent this, and even in states that don&#x27;t have specific laws preventing it, generally I have seen the legal system is remiss to allow employers these wide unfettered control over peoples private lives.<p>Also, this is a reason you should write down every thought, idea or actual stuff you have worked on as excluded works before signing any document about inventions, non-compete etc.  While I 100% disagree with the concept of these policies, there are ways around them almost all the time if you plan ahead.<p>This is also always something up for negotiation when you are being hired.  The companies first response is almost always well this is the only way we hire anyone, and your response to that is what matters.  It is also your first look at what the company really thinks of employees, if they care they&#x27;ll figure a way to work with you, assuming you aren&#x27;t being unreasonable yourself. If they are there to use you as a cog then they&#x27;ll say no to all reasonable requests and that should be your warning sign to walk.  I had people tell me you can&#x27;t get more vacation back in the day when 2 weeks was the norm in the U.S. for all new employees. And here I&#x27;d be hired and have 4 weeks the first year and people were pissed cause they didn&#x27;t negotiate it.

2019-08-29,"I would recommend understanding computer architecture first. The basics of CPUs, memory, I&#x2F;O and instruction sets. Once you understand the &quot;host&quot; environment which is very real, being cast into silicon, you are in a better position to understand how languages provide you with abstractions for using those resources.<p>Personally I would recommend SICP since it will introduce you to concepts which are also in the Haskell book. But SICP with Scheme covers a far wider range of abstractions.<p>Python is a good first language because you can program in pure functional or pure object-oriented forms and by combining the two recognise where one or the other is the most effective abstraction to employ.<p>In practice I like to define objects which I then use in a functional manner.  If you read the specifications for Scheme, you will discover that the functional operations on objects is the most fundamental paradigm that is being used. cf pages 3 &amp; 5 &quot;The Scheme of Programming Language - second edition&quot;."
2019-08-29,"For tracing, Zipkin is a good place to end up.<p>But before you get there, you can standardize on a &quot;request ID&quot; header that gets passed through your call stack and logged by whatever services receive it.

For example, each network request the mobile app makes to the backend should have a request ID. The mobile app includes that request ID in all its log entries and sends it with the request. The backend plumbs it through everywhere and all its log entries have it, too.

You can spin up a cheap cluster for under 200$ and start instrumenting your servers to send stuff to it. You&#x27;ll want to set up index life cycle management to ensure you don&#x27;t run out of disk space on your cluster. You scale by throwing more money at it. Basically you need to think in terms of millions of messages per day and retention periods. A 200$ cluster should be able to retain tens of millions of messages.<p>That&#x27;s how you get started. There are plenty of tools on this stack to do APM, security auditing, request logging, etc. If you are using a decent application server stack that produces metrics, it can handle those too."

2019-08-29,"First, centralized logging is not just a good idea -- its key when you start working with multiple servers (which will most likely be almost right away).  You need to be able to trace requests &#x2F; responses &#x2F; errors across your platform.  Many tools (including logging library -&gt; database and a custom log search &#x2F; viewer) can give you this.  Just pick something that works for your budget and development process and start there.  To track a single chain of events, you&#x27;ll just need to have a GUID that you pass between calls in a single request (used for logging).<p>Next, you&#x27;ll want to track analytics centrally.  Etsy and Netflix have been pioneers in this area.  Their engineering blogs are very good to follow.  Think: something like a timeseries database (like Influx &#x2F; Prometheus) and getting data into it.  Use tools like Grafana to get data out of it in dashboards or reports.  This is separate from your application debug &#x2F; error logging system.<p>The next step after this is developing something that consumes data from both of those systems and provides alerts based on unusual activity -- something that provides early warning to devops."

While I&#x27;m sure some companies exist that match the above description, I&#x27;ve more typically seen numerous siloed teams, with their own codebases, with both loose and tight coupling to other teams, with a variety of processes, and therefore a variety of quality around the teams.<p>So it is not as simple as just picking a universal pain point and transitioning to a new process. It is about understanding the drivers and history that got each team to where they are, picking apart which of those drivers is still relevant, and looking for shared pain points between teams that are now open to change due to changes in the business since things were set up.<p>Because of this, I&#x27;d focus less on the technical side, and more on communications and business, as those are the rabbit holes you&#x27;ll need to go down to build consensus from multiple teams to mutually move to a better place."

2019-08-28,"I&#x27;m going to disagree with most of the commenters here.<p>Start with Haskell.<p>&quot;Data dominates. If you&#x27;ve chosen the right data structures and organized things well, the algorithms will almost always be self-evident. Data structures, not algorithms, are central to programming.&quot;
-Rob Pike<p>Sicp is great. But sicp won&#x27;t elucidate the above fact to you which is central to modern programming. Modern programming is about managing things that are complex beyond the ability for a human to comprehend completely.<p>Too many programmers are concerned with the details. What&#x27;s even more alarming is that most programmers say they test for how detailed a person is in a time limited programming interview.<p>Your ability to be detailed will never be able to scale with the complexity of programs so greater ability to be detailed doesn&#x27;t lead to any benefites in the long run.<p>To build robust applications you must be able to ignore details.<p>Learning Haskell will teach you how to ignore details by eliminating detail as a rule. Counterintuitively, Haskell is much less detailed then scheme, python or almost every other popular language out there. I am not referring to syntax here, I am referring to the amount of ways to go from A to B. Haskell makes this dichotomy more evident and the algorithm that takes you from A to B less relevant. Haskell is more restrictive and less expressive, and restriction is power.<p>Haskell does have issues though, that being the nature of side effects. The abstractions to deal with such things are so mind bending that it might not be good to dive too deep into the world of categories. It depends. But the main point you want get from learning Haskell has to do with the Rob Pike quote above. Once you understand that you&#x27;ll be better then 99 percent of other programmers on the things that are relevant to modern programming. Then if you&#x27;re interested you can continue further into Haskell or jump to Sicp as you got the main point.<p>The study of Haskell eventually leads to category theory which almost looks like a formal theory of abstraction of systems and modules which alludes to the possibility of &#x27;deriving&#x27; programs rather then using our gut to &#x27;design&#x27; them. It&#x27;s mind opening to go further but not critical.<p>Ironically Rob Pike is part of the golang team which is a language that hinders your ability to express all forms of data structures. Json cannot be properly described by the type system of that language so while his quotation is correct I don&#x27;t agree with many of his decisions."

2019-08-28,"I&#x27;ve semi-seriously been considering starting my own OS project to circumvent some of the IO latency issues with VR and AR applications.<p>The big metric is motion-to-photon latency, which is a measure (in milliseconds) of how quickly a user&#x27;s head motion is reflected on the display. Anything greater than ~10ms is considered insufficient, as you&#x27;ve missed a whole frame of rendering for VR headsets that run at 90hz refresh rate.<p>Current XR applications need to wait for the USB or Bluetooth stack to return the head pose before modifying the view, then wait for the graphics stack to reflect that change. There are many ring transitions along the way. This leads to an absolute minimum motion-to-photon latency that can&#x27;t be broken just because of OS overhead. This eats into your frame budget, as every ms of context-switching out of the IO drivers leaves you fewer ms to render a frame in time to get it back into the kernel for context-switching back to the graphics driver."

2019-08-28,"Yes, you want to have a single chain of events across all of your infrastructure.  This is called &quot;distributed tracing&quot;.  There are a few solutions available; I recommend Jaeger.<p>You do need to instrument your applications to emit traces, but don&#x27;t go overboard.  Make sure everything can extract the trace ID from headers &#x2F; metadata and that requests they generate include the trace ID.  Most languages have plugins for their HTTP &#x2F; gRPC server and client libraries to do this automatically.<p>You will want your edge proxy to start the trace for you; this is very easy with Envoy and ... possible ... with nginx and the opentracing plugins.<p>I use structured logs (zap specifically), so I wrote an adaptor that accepts a context.Context for a given request, extracts the trace ID from that (and x-b3-sampled), and logs it with every line.  This means that when I&#x27;m looking at logs, I can easily cut-n-paste the ID into Jaeger to look at the entire request, or if I&#x27;m looking at a trace, type the ID into Kibana and see every log line associated with the request.  (The truly motivated engineer would modify the Jaeger UI to pull logs along with spans since they&#x27;re both stored in ES.  Someday I will do this.)<p>As for log storage and searching, every existing solution is terrible and you will hate it.  I used ELK.  With 4 Amazon-managed m4.large nodes... it still takes forever to search our tiny amount of logs (O(GB&#x2F;day)).  It took me days to figure out how to make fluentd parse zap&#x27;s output properly.  And every time I use Kibana, I curse it as the query language does overly-broad full-text searches, completely ignoring my query and then spending a minute to return all log lines that contain the letter &quot;a&quot; or something.  &quot;kubectl logs xxx | grep whatever&quot; was my go-to searching solution.  Fast and free.<p>If anyone wants to pay me to write a sane log storage and searching system... send me an email ;)"

If you log directly over network, if things fail the very log messages you need to troubleshoot the failure are potentially gone.<p>3) Visualize. Create alerts.<p>I&#x27;ve evaluated a bunch of logging solutions. Splunk is the best, and affordable at low data volumes (they have a pricing calculator, you can check for yourself). It&#x27;s medium hard to setup.<p>Sumo Logic is the easiest to set up, and at low data volumes, prices are similar to Splunk.

2019-08-28,"Original Skype for Web developer here. I was part of the launch team who built the first version for this product in 2014[1]. Back then we supported Chrome, IE 9+, Safari and Firefox. Already we had internal debates to support Opera, but the decision was to focus on the largest browsers.<p>For each browser, we had to add support in our standalone plugin, that was (and still is) required to install for audio&#x2F;video calls. There was a small maintenance cost per browser, which was a bigger one whenever changes to the plug-in were made.<p>I left Skype&#x2F;Microsoft a long time ago and Microsoft announced in March they will drop support for Firefox[2]. I can only speculate, but it’s likely due to not wanting to pay the maintenance cost of this product on an ongoing basis.<p><i>Not directly related story from building Skype for Web:</i> a big internal battle those days was us vs the Edge team. We wanted Edge to ship the Skype plugin as default, making calls seamless for Edge users, not needing to install a plugin (we saw large drops in adoption due to this plugin). Chrome already did exactly this with Hangouts back in the day and we saw it as them eating our lunch.<p>This was at the time of Steve Balmer’s Microsoft, where collaboration between different orgs was difficult and facing strong political headwind. We got nowhere with the Edge team, who wanted no dependencies and prioritised performance above anything like this - and also wanted to hit their own KPIs, which had nothing to do with Skype users preferring to use Edge.<p>We reasoned, pleaded, argued, steamed, shouted names and even used the &quot;C&quot; argument (&quot;but... but... but... even Chrome does it!&quot;). No avail. So a separate plugin install it was, giving people zero incentive to use a Microsoft browser for a Microsoft product. The Edge team were pleased they did not have to cater for another dependency and their roadmap remained unchanged. We were frustrated and had little doubt which brodwser will keep gaining market share - being certain it will not be IE&#x2F;Edge.<p><i>Other not directly related story</i>: a few years ago I wrote in detail my take on why Skype failed, here on HN.

Solve it in a way that also works for the other situations you expect it is needed (i.e. make absolutely everything that&#x27;s unique to this first implementation a configuration item outside the unit or callable via an abstraction&#x2F;extra interface from the specific use). This is easier to do if designing something for multiple places at once.
i.e. Make it modular from the start. This requires more work up-front.<p>I work in embedded so we reuse: device drivers, MCU abstraction layers, communication protocols, key (to our business) areas of application level logic.<p>Reusing components is about reusing design, which ultimately means you&#x27;re reusing&#x2F;extending a specification as well.

2019-08-28,"&gt; trace a single chain of events across platforms<p>Since it sounds like you also control the app, maybe make an HTTP header that the app sends that has some kind of UUID for that transaction.  When your backend gets it, keep passing it on and logging it as part of your context when you emit log lines.  Then using whatever log aggregation system you use, you can search for that UUID.<p>As for collecting your logs, I like ELK stacks, and they are easy to set up and get all your syslogging to go there.  There are also ready made helm charts to install these into a kubernetes cluster if you&#x27;re using that, and they will automatically scoop up everything logged to stdout&#x2F;stderr."
2019-08-28,"Since others have answered with specific tech stacks, I&#x27;ll give a more generalized&#x2F;abstracted answer. While getting started, here are a few high-level principles I found useful to adhere that will make your life easier later:<p>Think of a multi-stage pipeline for getting raw data from your transactional&#x2F;interaction systems and extracting insights and intelligence out of them.<p>Stage-1: Ingestion – Keep this simple. Don&#x27;t mess this up. Its a serious headache if you do.<p>1. Generate a request-id or message-id at the genesis of the request and propagate it throughout your call graph from client to servers (across any number of api call graph hops).<p>2. At each node in the call graph, emit whatever logs you want to emit, include this id.<p>3. Use whatever format you find natural and easy to use in each tech stack environment. Key is to make the logging instrumentation very natural and normal to each codebase such that the instrumentation does not get accidentally broken while adding new features.<p>4. Build a plumbing layer (agnostic of what is being logged) that can locally buffer these log messages, periodically compress and package them with added sequence and integrity verification mechanisms, and reliability transmit them to a central warehouse. Use this across all your server-side nodes. Build a similar one for each of your client side platforms.<p>5. At the central warehouse, immediately persist these log packages durably and then only respond to client indicating it is safe to purge those packages on their local nodes.<p>Stage-2: Use-case driven ETLs.<p>6. Come up with use-cases to consume this data. Define data tables (facts and dimensions) needed to support these consumption use case.<p>7. Build a high-performance stream processing system that can process the raw log packages for doing ETL (extract, transform and load) on the raw data in different formats to the defined consumable data tables.<p>Stage-3: Actual Use-case data applications.<p>Run your analytics and machine learning systems on top of these stable consumable data formats.<p>Keep the stages separate and decoupled in code and systems. Don&#x27;t do end-to-end optimizations and break the boundaries. Recognize that the actors&#x2F;stakeholders involved in each stage are different. The job of data team is to be the guardian of these stages and run the systems and org processes to support it."
2019-08-28,Never centralize logging. Log at the leaves and store it there. Push search predicates down to servers running on each leaf when&#x2F;if needed. Log to sockets always; your FD can be a regular file if you want but keep the flexibility to change it later.

Fourier Ptychography is basically a variation of Gerchberg-Saxton phase retrieval in the sense that both methods and their variations reconstruct images from constraints. In Ptychography for microscopy they come from low-resolution, small-Field-of-View image captures. You can do superresolution with it and extend your field of view.<p>Usually in microscopy, you have a very limited field of view but with  the variations of this method, people have reconstructed multiple square-mm fields of view with a µm resolution. If you have multiple cameras, you can speed up the process [1].

I have tried to code some, including mixed integer LP, and applied them to multiple problems. I did this such that I could get a deeper understanding which sort of optimization algorithm is suited and well-performing for which kind of problem.<p>So far my results have been very inconsistent: sometimes genetic algorithms produce surprisingly good results, other times simulated annealing proves to be the clear winner, sometimes a plain old depth-first search,  with a custom scoring heuristic produces greatest results...

2019-08-27,"This is something that I&#x27;ve struggled with myself so I can only give you advice as I&#x27;ve learned it from my perspective.<p>Math is a big field so you have to understand what parts you&#x27;re really interested in and how you want information to be presented so that you&#x27;ll learn it. For example, I&#x27;m interested in computation aspects of mathematics (information theory, computation group theory, abstract algebra, analysis, etc.) and I always prefer a &quot;computer programmers&quot; intuition in how to learn these subjects. That is, understanding how to &#x27;program it&#x27;, whatever that means for the different subjects I&#x27;m interested in.<p>Here is a small list of intuition I&#x27;ve learned about finding good resources:<p>* Books, and sometimes textbooks, are still a valuable resource. It&#x27;s still the case that having a book on a subject that has curated content is better than the random Wikipedia articles or blog posts on the subject. Use Wikipedia, obviously, and look at blog posts, but I search for books in the subject area, especially if it&#x27;s a field I&#x27;m not familiar with.<p>* When looking for books, prefer books that have &quot;elementary&quot; in the title, as in &quot;elementary introduction&quot;. The more &quot;advanced&quot; books are talking about the bounds of research in the area, often fussing over esoteric issues whereas the &quot;elementary&quot; books give the foundation of knowledge in that area.<p>* Ideally for me, books would have &quot;fundamental algorithms&quot; somewhere in the title, as these books usually are exactly what I need to understand a field.<p>* When reading, ideally I make sure to do the exercises or run through the proofs myself. Mathematics is not a spectator sport and a large part of it is &quot;learn by doing&quot;. Finding good resources so those exercises are meaningful is hard but they still need to be done.<p>* I often check MathOverflow, MathUndeflow, Physics.Stackexchange, CStheory.Stackexchange and other accompanying sites. There are a surprising number of good answers to questions of the form &quot;what is the motivation behind...&quot;. As the subjects get more esoteric, these questions become more infrequent these resources are still invaluable. Asking questions on these sites is also an option and usually helpful.<p>* In the past I&#x27;ve watched more in depth lectures from mathematicians, either from conferences or from things like OpenCourseWare. There&#x27;s a lot of &#x27;folklore&#x27; wisdom that&#x27;s embedded with people that sometimes comes out when viewing actual researchers talk about their research that wouldn&#x27;t otherwise be apparent or emphasized in papers.<p>* I sometimes visit blogs from mathematicians or about mathematicians.<p>When I was younger in college, I was fortunate to have a social group of friends who were graduate students and TAs that had an appetite for discovery and teaching. There was a lot of folklore and intuition that was taught which would have been difficult to find otherwise. I think many graduate students in mathematics essentially use their exposure to their advisor, other teachers and other students to build that intuition.<p>I should also mention that there isn&#x27;t &quot;one way&quot; to learn about these subjects. I take a computational perspective because that&#x27;s my preference but I&#x27;m fully aware that not everyone thinks that way. Every person has their own perspective on what&#x27;s fundamental and how they learn and build intuition even if they can be grouped in to rough categorizations (though I&#x27;d be hard pressed to quantify those categorizations). I&#x27;ve found the way I learn and optimize for it and I unfortunately have a hard time when information isn&#x27;t presented in the way I need it to be, at least initially while I&#x27;m building intuition and learning a subject for the first time.<p>I can&#x27;t find the quote now but there was a mathematician that was talking about Erdos and how Erdos didn&#x27;t have deep knowledge or at least didn&#x27;t use &quot;higher mathematics&quot; like Lie theory or other higher abstractions. Yet Erdos was prolific in his sense with his &quot;elementary&quot; methods, probably because he understood his tools and the problems deeply. As an analogy, it&#x27;d be like someone who knows assembly well trying to analyze a Haskell script. The Haskell programmer might have intuition from the constructs of that language but someone who knows assembly well understands that each of the abstractions in Haskell must eventually boil down to assembly instructions and can understand it from that perspective.<p>I also try to employ the &quot;20% effort for 80% gain&quot; rule. There are usually some basic concepts so learning them as fast as possible is the goal. This also allows for maximum gain for effort spent as if the field is interesting, I can dive deeper or move onto another if it&#x27;s not.<p>I try to avoid resources that are &quot;TED talk&quot; like, press releases, or other &quot;feel good&quot; resources, like 3Brown1Blue. These are great for being inspired by mathematics (which is important!) but are usually devoid of content. Resources like 3Brown1Blue I find especially pernicious as they couch deep understanding by regurgitating facts without providing any fundamental insight.<p>I tend to stay away from Springer books as they&#x27;re usually dense. They might be good for reference but for initial learning I&#x27;ve found them to be pretty bad.<p>People often say &quot;read the original papers&quot; but I found this to be horrible advice as the original papers often are a very rough &#x27;proto&#x27; model of the ideas presented and don&#x27;t benefit from work that&#x27;s been done to simplify and extract the important parts of the theory without the cruft. Often times, mathematicians have their own pet notation which further get in the way of understanding. One exception is Shannon&#x27;s paper on information theory.<p>In no particular order, here are a list of books I&#x27;ve found exceptional (very much catered to my personal taste):<p>[0] Computers and Intractability: A Guide to the Theory of NP-Completeness by Garey and Johnsen<p>[1] The Way of Analysis by Strichartz<p>[2] Introduction to Algorithms by Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest and Stein<p>[3] Fundamental Problems of Algorithmic Algebra by Yap<p>[4] Fundamental Algorithms for Permutation Groups by Butler<p>[5] A Mathematical Theory of Communication by Shannon<p>[6] Complexity and Criticality by Christensen and Moloney<p>I have not found what I consider exceptional texts on number theory, Galois theory or cryptography.<p>Here are some blogs I occasional visit:<p>[7] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rjlipton.wordpress.com&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rjlipton.wordpress.com&#x2F;</a> - Godel&#x27;s Lost Letter and P=NP<p>[8] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;terrytao.wordpress.com&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;terrytao.wordpress.com&#x2F;</a> - Terrence Tao&#x27;s blog<p>Here are the SO sites:<p>[9] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mathoverflow.net"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mathoverflow.net</a> - Math overflow<p>[10] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;math.stackexchange.com&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;math.stackexchange.com&#x2F;</a> - Math &quot;underflow&quot;<p>[11] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;physics.stackexchange.com&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;physics.stackexchange.com&#x2F;</a> - Physics SE<p>[12] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cstheory.stackexchange.com&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cstheory.stackexchange.com&#x2F;</a> - Theoretical Computer Science SE<p>Math videos:<p>[13] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.msri.org&#x2F;videos&#x2F;dashboard"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.msri.org&#x2F;videos&#x2F;dashboard</a> -  MSRI Videos"

Speeds aren&#x27;t as important as just the ability to communicate, i.e. at least a text chat system.<p>You could do something like meshing with HAM or other radios (or combine a lot of messing networks together depending on the hop distance). We can already communicate globally with HAM.<p>The question to me is how do we advance this more for higher reliability, better speeds, and create tools that everyone can use (essentially a zero, or low, knowledge system, like a cellphone). The major factor I see is reliability, so that it is difficult for an oppressive regime to shut it down (would also serve as an extremely reliable method when other systems fail during things like natural disasters. You can probably see more advantages to this backbone network). So we could have an open alternative to the segmenting internet that is currently happening. I honestly believe global communication is one of the fundamental necessities to achieving a more peaceful world."

It took years to realize and resolve all of the various underlying issues before I started feeling comfortable without being complacent with things.<p>My advice for people new to remote work: reserve an hour each morning for exercise, start reading fiction, try out the keto diet, avoid alcohol as much as possible, try to limit your caffeine intake, open your windows to prevent co2 buildup, keep eye drops within reach for long hauls, try to get all of your chores done in the morning."
2019-08-27,"Having seen many employees grow their careers quickly by ping-ponging jobs at Microsoft and Amazon (and vice-versa), I’m thinking about a platform for enabling this. Essentially you would put in your level, current company, and genre of jobs you are interested in and the platform would find jobs for you which are the next level up and help you apply. The employer would have no idea you were using the platform. I’ve seen a handful of people boost their salary very quickly this way right out of college."

2019-08-27,"Try and understand how you learn. A lot of intuition in technical fields, not just in mathematics, is understanding the material in a way that you understand it.<p>For me it was trying to frame as much as possible in a geometric lens. Draw pictures of anything and everything as much as possible. Graphs, number lines, 3d animations, whatever it takes.<p>Also, understand the &quot;bold print&quot; from the &quot;fine print&quot;. I mean to say, every theorem will make a general statement, and then have a bunch of conditions where it holds. So worry first about the bold print, then try to understand the fine print.<p>Much of mathematics is about making the strongest and most general statements in bold print with as little fine print as possible. Basically the less fine print you have, the more important probably your result is."

2019-08-27,"My somewhat off-beat recommendation is &quot;Lions&#x27; Commentary on UNIX 6th Edition with Source Code&quot;. The sources to a 1976 version of Unix written in an archaic dialect of C and targeting a long-dead CPU architecture are obviously not of immediate relevance to the modern world, and may well not be to your taste unless you already have some sympathy with the idea of retrocomputing. But if you do: 6th Edition is small enough that you really can read through the whole set of sources and understand pretty much how the whole thing is put together; the basic bones of the design are not so far away from Linux, so it gives you a workable conceptual model of what the shape of the Linux sources are and what the various important parts are; the commentary is really good, explaining the inscrutable but nudging you to figure things out yourself too; and overall it is practice in reading a large volume of somebody else&#x27;s code, which is something you&#x27;re going to be doing all the time if you work on Linux or any modern kernel. You probably also want a more theoretical and general book too, of course."

2019-08-27,"I&#x27;ve been working 100% remotely for the past three years. I guess the specific challenges depend a bit on the nature of your work -- I used to struggle a lot with feeling isolated when I was doing more pure development work, but my job now (technical interviewing) requires a lot of video chat so I&#x27;m getting lots of face-to-face communication with teammates and candidates, and I rarely feel isolated or lonely.<p>The downside to having lots of video chat is that I&#x27;m really constrained to working from somewhere with good internet, and somewhere without a lot of ambient noise -- which somewhat ruins the &quot;work from anywhere&quot; appeal. It&#x27;s definitely a trade-off I can live with, though.<p>Aside from those things, I&#x27;m honestly struggling to really come up with something that sucks about remote work.

Supposed new frontiers (AR&#x2F;VR, self driving cars) have largely disappointed. The problems (the <i>real</i> problems) we face today like climate change, growing income inequality, stagnating public transit, aren&#x27;t really solvable by most of us in tech. In fact, in retrospect I wonder how many problems we were really solving anyway (is Uber just a giant VC investment bubble? Will we look back on it as a distraction from improving public transit?)<p>...so yeah, I dunno. Feels like we&#x27;re in a fallow year or few.

2019-08-27,"It&#x27;s probably too hard to answer the general question about &quot;how to gain math intuition&quot;. Mathematics is just too vast.<p>However, you have written<p>&gt; I think when I took physics it really brought out these flaws and lack of intuition<p>which suggests you have some good practical experience with physics problem solving which has precipitated a certain feeling that you need to learn more about some kind of math. I would advise that you try to exploit this. In the same breath I want to recognize (as someone who did their BS and MS in physics) that physicists are not always so careful or explicit in how they are doing their mathematics. So learning means eventually going beyond physics sources and into a much wider world of mathematical thought. The particular things that mathematicians care about may or may not be relevant to the problem you are trying to solve in physics, and a good part of developing that intuition is to figure out which particular caveats that a mathematician expounds upon (more often than not, some esoterica about the space(s) that they are working in or the class of isomorphisms under which their results are invariant) matter physically. As you develop and intuition about these things a bonus is that you will be able to skim through mathematics resources much faster."

Othertimes it&#x27;s a totally customized bespoke setup that tracks things down to individual clicks on every page (a good flag that the client is on its last legs).<p>Similarly, for those sites, I have a collection of Python scripts that translate between CSV and the standardized XML imports that the ecommerce platform uses (SFCC).

haven&#x27;t spent enough time on the problem or just read the solution which made you feel this way, not realizing that the solution was done by a person that could have spent 100x the time you spent on it and built the intuition you&#x27;re asking about."

So the moving of any file on or off the computer is logged and monitored, but keystrokes are not.  So doesn&#x27;t take a keystroke logger.  When I ran IT and development for a medical company we installed network based file detection so we could also see if people were moving more data or data that matched certain patterns around on the network.  This let us take those logs and tie them to computers and people and see if it was authorized.  We also had software on all the computers that monitored files on&#x2F;off and blocked USB and CD&#x2F;DVD drives.

2019-08-27,"Reusable components of any nontrivial complexity are, for the most part, a pipedream. Unless you have a dedicated team maintaining and extending them, it immediately becomes more of a hassle than anything. Documentation is slim, edge cases aren&#x27;t completely thought through, and configuration is never sufficient. Visual design patterns can absolutely be standardized. But the actual implementation as we all know changes ever so slightly from project to project in ways that can almost never be forseen. I&#x27;m all for component driven UI architectures, but the idea of being able to reuse anything complex between projects and teams has never really worked out in my experience unless it is a highly active open source project, or something you built yourself and fully understand."

If someone writes something you disagree with, you can challenge it, though the finer tuned debate functionality around counterarguments are coming a bit later, we have a lot for what we are calling our beta.<p>We&#x27;re still pretty early and are in the process of building out a lot of features and functions, but would love to have you join and give us feedback on what you think of the platform as we evolve! So far the community we&#x27;ve developed around productive debating has been awesome and they love the product given where it currently is in the roadmap. Everyone is open to learning from one another. If you want, you can email me: expherience@gmail.com and we can get you plugged into our Slack community!<p>Website: beta.trustory.io"

Finding one and figuring out how to tie to short term incentives  creating a positive feedback loop would be a real game changer.

2019-08-27,"We are a commercial agricultural producer using polyhouses in southern India; we have couple of playhouses so I am well aware of the nuances.<p>polyhouses and any other associated with these like vertical farm,hydrophonics etc are firstly suited for specific set of plants.<p>Not all plants and veggies can be grown , some plants cannot be grown inside polyhouses at all, i would say almost 70 % of veggies which are mass consumed can never be grown in polyhouses,hydrophonics etc.<p>Just think of all the veggies you had today or yesterday and you will easily understand these cannot be grown in polyhouses let alone hydrophonics.<p>there is no doubt significant increase in production, compared to outdoor farming. These are because of various factors. The main factors are we allow the plant to grow suitably thereby maximizing required production.<p>For example in a capsicum polyhouse, there are nets which help the plant to climb, and almost everything is supplied to the plant on more than required basis.<p>The capsicum plant is allowed minimal leaves so that max nutrition is allowed for the capsicum alone and not for the plant leaves etc. You can think of it it like a kid with a silver spoon, these plants get everything in return for capsisum and  capsicum alone. ( who cares abt capsicum leaves BTW )<p>Secondly The price of capsicum is not determined by the buyer nor the producer , its determined by some trader who is totally unknown. This unknown person gets to decide on the price.<p>You the end customer nor the farmer has any say in determining the price. This is especially difficult when the output is perishable. The farmer has to sell it at whatever the price which is offered or else his produce will rot. When you grow a bumper crop its all the more difficult to find that many no of traders , transport etc. Selling 1 Ton itself is difficult enough, imagine the complexity when you have 10 tons from the same farm. You would need more resources to manage everything. The trader will never offer the same rate as he would have offered for 1 ton since he knows very well that you would never be able to sell 10 tons.<p>No country has the ways and means to distribute all the produce effectively across to its citizens.<p>The problems with polyhouses compound when other methods are introduced ( think hydrophonics,aerophonics,vertical farming etc), There is no economics involved in these.<p>Unless you do it as a passion. its never profitable to grow brocolli or lettuice in hydrophonics. The trader will never give you the right price if you have an huge quantity.<p>Its very easy to say brocolli sells for $X and we can do this and that and reduce it by $y in reality no one can control every aspect of the food chain.<p>Isreal does it becuase of its limited land availabilty , not with the case of India ,china and USA.<p>I am not sure if I had explained the whole correctly but Hydroponics + etc  is only a hobby never commercially viable."

2019-08-27,"Yes, there is just so much, and it is not thoroughly documented. &quot;BPF maps&quot; in particular are a) a special feature of a special feature that&#x27;s Linux-specific, not anything that generalizes across OSes, and b) a feature for userspace anyway, not for kernel internals. But even longstanding kernel-internal features aren&#x27;t well documented (e.g., the other day I was trying to figure out what struct file&#x27;s f_version does, and I think there&#x27;s genuinely no docs for it.) So honestly I think the answer there is to not feel bad about not knowing everything.<p>The basic trick of dealing with the kernel is becoming comfortable working in a large codebase most of which you don&#x27;t understand, and figuring out how to find what you need. Honestly, git grep is one of the best tools here. Get some practice finding some specific thing and where it&#x27;s implemented, e.g., find a syscall (git grep SYSCALL.*foo) and trace what it calls. Find the definition of a structure inside include&#x2F; and see who uses it. Get comfortable with the kernel&#x27;s OO-ish system of operations structs, and get some practice tracing both &quot;this function makes a generic call, here&#x27;s a sample driver that implements it&quot; and &quot;this is an implementation of a generic function, here&#x27;s the syscall that calls it.&quot;<p>Beyond that, reading <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lwn.net"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lwn.net</a> &#x27;s articles is invaluable, partly for the clear prose coverage and partly for the breadth of what they talk about. (You don&#x27;t need to pay unless you care strongly about this week&#x27;s updates - you&#x27;ll learn plenty from reading articles a week behind - but support them if you can, they&#x27;re an important resource.) Again, you&#x27;re not going to follow exactly why e.g. Google wants a new syscall for &quot;restartable sequences&quot; on your first read, but you&#x27;ll get a sense of what is involved in adding a syscall, how various concurrency models work, what other kernel features are relevant, etc.<p>What sort of OS concepts are you finding yourself Googling? I will say that actually doing a college OS class is what made things like virtual memory management click in my head. It&#x27;s an intensive approach but writing code in a much smaller kernel than Linux is a valuable way to understand concepts without being drowned in real-world optimizations and edge cases and portability."

2019-08-27,"For learning the basics about how an operating system works, I recommend Remzi and Andrea Arpaci-Dusseau&#x27;s &quot;Three Easy Pieces&quot;, which is freely available at <a href=""http:&#x2F;&#x2F;pages.cs.wisc.edu&#x2F;~remzi&#x2F;OSTEP&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;pages.cs.wisc.edu&#x2F;~remzi&#x2F;OSTEP&#x2F;</a>.  Both Remzi and Andrea Arpaci-Dusseau are great writers and are prolific researchers in the areas of operating systems and file systems, and their work is top-notch.<p>For learning the basics about how the kernels of Unix-like systems are designed, I recommend the following books:<p>-  The Design of the UNIX Operating System (1986) by Maurice Bach.  You could also compare this book to the source code of Version 7 Unix, which is freely available under a BSD-style license.  Many of the basic design principles of Unix-like operating systems have not changed dramatically over the years, and so studying the design and implementation of older, smaller implementations of Unix-like operating systems can aid with figuring out the code base of Linux, which is huge.<p>-  UNIX Internals: The New Frontier (1996) by Uresh Vahalia.  This discusses some more modern features that weren&#x27;t part of AT&amp;T Unix.<p>-  The Design and Implementation of the FreeBSD Operating System (2014) by Marshall Kirk McKusick et al.  I&#x27;ve met &quot;Kirk&quot; in person a few times at USENIX FAST conferences; he&#x27;s not only a great writer, but he is also very friendly and approachable.  This is a well-written text describing FreeBSD 11, including modern features such as ZFS.<p>There are some good Linux kernel books (I&#x27;m partial to &quot;Linux Kernel Development&quot; by Robert Love, which helped me out nine years ago when I was writing a device-mapper device), but what I&#x27;ve found during my experience working with the Linux kernel is that the Linux kernel changes much faster than the books describing it get updated.  Nevertheless, the best thing to do is to get a solid understanding of how Unix works, then get a basic understanding of the Linux kernel, then start diving into the source code, which is ultimately the definitive documentation of the Linux kernel.<p>When I was working on that device-mapper device, I found that perusing the Linux kernel mailing list was excellent for learning about how relevant portions of the kernel changed over time.<p>Good luck and have fun!  I haven&#x27;t done much kernel-level work lately, but I miss working at that level!"

2019-08-27,"A lot of intuition in math is from geometry.  High school plane geometry is a good start, but high school solid geometry, where get good tools and intuition for seeing things in 3D instead of just the 2D of plane geometry, is quite a bit better.<p>Another part of intuition is from Max Zorn (from Zorn&#x27;s lemma statement of the axiom of choice):<p>&quot;Be wise, generalize.&quot;<p>E.g., for the set of real numbers R and a positive integer n, a lot that goes on in the n-dimensional vector space R^n is a <i>generalization</i> of what can see in 3D, e.g., from solid geometry.<p>E.g., in both cases, a biggie is a perpendicular (<i>orthogonal</i>) projection and, again, the Pythagorean theorem.  E.g., regression in statistics is a perpendicular projection.<p>Perpendicular (orthogonality) is a biggie and is a major part of, say, Fourier series.  I.e., each of the sine&#x2F;cosine waves used is an orthogonal axis, and to find the corresponding Fourier series coefficient just project onto that axis.  The projection is an integral of a product, and that is commonly an <i>inner product</i> which close to just a cosine of an angle as in plane and solid geometry and a perpendicular projection and close to correlation in statistics, etc.<p>E.g., a huge fraction of applied math is from <i>analysis</i> in pure math, and from G. F. Simmons the two pillars of analysis are &quot;continuity and linearity&quot;.  Linearity generalizes enormously:  The quantum mechanics <i>super position</i> is essentially linearity.  Under meager assumptions, differentiation and integration in calculus are linear <i>operators</i>.  In probability theory, expectation is a linear operator.  The wave equation is a linear partial differential equation.  Linear programming works on linear equations.    Of course, in <i>linear</i> algebra, matrix multiplication is a linear operator. When something is not linear, it may be <i>locally</i> linear which can be enough to get useful results.<p>For more, a good lesson is to <i>approximate</i>:  Commonly we can&#x27;t get just what we want in just one step but can <i>iterate</i> and <i>approximate</i> as closely as we please.  So, can use simple things, sine waves, polynomials, continuous functions, and more, as means of approximation.  Such approximation gets us close to more in <i>continuity</i> and, in particular, <i>completeness</i> -- the real numbers are <i>complete</i> and the rational numbers are not but via iteration can approximate the reals as closely as we please.  Then this generalizes:  The big point about Hilbert space (as mathematicians but not always physicists define it) is completeness.  A joke, partly correct, is that &quot;calculus is the elementary consequences of the completeness property of the real number system&quot;.  E.g., the integral in calculus (and its better version in measure theory) is defined in terms of an iterative approximation.  So, if you are good with sine waves, polynomials, continuous functions, wavelets, and more, then you can iterate and approximate a lot, in many cases, everything there is in that case."
2019-08-27,"Short-haul and medium-haul and long-haul conventional take-off electric aircraft.<p>There&#x27;s a lot of work on VTOL electric aircraft and hybrid aircraft. There&#x27;s a lot of capturing low-hanging fruit by trying to electrify existing airframes. On the higher end, there&#x27;s a lot of work on enabling lithium-air or lithium-sulfur or solid state lithium or metal electrode lithium ion batteries. However, there&#x27;s not a lot of work on combining extremely high efficiency airframes (i.e. glider-like) with extremely high performance batteries (and high battery mass fraction, i.e. 60%, not 25%). Often one or the other is the focus, but a combination is essential to enable decent range (1000km) with existing batteries and long-haul range (at 4000-10,000km) with advanced chemistries (lithium air).<p>Another issue is low capital cost hydrogen production. There has been a lot of work on reducing the cost-per-watt of solar and wind power and fuel cells, but progress on cost-per-watt on hydrogen production (i.e. electrolysis) has been lacking. That means it&#x27;s not financially viable to produce hydrogen from excess intermittent renewable energy, in spite of the clear potential (if the cost-per-watt of your electrolysis equipment is much higher than the cost-per-watt of wind or solar, you need to run near constantly to make your capital investment make sense... hydrogen doesn&#x27;t work as a flexible demand source if the capital cost is so high the plant has to run all the time).<p>Microbiome modification to reduce methane emissions from ruminants (cows and sheep and goats).<p>Liquid hydrogen powered container ships or long-haul aircraft (and a method of dealing with the water emissions so as not to release water vapor at high altitudes).<p>High efficiency deep cryogenic liquefaction of hydrogen.<p>Battery-electric long haul locomotives (perhaps with intermittent charging via catenary).<p>Extremely cheap Level 1 or 2 electric charging outlets.

2019-08-27,"(US East Coast)<p>1. Recruiters are scraping the same job boards applicants use.<p>2. Salary Surveys are always wrong, and many go underpaid because they don&#x27;t know how to negotiate.<p>3. Companies write contracts poorly, with little consideration for things that keep employees engaged and on a contract.<p>4. There are way too many technology stacks, too many people focus on saying theirs is the best rather than accurately evaluating solutions based on available skills and right fit to the business need.<p>5. Way too many inexperienced and untrained people in management positions. I can&#x27;t tell you how often I&#x27;ve heard IT managers say that they&#x27;re &quot;Not really a technical person&quot;. Stop hiring your unqualified friends.<p>6. Government has no idea about tech either. They need to be educated in order to protect consumers, employees, and the economy from bad tech.<p>7. Not enough consumer protection enforcement. When companies do bad things the consequences should set an example for everyone else, not just be 10% of the profit as a penalty.<p>8. Employees need better vacation, and more options for flexible work days. 40 hour weeks are a lot, the standard for industry leave is usually 15 days a year now. The entire stat of Virginia has an &quot;At Will&quot; employment policy. No wonder why really productive projects suffer from attrition and buron out. You only get out of that trap if you have the power to negotiate, but companies need to create better policies and stick to them for all employees.<p>9. Recruiters need to educate themselves on technology. Stop lying to candidates about positions, you should know the difference between Angular and Python. You should also always be up front about where the work location is, and stop sending me text messages you vultures... Email works just fine."

In this case the fact that the employee is planning to pick up a side gig is a good indicator they are a genuine contractor instead of a disguised employee. Similarly it helps if the worker provides their own equipment and has responsibility for their own working hours.<p>(2) Do not offer health and other benefits directly or via an allowance as this is the act of an employer. 
(3) Instead build them into the total salary e.g. increase salary by 5k.<p>Lastly if engaging as a contractor make sure it is for a fixed term (e.g. 6-12 months). Towards the end of the contract initial duration both parties can assess whether the setup still works or whether an employed solution might be more appropriate.<p>This article might be helpful:

2019-08-26,Developer roles are so much better setup to work well in an remote environment. The built in task list organization helps people not only stay on track but demonstrate their output regardless if they&#x27;re on site or remote.<p>The problem is many non-engineering related roles follow similar organization around sprints and backlogs&#x2F;task lists. Because of that I think there&#x27;s a natural suspicion around productivity for people you don&#x27;t get a chance to see everyday.<p>In other words work organization still sucks for non-engineering related remote work (sales excluded actually).<p>And then internal relationship building i think is also a challenge which impacts collaboration 100% - that still sucks.

Each local government has different quality standards but all are supposed to meet the federal guidance as a bare minimum.  Depending on their source of water too they may add different minerals or chemicals to treat the water.   Yes, the U.S. has had stupidity like Flint, but I&#x27;d call that an exception to what is otherwise quite a safe system as a whole.<p>Is R&#x2F;O better?  Depends on your definition of better, but R&#x2F;O is obviously very clean and safe to drink, although I have heard some people say they don&#x27;t like the taste or &quot;how&quot; it feels.  R&#x2F;O removes a lot of the minerals so it does taste different for sure.  Some people can&#x27;t stand their water to be hard and some don&#x27;t like soft water, so I think that is preference for many people."

I would be eager to have another remote contract but my very large employer definitely isn&#x27;t coughing one up anytime soon.<p>1) Stable, fast internet for endless video-chats<p>2) Visa&#x2F;bank account issues.<p>3) Company politics.<p>These 3 things can make working remote a challenge. Video chats are needed to simulate &quot;in person conversations&quot; which company executives believe improves efficiency and morale. Companies are also worried about &quot;how do we legally pay our employees if they claim to be in the USA but are really on a tourist visa somewhere&quot;. And third, companies will often has gossip and politics and power struggles where those who are in office have more face time and promotion potential than those who are remote.<p>All of these things can be easily fixed but it requires the employee and the employer to not be incompetent."

Then bought a Lenovo X1C6 as soon as it was announced last year and I&#x27;m very happy with it: super solid and no issues with any component.<p>I also bought a Librem 13 because I wanted a free laptop and because why I love the X1C6 as a machine, I&#x27;m not willing to trust Lenovo 100% as far as ethics go. The Librem is a beautiful machine and works really well, however I&#x27;m not willing to use it as my main driver because it doesn&#x27;t have USB-C charging.

2019-08-26,"I&#x27;ve found that repeated practice and building the habit was very helpful for longer term goals like learning.<p>One thing I&#x27;ve done is explicitly blocked time to work on learning.  For example, when I jumped in to learn some UX&#x2F;Sketch work for a previous company (very small, no designated designers), I would block off an hour that would be specifically for that work. No email, no slack, no code review, just two 25-minute chunks of learning with a break in-between. I would also usually come in a little early and knock it out first thing in the morning, since a) that was the time when there were the fewest distractions and b) then I could check it off my TODO list and not have to worry about it for the rest of the day.<p>More recently, at a larger company with more meetings, I&#x27;ve found that explicitly blocking time&#x2F;space to work on something can be really helpful for heads-down learning.<p>Side note: I&#x27;ve also found that having the goal of sharing with my team (via informal tech talks) is a tremendous way to learn and to stay diligent."

I write my reply, then go get a cup of coffee or take a bathroom break or whatever. Then when I come back, I ask myself whether the world would be better off if I closed the browser tab instead of posting.<p>2. Always add, don&#x27;t subtract. If I don&#x27;t have something substantive to contribute that hasn&#x27;t already been said, and I just want to cut the legs out from under an existing comment, it&#x27;s probably not worth the time and emotional energy and it won&#x27;t convince anyone anyway.<p>3. Talk about the ideas. Don&#x27;t make the response personal unless the person I&#x27;m responding to specifically asked for a personal response (asking for advice on a situation they&#x27;re in, etc.) If I find myself writing the word &quot;you,&quot; it&#x27;s a sign that I may be violating this rule."

Battery SOC and last-seen stats aren&#x27;t completely harmless.<p>2. Maybe this will be clearer when you release docs on the SDK - do you provide interfaces for normal logging in addition to just crash logging? <i>Ideally</i>, firmware applications should never crash, but unexpected logic states or invalid user input happen all the time.<p>3. How are you expecting licensing to work? Per device? Monthly subscription fee? Flat fee software purchase?<p>4.

I use my laptop 7 x 14 on dev and it travels with me everywhere so no time to return for something that should not be an issue at time of purchase.<p>I purchased Lenovo P72 8GB &#x2F; 256GB SSD 17&quot; with 3 year warranty extension, like AppleCare, and have upped the RAM to 64GB (it is 128GB capable when the RAM becomes more affordable), added 1TB Samsung SSD and an internal 7mm 2TB drive.  If SSDs fail, tends to be binary while a drive tends to fail over time (by sector &#x2F; track) which the drive manages, so better for online backup.<p>Have installed VMware workstation 15 allowing a win &#x2F; Linux dev environment and multiple Linux flavor installs.  Since I still have two other macs, I have installed MACOSX on a VMware VM as well, using my existing appleID.  Runs like a dream and can develop without being online.<p>I also install various flavors of windows to resolve subscriber issues where it relates to their OS.<p>If you buy the same machine and need to upgrade RAM under the keyboard, ignore the need for a keyboard removal tool.

But there are also internships that honestly are fairly sloppy and you need to really seek out your own path and push to learn.  To be fair, I&#x27;d give it a week to see what shakes out but I would be asking basic questions, just so you stay in the front of peoples minds.  In the U.S. I have seen a few startups structure internships to see which of the intern(s) will actively seek out work etc.  I frankly think this is a huge mistake, but I don&#x27;t think they are doing it to be mean, just they themselves are inexperienced and think this is a valid way to see who will make themselves valuable to the company.<p>My advice, make yourself valuable to the company and make the most of your time there, even if in the end it winds up not being a good company you will learn a lot and people will see value in you which  may lead to good recommendations later to other companies&#x2F;programs.  If you just sit back and take it easy then you&#x27;ll learn very little and people won&#x27;t respect you in the end (generally)."

Again, I did a quick search but couldn&#x27;t find the one I had in mind.<p>My preference is python, so naturally I looked there first. I can&#x27;t remember what happened to pelican, why I didn&#x27;t go for it. Nikola seemed nice until I started reading the documentation. I also looked at some that were further down static gens list. But something was missing.<p>Jekyll has great documentation, but there are a lot of moving pieces. You can make it into a full fledge website that has a blog, or make it into a blog - quite easily. It seems that whoever states that Jekyll is geared towards creating a blog..... who knows why?!<p>Played around with Hugo last year and meh...<p>Now, I don&#x27;t know how much looking into different ssg influenced the ease it was to pick up eleventy, but it just made sense. It&#x27;s a bare bones static site generator that - just works. There are several blog posts that will get you up and running quickly. There are several skeleton GitHub repos, some use tailwindCSS, some have netlify Cms already configured, some are plain. Or you can just build your own.<p>Another I picked it, which is on a personal level. Since it&#x27;s such a well structured, bare-bone project, its helping me learn&#x2F;practice JavaScript and it&#x27;s ecosystem. npm scripts is all you need.<p>All the other tools, gatsby, etc - are great if you already understand react. And even if you don&#x27;t but are interested - I got the impression (gatsby at least) that it&#x27;s documentation was good and you could learn a great deal about react going through it. Maybe, I don&#x27;t know.<p>Finally... I feel that some projects could do with an overhaul, at least with their documentation. Some parts felt like an afterthought instead of one cohesive, linear explanation. Not an easy task in the least, but what is?<p>But more importantly, pick one thing and stick to it (unless it proves to be hindering productivity)."

2019-08-26,"This was part of the master plan and roadmap for Java for a long time now. This should not be a surprise or cause any outrage.  The roadmap was:<p>1.  Oracle starts to relicense as open source most parts of the JVM, spinning off OpenJDK in the process.<p>2.  Oracle provides support, patches, community and endeavors to help get OpenJDK self-sustaining.<p>3.  Once OpenJDK is maintained by the open source community and generally healthy, Oracle starts working on proprietary value-add additions that can benefit their customer base (and bank accounts).<p>We&#x27;re entering phase 3.  Oracle, beyond what you might think of them, has done a pretty decent job of following the overall plan. They have helped get the OpenJDK community off the ground and are still invested in its success.<p>Without doing the above, there was real risk that Java would succumb to other more open platforms or be splintered off by companies like IBM, Redhat, etc.  Instead, the above plan allowed for Oracle to keep the core of Java in one piece, conceding that other companies would help with its evolution, and still reserve their ability to make a buck later.<p>It&#x27;s a little shaky right now with all the hubbub about Oracle&#x27;s licensing of the Oracle JVM.  The messaging could have possibly been better.  But if you haven&#x27;t been aware of the OpenJDK and following along with it - if your sole source of all things Java has been Oracle - then it&#x27;s definitely time for a wake up call.<p>Oracle is now a member of the Java community, not necessarily the driver."

2019-08-26,"I am at a Fortune 500 co. and they require OpenJDK only and I&#x27;m sure that has to do with positioning the company for upcoming licensing fees from Oracle.  Thing is, if push comes to shove we could just migrate off of Java completely because with containerization, do we really even care about the JVM?  We get excellent portability via Docker containers now.  Modern CI&#x2F;CD and containerization can easily kill Java, having Oracle start charging would just be the final nail.

2019-08-26,"There isn&#x27;t 1 type of protester. They are spread over a spectrum, from those who are totally peaceful, to the extreme end who are advocating violence against they &quot;system&quot;.
They also don;t have all the same demands, although they are generally in agreement of the 5 demands, however because this is a &quot;leader-less&quot; protest, it is hard to say which of those demands are of higher priority than others, i suspect the different factions of protests will have higher priority over certain ones.. e.g. front line protesters would probably value exoneration higher than the peaceful protesters.<p>But generally speaking, they come from all walks of life... There are now beginning to be more vocal anti-protest groups as well. So it&#x27;s becoming increasingly a battle for public opinion. Whilst the front-line protesters have general public support, they will feel they have a mandate to continue what they are doing so propaganda machines from both sides are in full effect to try to win over public opinion."

I&#x27;m not sure about plugins (I haven&#x27;t used WP in a long time,) but you can set the core Wordpress updates to be automatic. It will handle everything you need.<p>If after a week of coding you arrive to the weekend and think &quot;I want to do a bunch more coding&quot; then you go with a static site generator. Then you don&#x27;t finish over the weekend and have to screw with it the following weekend as well. Then you finally publish the thing with &quot;good enough but not quite what you wanted&quot; functionality and let it sit there for weeks. Then you come back to it and scratch your head trying to remember how to publish &#x2F; build &#x2F; deploy it (or you cycle through your shell history hoping the commands are still in there.) One day you decide that you want to add that functionality you left out the first time and find that you have to relearn everything you had to learn to build the thing in the first place. Sure, you vaguely remember the easy stuff, but you have to refresh on the easy stuff to get back to the harder stuff which you never had time to figure out from the beginning.<p>Anyone been there? ;) In this case, I&#x27;m thinking of Hugo, but I imagine it&#x27;s much the same for all the others.<p>With Wordpress you get enough balance of customization and ease of use that you can just get on with it. If you need a bit of help, then get on Fiverr or similar and have someone throw you pointers (or just do it for you) to save you time in getting past tricky parts.<p>There&#x27;s a reason loads of sites on the internet are using WP.

2019-08-26,"I have dealt with remote issues both as a founder (since ~2003) and for the last few years as an employee for a startup.  There are differences in expectations depending on the size of the startup and the funding etc.  But I&#x27;ll assume a very early startup with minimal funding.<p>1. Hire as a Contractor.  An international employee adds significant difficulties to your company in terms of tax compliance and wages, even an employee in another state can increase costs, reporting and compliance.  You should also pay slightly more to the contractor because the contractor is also accepting tax liability when you do this. However that is easily acceptable because it will still be far cheaper than if you tried to setup an employee relationship, especially in another Country.<p>2. Benefits for contractors are usually very few if any, but in the case you want&#x2F;need to provide health care; I would suggest you provide a slightly higher pay and have Joanne source health care locally.  Not quite sure for Canada as they also have nationalized healthcare so you&#x27;d have to research the expense there some.  But IMO, it is always good to provide some small addition to cover local health care.  In the U.S. it is not uncommon to have them pick up a local plan and the company pays for it, or at least a portion of it ($200-500&#x2F;month is fairly common for single people depending on health, age and plan details).<p>3. As I suggest you hire as a contractor any&#x2F;all benefits should be spelled out in the contract.  Your standard equity agreement can be used likely but I&#x27;d check with an attorney real quick to see if you should also put it in the agreement.  As a contractor I&#x27;d want it in the agreement as well, just so it was clear.  Essentially I&#x27;d want a basic statement that says XYZ is being offered 2% equity as defined in the &quot;equity contract document title&quot;.<p>4. You should also be very specific in your contracting agreement about the relationship, there are some very specific rules the IRS uses to determine if you are just misclassifying someone to avoid paying taxes.  <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.irs.gov&#x2F;newsroom&#x2F;understanding-employee-vs-contractor-designation"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.irs.gov&#x2F;newsroom&#x2F;understanding-employee-vs-contr...</a> is a good start to see what they look at.   The fact the person is in another Country is in your favor here where you could likely violate some of the guidance and still be on safe grounds for classification as a contractor (an attorney is best to answer in specific)."

2019-08-26,"I use both, WordPress and Hugo.<p>I use WordPress for personal blog, which consist mostly of links, highlights from books, photography, and stream of concise writing.<p>And I use Hugo for my professional website with a few blog posts but it is mostly focused on resume.<p>WordPress makes it super easy to share content via its app or bookmarklet on computer. Writing experience on WordPress editor is okay. I get average of 100 visitors per month but don&#x27;t get any comments. I leave comments turned on because if I want to add a note when using someone else&#x27;s machine, I can. Otherwise, I would turn off commenting and reduce one risk vector.<p>For Hugo, I use dedicated writing app, iaWriter[0]. It is definitely better experience of writing. My Hugo blog also has a private area where I write my fiction projects or write private notes. Of course, Hugo has no comments or search. Not really important for me. You can easily modify Hugo template to your liking but stuff like scheduled posts, automatic sharing on social networks, related posts, etc is not easily doable.<p>Based on the fact that you want to focus on writing, I would suggest Hugo with a good writing app. Of course, you can write blog posts in any editor and copy paste into WordPress or wherever.<p>[0]: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ia.net&#x2F;writer"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ia.net&#x2F;writer</a>"

Today, the biggest value of gmail for me is its spam filter. similarly, I immediately switched from yahoo to google when google came out, but it wasn&#x27;t because I felt google&#x27;s results were more relevant. I have never compared the results. it was because google&#x27;s ui was very clean and fast. I also couldn&#x27;t understand the value of dropbox given box.com, but again, I registered for the free storage.<p>I think the intention of the &quot;find a problem&quot; suggestion is to avoid no demand, but I too think it might be too conservative and I can&#x27;t map many successful startups to it well, like instagram, Minecraft and twitter. And I doubt their founders thought about solving a problem when they started their project.<p>A while back, I read on HN an article saying that there are 2 types of good ideas, one solves a problem, the other creates new opportunities. I kinda agree. Imagine we went back to an ancient time and asked people if they need anything like TV for entertainment, I guess the answer would be no, because TV hadn&#x27;t been part of their life. Without it, they had other forms of entertainment to kill the time. If we went to 1900 and asked if people need personal cars. They would probably say no because their work and social network were local. But personal cars enabled new opportunities, people can now commute farther for better job and extend their network.<p>I guess if someone asks us today if we have a problem with not being able to do space travel. We would say no. But future people may think otherwise."

Or better yet, always make your tests run in a minute or two.<p>What we used at my previous startup was a CI pipeline per microservice with stages for build&#x2F;test, staging test&#x2F;deploy of service, journey test in staging fully deployed, prod test&#x2F;deploy of service, and journey test in prod fully deployed.<p>A journey test is the top 10 or so things that a user should be able to do (e.g. sign-up, do a primary thing, do another core thing, get a notification, tell a friend to sign-up). No matter how bad a deploy is, if the journey test passes, at least you know that&#x27;s it&#x27;s not <i>that</i> bad, or if it fails you know it right away. One downside is that it runs <i>after</i> deployment so it&#x27;s a live issue. (Checking pre-deploy is a false sense of security.)"

From an employee standpoint, the factors that make options more valuable than they seem can cause equity to be worth tens of percent more than a naive calculation. The factors that make options less valuable than they seem do so in ways that mostly aren’t easy to quantify.<p>Whether or not the factors that make options relatively more valuable dominate or the factors that make options relatively less valuable dominate is an empirical question. My intuition is that the factors that make options relatively less valuable are stronger, but that’s just a guess. A way to get an idea about this from public data would be to go through through successful startup S-1 filing. Since this post is already ~5k words, I’ll leave that for another post, but I’ll note that in my preliminary skim of a handful of 99%-ile exits (&gt; $1B), the median employee seems to do worse than someone who’s on the standard Facebook&#x2F;Google&#x2F;Amazon career trajectory.<p>From a company standpoint, there are a couple factors that allow companies to retain more leverage&#x2F;control by giving relatively more options to employees and relatively less equity to investors.<p>All of this sounds fine for founders and investors, but I don’t see what’s in it for employees."

2019-08-25,"Over years and years of arguing online, I started to notice that few people change their minds.  For most, argument is a sort of self-confirming rehearsal.  You&#x27;re being challenged to see if your articulation holds up to their assault, not to see if their position agrees with yours.<p>It became frustrating to witness this because, in part, the same arguments kept getting repeated.  The same debunked points, the same rhetorical tactics, the same back-and-forth got boring to read and I started to feel like we were unable to solve or advance anything.<p>So I started not participating, but kept reading.  I&#x27;d still see interesting information or links or citations.  Lurking was still fun.  And a funny thing happened: once I stopped participating, I became much more empathetic.  I didn&#x27;t agree with others more, but I felt much more to understand their points and their perspectives as &quot;I could agree with this under these circumstances&quot;.<p>Nowadays I participate only to clearly rebut false information, to expand on something I agree with, or to inject good data.

2019-08-25,"In the last few months, one really fun and educational side project has been creating&#x2F;designing my own programming language.<p>It started by accident, by taking apart an existing mathematical expression evaluator, to learn how it works. This led to a deeper understanding of lexer&#x2F;parser&#x2F;interpreter, (pre&#x2F;in&#x2F;post)fix notations, stack machines..<p>Once I realized that what I was looking at was a kind of &quot;virtual machine&quot;, I was hooked and continued by adding language features like variables, arrays, objects&#x2F;dictionaries, functions.<p>The basics are now fairly complete, but the language doesn&#x27;t &quot;do anything&quot; yet - it&#x27;s in its own small isolated universe. Next I&#x27;m imagining how it will safely interface with the outside world - networking, file system, database, vector graphics, sounds.. What I want is something like a cross between BASIC, Lisp, and Hypercard.<p>Anyway, still not sure how practical it&#x27;s going to be, but it&#x27;s been a wonderful learning experience. It led me down through the history of computer science to re&#x2F;learn the basics, making numerous discoveries of things I didn&#x27;t know, getting a better overview of what languages exist(ed), what I like (or not) about their syntax or approaches to various aspects of programming. Creating this little hobby language has definitely helped me grow as a programmer.<p>---<p>As for a non-tech related subject, studying music theory is endlessly fun and thought-provoking.

2019-08-25,"I started to learn machine learning relatively seriously. But I&#x27;ve always had issues with frameworks where the team goes out of their way to be clever rather than straightforward. ML frameworks to me are plagued with that. And I hate python. A lot. Mostly because of white space formatting.<p>So, I decided to make my own neural net in C#. For fun, it&#x27;ll never be released. I spent a solid month learning anything and everything I could about how brains work in the animal kingdom. Then I built out a neural net according to what I learned. My cells aren&#x27;t really similar to most of the conventional types out there. But it does work fairly well with numerical data. If I spent more time, like a solid year instead of spare time over 2 months, I think it could be respectable.<p>What I really learned from this project was optimization to the extreme. I spent a hell of a lot of time testing different ways to accomplish the same math and pull out as much performance as possible. I&#x27;d guess for every hour of code, I spent 4 or 5 hours research, testing and optimizing. Mostly because it&#x27;s all CPU instead of GPU. I never got into cuda and I never will. It&#x27;s not like I&#x27;ve never optimized before. The difference now, I spent time finding out if conventional wisdom was correct. Also, I discovered a bunch of methods in C# that I never knew about.<p>I dont do development anymore for work (and God willing, never will), so this was just a distraction&#x2F;curiosity project for me. In reality, I wish I took the time early on in my career to do a project like this. Anyone fresh in dev needs to do a 3 to 6 month pure optimization project learning, for themselves, what works and what doesn&#x27;t. Conventional wisdom really is only the tip of the iceberg."

2019-08-25,"I have XPS 9560 with i7-7700HQ CPU, 16GB RAM, 512GB SDD, and 1080p 15&#x27; screen. I switched from MacBook Pro 2014 Retina, the highest specs back then. I had an azerty keyboard layout that was driving me crazy. (Gosh, how I hate the stupid azerty! I always forget how to write a freaking pipe &quot;|&quot;.)<p>Windows works very well. I had issues with CPU overheating when playing Witcher 3, but I reduced the voltage on CPU a little without reducing clock with an Intel program and it succeeded in reducing temperatures without stability issues.<p>On Ubuntu (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;stockmind&#x2F;dell-xps-9560-ubuntu-respin"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;stockmind&#x2F;dell-xps-9560-ubuntu-respin</a>) there was some fun in making sure that Nvidia GPU is off during normal work in order to reduce battery usage. I can get GPU back on with single command if I need to do some simple machine learning. Right now during my normal working (Firefox with 200+ tabs, Chrome, VS Code running) with 100% battery, powertop gives me a discharge rate of 12.3 W and estimated remaining time of 7 hours, 31 minutes. It normally is about enough for a full workday.<p>The Bluetooth sometimes goes off after closing the computer (suspend) while being connected to headphones. In order to fix the issue, I need to restart the computer waiting for about 10 seconds downtime before starting again. Funny enough, right now Ubuntu is claiming that Bloototh is off but it is actually working. There are also very sporadic issues with video. For example, sometimes YouTube will just crash and I will need to restart the system to get it back working.<p>I&#x27;m happy with the build quality (beside mentioned thermal properties). I especially like the sturdy screen. Keyboard and trackpad, for me at least, are about as good as Mac. I liked Mac trackpad maybe a little bit more. IO in XPS is good. I&#x27;m certainly missing MagSafe plug (charger plug that disconnects while pulled). I should also mention that when the battery is full and I&#x27;m connected to the charger I can hear a very weak coil whine. Kind of like an HDD head working but possibly even less noisy, most time I don&#x27;t even notice. When I do notice I just disconnect it from the charger and the whine is gone.<p>I never had to deal with Dell support, so I don&#x27;t know how it looks like. But I like that a lot of technical people use XPS, so it&#x27;s easy to Google issues.<p>Overall, I would recommend XPS. (My girlfriend has one and she is happy with it.)"
2019-08-25,"Postgresql. I had learned to rely too much on ORMs and diving into SQL proper was like getting hit by gamma rays and turning into the hulk.<p>Looker. I get asked for reports frequently and with this tool I intend to cut that number down to zero, company wide.<p>Kubernetes on AWS. Bought a book, learning about it in my spare time.<p>Graphql with React Apollo for data access. It&#x27;s pretty sick. First Redux came out, but it&#x27;s verbosity was too much, I never liked it. Then Mobx came out and it works fine for me, really fun to use. Now Apollo exists and you don&#x27;t even need a store. Plus it caches stuff. Plus a bunch of other sexy stuff. Very interesting tech.<p>I read bad feedback&#x2F;stories for companies and identify trends on what went wrong, and what engineers hated so I can prevent that at Papa as head of engineering.<p>Drawing. It&#x27;s the complete opposite of programming and very soothing after a rough day. There is no right or wrong, it just `is`. I look up pictures of manga I like, from Baki or JJBA and draw stuff, then upload it on Tiktok to share in the fandom."
2019-08-25,"Most of my time this year has been with browser streaming, async Rust, and vanilla JS. I think the last has been the most useful. I highly recommend really learning the DOM. Implement your own client-side routing. Make a view framework. See if you can make an app without a bundler&#x2F;build step. Or even without npm at all. It&#x27;s fun.<p>In general, I think it&#x27;s very valuable to have a deep understanding of your platform, even if you don&#x27;t need all that information on the daily."

2019-08-25,Probably Lenovo something depending on your priorities. (I&#x27;d get a Lenovo X1 Carbon if I were replacing my X270 as I mostly prioritize lightweight.) We use Lenovos at Red Hat for our issued Linux laptops so compatibility tends to be pretty good.

2019-08-25,"My xps15 9560 has been a basketcase under ubuntu or arch linux, mostly due to the nvidia gpu never playing well with, well any other gpu.<p>In general I&#x27;d recommend avoiding anything with a &quot;hybrid&quot; gpu solution.<p>The downside is you&#x27;re stuck with a crappy intel gpu, which at high-res (4k) on my xps15 is pretty crap, so I wouldn&#x27;t get anything beyond a 1080p display with it.<p>I think life would be much better if we could disable the intel gpu in the bios to only let the system know an external solution exists, but then intel might have to admit to world+oems their gpu&#x27;s are crap to need hard-disabled."
2019-08-25,"I would probably still say Lenovo.  Although ordering on their website was the single worst eCommerce experience I ever had.<p>Mine might be a bit dated, but you might be able to find one on eBay for pretty cheap now.  I switched from an MBP 2013 to a ThinkPad T480 running Ubuntu 18.04 LTS back in July of 2018. Linux support has been really great and I didn&#x27;t have to install a lot of special drivers. (e.g. trackpad support with multi-touch scrolling worked from the start)<p>Things to love about the T480:<p>- Fairly portable at around 3.5 lbs with a 14inch screen. It avoids the dedicated numeric keypad that some larger 15inch models have, while still having good screen real estate.<p>- Great keyboard as all Thinkpads have. (media keys are working great under linux)<p>- Very durable having undergone mil-spec testing.<p>- Camera placement at top with a mechanical shutter if you get the FHD screen.<p>- 32 GB of ram if you want&#x2F;need it<p>- Hot-swappable batteries. No need to turn off the laptop. just flip it over and replace. (You can buy the extended 72Wh battery for extra battery time)"

2019-08-25,"It&#x27;s quite natural to disagree on many subjects.<p>In person, there is an unspoken rule to establish some level of trust and comfort before discussing contentious subjects. Some go so far as to suggest avoid discussing religion and politics altogether.<p>Online, the unspoken rule isn&#x27;t present and as a result, people sometimes simply state what they think and how they feel without the natural consideration for the person they&#x27;re interacting with.<p>There&#x27;s limited information to establish common ground and hence remaining neutral, constructive and polite can be difficult. The part that I enjoy is the freedom to make mistakes - especially when it comes to taboo subjects. You can mold your stance through discussion without the worry of reputation damage that always lingers in real life. One can easily squander this privilege in favor of using the internet as a place to release emotional frustration anonymously (twitter for a lot of people) and it&#x27;s good to be able to identify if that&#x27;s someone&#x27;s main drive, to avoid trying to reason with them altogether.<p>In short - being aware of the difficulty introduced by the communication medium can go a long way towards re-calibrating your expectations of yourself and others."

2019-08-25,Are the things you’re learning applicable in your current job?
2019-08-25,"I studied Philosophy in college (alongside CS).  It&#x27;s basically all about argumentation.  I do not see argumentation as anything negative, assuming the context is correct.  It is how we come to understand one another and, largely, the world.  Our intuitions, the automatic understanding that we come to from the blunt associative process in which our brain relates things, are almost always wrong in very profound ways (especially in modern society which the brains structure, which gives rise to those associative processes, did not evolve for).  Everything else comes from discussion and argument.<p>The correct context is necessary, though.  Equally as important as both participants (or more) using the same language, all participants must be interested and willing in participating.  I would recommend, if in something like a general chat environment, that you ask if they&#x27;re interested in discussing the topic.  If they&#x27;re not, then move along.  If they are, make it clear from the outset that you want to understand why they believe what they are claiming, what led them to the understanding, what they believe they gain from it, what evidence they might have, etc.  Asking questions, well made ones, can often go a long way.  But sometimes people just want to rant and aren&#x27;t in the headspace to have a sit-down real discussion.<p>There will still be times, regretfully frequent, where it will become clear that either one of the participants is engaging in bad faith or, more common, do not actually understand their own position clearly.  For many, their beliefs are accumulated like flotsam as they drift through life rather than through deliberate consideration of evidence.  Those people might benefit from hearing you speak, but not from a back-and-forth dialog.  There is very little general appreciation for finding out one is wrong.  Most people flinch away from it and take it as an insult and will interpret honest questions like &#x27;Why do you think that is?&#x27; as snide dismissal of their own positions, reading it incorrectly as an assumption that they are clearly wrong and you are just trying to figure out how they ever managed to become such an imbecile.  There can&#x27;t be any honest discussion with people in this position.  It will just devolve into them shouting no matter how calm you yourself remain.<p>There are always opportunities to engage with people honestly, for some people that takes a long time.  Often once they realize that your goal is not to make them look or feel like a fool, that your goal really is to understand a different position or even just explain your own so that it is understood even if not necessarily agreed with, most people will become more willing.  Some will only have earnest conversations with those they are familiar and close with.  As with all human interaction, it depends heavily on context.<p>I have always liked and tended towards a Socratic means of explanation (Socrates taught primarily by asking questions, getting the other person to essentially lead themselves to understand what he meant through recreating the reasoning process he himself followed) but I realized after awhile that a lot of people find this approach highly difficult to engage with.  They often see it as you &#x27;forcing&#x27; them to say things and &#x27;putting words in their mouth&#x27;.  This happens particularly with people who don&#x27;t have a reason-based basis for their beliefs but more of an emotional connection to the ideas and don&#x27;t like how saying certain things &#x27;feels&#x27; even if they can admit intellectually that they are actually true.<p>Argumentation is an art.  It probably can&#x27;t ever be made &#x27;simple&#x27;, but it is a critical part of our society and time invested in learning how to do it better through practice or study will usually be richly rewarded (at least in an intellectual and personal sense)."

When doing consulting engagements, I also ask my clients to issue a Carbon to me, and without fail they do.<p>Usable keyboard, the &quot;nub&quot;, high density screen, long battery life, small size, and light weight. I struggle to see what could be improved about it.<p>When the one I&#x27;m typing this on (my personal workhorse) kicks the bucket, it will be replaced by another X1 Carbon. The only caveat is, the 15&quot; &quot;Extreme&quot; model has an NVIDIA GPU, and that&#x27;s a PITA in Linux, since GPU switching is still an esoteric feature, so your options are either to not use the discrete GPU, or to spend hours following obscure readmes to set it up. And in the latter case it still won&#x27;t be anywhere near as good as Windows GPU switching, let alone macOS, and will likely break after a software update a few months down the road. But that&#x27;s easy to avoid: just don&#x27;t buy the 15&quot; model."

That&#x27;s good if you&#x27;re learning it to quickly use it but I&#x27;m looking to expand my mind.<p>Now I&#x27;m learning Clojure. I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll ever use it, but learning it (like people always say with Lisp) has been an experience. I&#x27;m still working through learning it and I won&#x27;t lie, it&#x27;s been challenging. Been having to remap a lot of mental models and re-thinking loops and objects.<p>I&#x27;m also learning Spacemacs. I&#x27;ve been a hardcore Vim user for nearly a decade now. I&#x27;ve tried also learning Emacs but just couldn&#x27;t get past the C-x and M-x for everything. I know it&#x27;s a tired punchline, but it&#x27;s like it was created to be anti-ergonomic. I&#x27;ve been using Spacemacs for just a couple of days and coming from Vim, it&#x27;s amazing. I&#x27;d highly recommend it to anyone that&#x27;s already very familiar with Vim. It&#x27;s got a learning curve, but after using for just a couple of days I feel I&#x27;m already coming out on the other side of that curve.<p>In non-tech, I just bought a house and have been learning gardening. Nothing serious and in fact intentionally NOT taking it too seriously and not over-planning. I&#x27;ve already grown my own carrots, peas, radishes, and even some pretty flowers for my wife. It&#x27;s been incredibly satisfying to make dinner and look at half my plate and say, I grew that.<p>I&#x27;ve even had some failures but you just stir it into the dirt and keep on.<p>I know it&#x27;s not tech, but having a hobby that isn&#x27;t in front of a screen nor sitting down has been great.

It adds some redundancy to the information so it&#x27;s easier to recover the message when transferred over a noisy channel, since at least for simple sentences you could even omit all articles in either language and still understand. For German that leads to trouble as soon as you make use of its rather flexible grammar (i.e. SVO vs OVS).<p>Speaking of weird CS analogies: you could say that tonal languages like Chinese use QAM for higher information density while we only use FM. :-)"

2019-08-25,"One point of view that might help is considering cases as being an alternative to prepositions. English has three cases - nominative, indicating the subject of a sentence; accusative, indicating the direct object; and genitive, indicating possession. Rather than using the genitive, we can also use a preposition: David&#x27;s book, or the book of David.<p>German has a fourth case for the indirect object. Where English has to use a preposition (e.g. I gave the book to him), German uses the dative case (Ich gab ihm das Buch).<p>Finnish takes the concept much further - it has fifteen cases, which can be used where English would use a preposition. For example, the abessive case is used where English would use &quot;without&quot;, the comitative for &quot;together&quot; or &quot;with&quot;.<p>So cases are not types, they are relations, indicating the role of the noun in the sentence."

I had the luxury of testing an XPS vs a Carbon in a shop in 2016 and found the XPS&#x27;s display, trackpad, and even keyboard better, certainly more Macbook-like (though Apple&#x27;s Touchpads are bigger and better). Classic Thinkpads don&#x27;t have flat trackpads, but use a somewhat special design and also have that pointer thingy (though the latest Carbon does have a flat trackpad I believe, and there&#x27;s a new Lenovo line very much like Thinkpads, but using mainstream trackpad designs and doing away with pointers).<p>Be aware that current XPS 13s have only glare screens (which would very likely be a deal breaker for me) and can&#x27;t be equipped with more than 16 GB.

The breadth and depth of skills needed to tackle projects in this field makes for some really interesting work.<p>I am currently awaiting approval to sell an editor plugin on the Unity store which I spent some free time working on as a side project. In game level design, most artists make use of &#x27;modular&#x27; assets to some extent. These are small sections of a structure e.g. a corner wall section or a roof section, which can be combined together to make endless variations on a building style. The plugin I made allows you to specify &#x27;sockets&#x27; on each modular asset, including a type and compatibility system, then it handles automatic snapping together of assets in the editor. This speeds up a assembly of modular assets significantly. The alternative, old fashioned way of doing this is &#x27;vertex snapping&#x27; which is tedious and time consuming.<p>Video here: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;MvYTbIU1d-c"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;MvYTbIU1d-c</a>"

2019-08-25,What sort of role? Local or remote?
2019-08-25,"There&#x27;s several things to keep in mind that can help. I also would prefer to approach discussion as an argument as that is the most direct way to learn and clarify your own thoughts. Unfortunately due to how people are, the situations where argumentation is actually effective for that purpose are all too rare.<p>I try to approach most online discussion from a perspective of understanding rather than trying to convince, argue, or prove something. This also directly aligns with the goal of learning, because, well, that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m trying to do.<p>The first thing it helps to realise is that every individual is at a different level of understanding. Not everyone cares that much about learning &amp; understanding, so often people are just repeating things they&#x27;ve heard and internalised. It takes work and time to &quot;unstick&quot; people who are like this from their current mindset, and for anonymous conversations on the internet, that&#x27;s never going to be worth it. You&#x27;re also unlikely to learn anything by engaging in argument as they probably don&#x27;t even know the reason themselves why they believe what they do.<p>The second thing to think is - is it worth it? What will really happen if this person continues to believe as they do? Is whatever you can potentially learn from them even worth the time? Even if you do end up continuing the discussion, asking yourself these things can help you step back and communicate from a more collaborative, flexible place.<p>As other commenters have mentioned, communicating by text on the Internet is difficult to convey exactly what you meant. No matter what you write, some people are going to misinterpret you. A lot of arguments I&#x27;ve seen happen when both parties essentially talk past each other, quoting each other&#x27;s responses but never actually engaging with each other&#x27;s points. Whether because they didn&#x27;t read the initial post carefully, or they basically understand the other person&#x27;s points but think something else is more important so argue about that instead, while the original poster thinks that&#x27;s irrelevant and continues trying to convince the replier that they&#x27;re correct. Often if you came right down to it and somehow magically gave everyone a clear, semantic understanding of the content of what the other person was saying, there would be no disagreement. But these kinds of things seem to happen a lot and cause a lot of bad feelings.<p>The other thing is that actual disagreements about verifiable facts are rare between two reasonable people, once the relevant knowledge sources have been shared. If someone is unreasonable, just don&#x27;t engage with them at all.<p>Much more often, each person has a certain context of personal experience which informs their opinion. When both people express their opinions through text, it can seem (to each other) like they&#x27;re in conflict, when in reality the different opinions are each applicable to different situations and equally valid given each person&#x27;s individual experience. This can be difficult to notice, but something to be aware of.<p>In summary, a process you might go through when reading something is:<p>1. you have a knee-jerk &quot;that&#x27;s wrong&quot; reaction. You need to stop yourself from immediately saying something in response.<p>2. Carefully read (and re-read) what they actually wrote.^1 Try to interpret it charitably - based on what they did actually write, what are they actually meaning? Usually if you&#x27;re in an argumentative mindset, you interpret things more adverserially than they actually are.<p>^1: I can&#x27;t count the number of times I&#x27;ve started writing a response, then before I submit I go back to read the post I&#x27;m responding to, and see something I missed that makes a large part of my post irrelevant and unnecessarily negative.<p>3. Try to understand where they&#x27;re coming from. If something isn&#x27;t clear, before you do anything else ask non-confrontational questions, giving them the benefit of the doubt. If you&#x27;ve got to this point, probably 90% of unpleasant arguments are already avoided.<p>4. Put forward your viewpoint and have a discussion as normal.<p>5. Apply the same charitable interpretation to every response and be willing to admit when you&#x27;re wrong. If the discussion is getting heated and feelings are potentially getting involved, de-escalate as fast as possible, even if that means admitting you&#x27;re wrong when you don&#x27;t actually believe that. (Ideally you would convey respectfully that their points have merit in some way and just leave the discussion rather than straight up lying.)<p>Throughout all this, remember that people other than the person you&#x27;re discussing with are likely reading what you write, so even if you&#x27;re failing to get through to the individual, other people may find significant value in your discussion (even if they will likely never actually reply and say so.)<p>Additionally, if you&#x27;re behaving respectfully and setting a good example while the other person is getting emotional, other people with no emotional investment will tend to take your side even if they know literally nothing about the subject matter. There&#x27;s simply no downside to making the effort to consider the other person&#x27;s emotional state and mindset because it makes the experience better for everyone."

Building your own computer have never been easier. Just buy the parts and plug them in. (and make sure there are drivers for Linux). First pick a mother-board, probably a server grade MB from Supermicro, because many HDD, controlled fan connectors, memory slots, and possible also dual CPU, and many PCI:e if you are into machine learning. Then read the manual to see known working modules. Just an example of what you can&#x27;t do on a laptop is having 6 disks in mirror&#x2F;stripe mode using ZFS. Instead of taking the computer with you, you can SSH into it, maybe use X-server to run the apps on the work machine. Just leave it on when you go home or travel, so you can run lab on it. You can give shell accounts to your jealous colleges, run the git server on it. Use it instead of &quot;cloud&quot; computing and save thousands of dollar, etc."

2019-08-25,"So you’re not trying to maximize salary but care about equity? Not sure I understand. Equity at seed stage startups is like buying lottery tickets, with the main difference that even if the startup has a successful exit 5 years later, you are not likely to get much if you are a salaried employee. Say you get $100k salary and 1% of shares, which becomes 0.1% after dilution. Say the company is bought for $1B. You will get $1M. So the total you have made after 5 years would be $1.5M. If you were working at Facebook at $300k&#x2F;year you would have earned the same amount. Only the chances of this happening at FB are close to 100%, while unicorns are called unicorns for a reason."

2019-08-25,"The name pretty much says it all: the problem comes from putting too much stress on that one part of the body. If your wrist (or some other part of the body) regularly hurts after an activity then you should:<p>1. Speak to your doctor. Listen to them over anyone else. If that isn&#x27;t available, then you can:<p>2. Ease off on the activity. Do it less. This gives your body some time to heal.<p>3. Change your environment so that the activity puts less stress on your wrist. Eg if your mouse hand&#x27;s wrist hurts due to using the mouse then you can lower you sensitivity by a lot (4x). This will force you to use your entire arm to move the mouse around instead of the wrist and will make it easier on the wrist. You could also get a vertical mouse or change keybinds around. If your keyboard hand hurts then getting a mouse with lots of programmable buttons can be helpful. Changing where your mouse and keyboard are in relation to where you sit can help (move them closer, further, higher, lower). The idea is to just change it so that other parts of the body take some of the stress.<p>4. Once you&#x27;ve healed enough, you should start exercising that part of the body slowly to make it stronger. Stretches at first and move on from there.<p>Step 3 is the easiest way to notice a big difference. I went from my mouse hand&#x27;s wrist hurting within a few hours to having no issues even after an entire day by just lowering my mouse sensitivity."

2019-08-24,"For Apple folks: Ka-Block! for Safari, both iOS and Mac, second Firefox Focus&#x27;s content blocker on iOS. Always on VPN mobile and desktop. Always Private browsing mode everywhere. Kills 99% of germs :)"
2019-08-24,"I&#x27;d recommend starting with Firefox, and configuring Firefox&#x27;s cookie settings to always block third party cookies.<p>Next, if you have a good password manager that can auto-fill logins, set Firefox to delete all cookies (and everything else) when you close the browser. That way, every time you open your browser you&#x27;re starting from a clean slate. I promise you&#x27;ll quickly get used to logging in every time, and it won&#x27;t be that hard.<p>Next, enable Firefox&#x27;s Multi-Account Containers add-on. This basically allows you to isolate sites you commonly use into their own cookie realms. Create containers for the sites you want to isolate (Google, Facebook, LinkedIn, etc.) and set those domains to always open in that domain&#x27;s container. That way, when you click on a link to Facebook it will auto open a new tab in that Facebook container.<p>Next, install uBlock Origin. I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s a need to install Privacy Badger since you&#x27;re already blocking third party cookies, but others please correct me.<p>Next, for websites that don&#x27;t work with uBlock Origin, create a dedicated container for that domain and set to always open in that container. Then, whitelist in uBlock Origin whatever tracker on that site you need to run things properly. That way, the tracker is isolated to just that domain&#x27;s container.<p>Overall, Firefox&#x27;s Multi-Account Containers are extremely powerful for isolating site cookies and trackers. I wish they would allow you to set different cookie settings per container, so you could by default clear cookies when you close Firefox and add exceptions for specific containers, but even given that deficiency, is still the most powerful browser feature that&#x27;s come out since tabs."

2019-08-24,"It might be worthwhile to research &quot;non-violent communication&quot; (NVC). There is some misinformation out there that it means not speaking clearly, but it&#x27;s actually entirely compatible with full and complete communication and understanding the viewpoint of another.<p>It&#x27;s valuable to understand different viewpoints, and also to share your own arguments - it helps people learn from each other and discover shared truths. So I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the arguing that is necessarily the problem. Arguments are simply the reasoning behind conclusions. The ugly parts of argumentation are more about style and irresponsible rhetoric.<p>(I&#x27;d also suggest that the common online format incentivizes boorishness. Most comment threads don&#x27;t make it convenient to have a full respectful sharing of views.

2019-08-24,"&gt;&quot;I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m a fit for &lt;xyz&gt; company&quot;<p>This is a really good general cop-out answer because it avoids creating hard-feelings or burning bridges if there was actually a more specific complaint (I hate working with that guy, my manager sucks, the work is super boring, product is stupid, pay sucks etc.)<p>First thing to check is, where the person is next going, are they going to be making more money? If so that is likely a reason. Another reason could be that they thought their potential for advancement at your company was low, at least in comparison to somewhere else. If the employee is an engineer, it could also be that they thought their learning had slowed or they were not working on the right kind of tech they wanted to for their career. For me, these career related reasons are the most likely reasons I would jump ship.<p>It&#x27;s important to note that you shouldn&#x27;t take a career-motivated jump personally. The only thing you can do is try to reorganize your company to make this less likely, by paying more, giving more opportunity for advancement, or working on&#x2F;with sexier tech.<p>If it&#x27;s not about career, it&#x27;s probably either interpersonal or cultural. Maybe they feel socially excluded? Maybe their manager is too distant, an asshole, or a creep? Maybe they don&#x27;t want to work as long &#x2F; the same hours as everyone else?<p>Regardless, there is a very good chance you will never get a straight answer, or will get some fake, nice excuses. This type of thing requires introspection, not an exit interview."
2019-08-24,"General advice: make sure you have a solution on all platforms. TV, IoT, phone on wifi, phone on mobile network, etc...<p>At home you need to first subvert your ISP.<p>Make sure you have a router doing blocking, like a PiHole. For mobile devices always use a VPN and DNS protection like dns-crypt. Use Cloudflare’s mobile DNS over HTTPS solution even though that’s a single point of failure, decide for yourself how risky you think that is.<p>Besides browser specific plugins you should implement a host block. The host block lists are not too exhaustive so if you use dns-crypt configure it to log every dns request and add any new hosts to your block list that look surprising.<p>It’s a lot of work, but if that’s what you’re looking for you may find some fun ways to automate this workflow :)"
2019-08-24,"For ancillary roles, sometimes they do use contractors.<p>However, for code that needs maintenance of any sort, it makes a lot more sense to bring the expertise in-house. Maybe it&#x27;s more expensive in a myopic sense, but by being able to retain an individual that already has context (not to mention, who was also probably hired with a higher hiring bar) has more gains in the long run.<p>Just think about all the companies that tried to outsource to India or China in the 90s&#x2F;00s and got bit."

A lot of it is practice and accepting that you&#x27;ll be deleting or editing comments a lot at first (suggestion: if you do either and they&#x27;ve been up for more than a few minutes, add a bit of context to the edit or deletion). Another tactic that&#x27;s helped is just writing out my response, but not pressing send for at least a minute or so. I find it usually causes me to imagine potential directions the conversation could go. Oftentimes I just end up not sending if those directions are conversations I&#x27;m not interested in having.<p>Re: learning through argument, I often find the time I take before sending the response to be helpful in crafting the argument and learning how I feel.

2019-08-24,"Work on phrasing in a non-combative way, ask questions, and define terms.<p>Communication is a combination of content and delivery. You can have great content but if it is delivered poorly then it is much less likely others will appreciate it. And if you deliver a message with poor content then people might be dazzled by your bullshit but in the long run they will see through it.<p>So work on how you deliver your content. Being someone who likes to argue is fine if you actually mean argue and not insult. If you truly want to learn, ask questions. I have found that is a great way to get good answers online. Say someone writes, &quot;Politician X is horrible.&quot; but I think politician x is great. I will resist my urge to insult or just say &quot;No, you are wrong!&quot; or even &quot;What does that mean?&quot; which can be read as having a nasty tone and instead write, &quot;What are some examples of things you think politican x has done that is horrible?&quot; Then I can decide if this person is worth engaging with. If they give an answer that I think indicates that we are entirely too far apart then I stop engaging and move on.<p>This is also part of what my dissertation advisor beat into my head: define your terms. For example, if someone writes, &quot;Most people believe X&quot; well what does &quot;most&quot; mean? 50.1% is a lot different from 99.9%. If they mean 50.1% then maybe we aren&#x27;t that for apart and we are only disagreeing over whether it is 49.9% or 50.1%."

The last job I left was for reasons that had nothing to do with the team or product, or anything easily changeable. I simply wasn&#x27;t OK with the commute to a new office. There are a myriad of personal reasons that someone might not want to work somewhere. That doesn&#x27;t mean the company is flawed - it just means people are different, and have different preferences and needs.<p>I&#x27;d recommend spending less focus on why one person left, and more on ongoing discussions with the people who remain, as well as being sure new staff has every opportunity to learn about the company, so they can self-select out before they are hired if they see anything that would not work well for them."

This is probably your most realistic option anyway. It tends to get old as you get old too. Sometimes it&#x27;s the same arguments (sometimes with the same people, but even without that) get old, or eventually stop mattering to you on an alief level, regardless of your &quot;it does&#x2F;doesn&#x27;t matter&quot; verbal belief level. Sometimes it&#x27;s because you advance your own thinking and then find yourself at a place where it&#x27;s just hard to find people with the same background context, so when you do engage others before you can argue about what you actually want to argue about, you first have to futilely attempt to close the inferential distance they lack because they haven&#x27;t read the books you&#x27;ve read or whatever. It gets old.<p>As a remark on the top comment, I got into Taoist philosophy quite a bit in my teens. It helped (helps) not being attached to outcomes or having a &quot;need&quot; to argue apart from it being pleasurable, it helps cultivate &quot;it doesn&#x27;t really matter&quot; views, but it didn&#x27;t stop me from entering a very argumentative phase anyway. It&#x27;s also fun to just discuss things, but the very act of bringing topics and edge cases and implications thereof up for discussion even if you don&#x27;t strongly hold a conclusion can still comes across as &quot;argumentative&quot;. Oh well.<p>Are these one-on-one chats or group chats you&#x27;re mostly in? As a word of caution, arguing with people one-on-one is a great way to eventually not chat with them at all in the future. (On the other hand not arguing with them is no path to long term conversation either. Not everyone is a creature of the internet.) Sometimes you&#x27;ll find that rare buddy who seems to indulge in your arguing, and can change <i>your</i> mind from time to time too, and they exist, but then some of them are fighting what they perceive to be an attack on their ego rather than what you think is an ego-free discussion trying to reason about a topic and so regardless of the intermediary results the final result of no longer having conversations at all is the same."

2019-08-24,"If uBlock Origin + Privacy Badger give you too many problems, what you are after is a worse setup. You want a less aggressive system that allows the ad-tech that those sites are relying on to work, which will also allow that ad-tech to display some ads and invade some privacy, but its a perfectly reasonable choice.<p>Personally, I use uBlock Origin + Privacy Badger (and NoScript for work, per policy). In most cases, if a site doesn&#x27;t work I&#x27;ve realized I really don&#x27;t want to be there (and the Internet is likely better off without adding my rant to the comments section of that click bait article I really shouldn&#x27;t be wasting my time with).

2019-08-24,"This might not be ideal, but I just don’t bother engaging with people where there are deep fundamental differences in terms of basic values or worldview, especially when it’s obvious they’re not interested in hearing anything contrary. My goal isn’t to convince anyone, it’s to find people with whom I already have some shared basis of understanding and reach a point where we can at least understand each other’s perspective.<p>If I’m truly confident that somebody else is deeply and fundamentally wrong, like creationists or Holocaust deniers or whatever, I don’t take responsibility for their misconceptions and I don’t think I have anything to learn from that person so I just ignore them. Convincing such a person that they are wrong conveys zero benefit to me and is not something that the other person even wants me to do for them. I guess a more positive way of phrasing that is that, when I pick arguments, I do so just as much to give the other person a chance to convince me. If there’s no chance of that happening, it’s not worth my time."

2019-08-24,"Like you I enjoy learning through argument. It rarely works though. This is my conclusion: Most people only pretend to be having a discussion.<p>Actually they are engaged in an emotional battle. Usually the subject matter is part of their self-definition, part of &quot;who they are&quot; so they can&#x27;t really budge on their opinion because it would shake their foundation. Instead they will fight back with everything they have. Illogical arguments, anger etc. Another scenario I see is when &quot;winning&quot; is the important factor, i.e the ego is central. Then also budging is not really an option.<p>I&#x27;m getting better at realizing when the person I&#x27;m talking to is having a battle instead of a discussion and disengage."

It’s that good if you follow people with interesting taste. Feel free to browse my Bandcamp collection[1].<p>- Discogs Diving: Go to Discogs‘ explore section, select a subgenre or two, a decade and&#x2F;or a country of origin. Japanese ambient and new age from the 80s? Sure. Late 70s brazilian soul, jazz, fusion crossovers? Done. Depending on how many results you receive you might want to sort the releases and navigate from popular to obscurity by using pagination parameters. In any case you‘ll like have a few dozens tabs open within minutes.<p>- NTS Radio. As mentioned in another comment. This is radio done right. A large and diverse selection of shows hosted by some of the most competent and knowledgeable selectors and DJs of our time offering finest human curation that is superior to any recommendation engine in my experience.<p>- Online record stores. Record stores have always been a great source for music discovery and that doesn‘t change when things move online. Many of those stores have curated sections showcasing new and noteworthy releases, providing background information and obviously audio samples.

2019-08-24,"I’ve had a series of realizations that have helped me with this.<p>First was that I noticed that on most of my usual internet hangouts, the norm was that if someone is replying to a comment, it must be a disagreement. Even the occasional agreement is often mistaken for disagreement because it’s so uncommon for folks to post in agreement.  The more I noticed this pattern, the less inclined I became to follow it.<p>Second was noticing just how much time and energy I would spend taking down someone’s post in my head, even if I had gotten up from the computer and was doing something else. And while there is something exhilarating about refining an argument, clarifying one’s own thoughts, and then posting them and watching for upvotes, there’s also a very negative energy associated with it that I found lasted a while afterwards. So I came to believe it wasn’t a good trade off.<p>Finally, a tangential realization. At work I noticed a pattern in others and then in myself where product or technical suggestions would be made and then developers would instantly chime in with the reasons it can’t be done.  But it can be done, we have the source code, and our job is to find a way to do it. Dismissing it because our first thought doesn’t work is simply not doing our job. So I learned to suppress any reactions until I’d actually attempted to enable whatever was suggested, and I think this had an effect elsewhere in my life, including posting on the internet."

2019-08-24,"A simple rule can help with this - rephrase all your assertions as questions.  Questioning instead of asserting is inherently less argumentative, is less threatening and more likely to cause the other side to seriously consider your point instead of reacting defensively automatically.  It also signals that you respect their opinion, making them more likely to respect yours.  You accomplish almost all the same goals as asserting, but in a gentler, more mutually respectful and ultimately more effective way."

2019-08-24,"Your curiosity, professional or personal, probably has little bearing on what they tell you. The wording you use doesn&#x27;t matter - exit interviews are always framed as &quot;what we could have done better&#x2F;could do better in the future?&quot; but it is rarely so innocent in reality, and people know this. At best, companies use divulged complaints as a basis for negotiation retain the employee (what if we raised your salary to match your offer? What if we reassigned you to a different manager?) but often it is simply used get the employee to sign a waiver relieving to company of any legal blame. And a likely outcome is that their complaint about their boss gets passed along and it bites them in the ass when they need a referral down the road. So what advantage do they have for being honest? In what way could it possibly benefit THEM to tell you anything?<p>To be honest, a company should always know or be able to figure out the real answer to this question if it their own doing. Either the employee got a better job or the writing was on the wall. If you as a company have people leaving and no one knows why, you don&#x27;t ask the leaving people you ask the people who are staying - Bob is leaving, is there anything we can do to improve YOUR experience? When they are out the door it is too late, so focus on the employees that are there."
2019-08-24,"Online communication greatly suffers from lack of context. When you talk to someone face to face a lot of the message is coming from the body language and the tone of the voice, this makes it clear when the person is joking, serious, naive, confused or whatever reason to look in disagreement with you in a written online conversation. This keeps things from escalating most of the time. Not online.<p>The measures I took for myself:
- ignore conversations with lower importance.<p>- argue with people I know, I trust they are smart enough to understand the discussion and interesting enough to communicate with. Ignore strangers, there is always some stranger that is wrong on Internet, it does not matter, it is not your job to &quot;fix&quot; it<p>- read several times before answering and read my answer several times before pushing the button if the discussion is heated<p>- take in consideration cultural differences.

Define the habits and healthy routine you want and build the lifestyle around it.<p>I was on a crash course for 15 years as a tech exec. 90+ hours work per week, travel, etc.  not by compulsion or financial necessity but by personal drive to be the best at what I was doing. Unfortunately I was literally killing myself.<p>In 2013 I stepped back, applied an engineering&#x2F;tech startup process to researching and analyzing what I really wanted and needed in terms of health and family and built my career and lifestyle around those healthy choices.<p>The result: get more done in less time, focus on things that really move the needle in career and work, tolerate very little noise vs signal, and financially doing 2x better while working 1&#x2F;2 the hours. I’m in better health now than when I was in college. By coincidence, I had a totally unrelated emergency surgical procedure not long after I got into a healthy state, and because I was fit, my body was able to recover very quickly, and my work processes were now so effective, I barely missed a beat in terms of productivity. An MD friend of mine assured me that had I been in my previous poor health state, if I had survived the surgery (his opinion unlikely) recovery would have taken months to years with likely long lasting debilitating effects. And I almost certainly would have lost my career.<p>It will be scary at first, like sweating all night awake with gut wrenching fear scary, but compared to the inevitable health crash that is likely, I expect you won’t regret it."

2019-08-24,"Most of the time people leave bosses, not the job or the company. Almost all interactions are relatively close by, colleagues and their direct boss and if that isn&#x27;t a comfortable environment with trust then usually that is what leads to resignation.<p>If you don&#x27;t know this individual it is unlikely they will honestly tell you why and the boss or coworkers may very well give no honest insight either regardless of the questions. They want out and they don&#x27;t want your organisation ruining their future prospects with a bad reference. Most people do try to fix the problem before they just leave so at this point they consider it not worth voicing the problems further."

2019-08-24,"I use firefox with ublock origin and privacy badger and I can&#x27;t recall the last time I ran into a site that was broken because of it. But, I visit a fairly narrow section of the internet regularly so there might not be much overlap between what I browse and you browse.<p>I also use the multi-account container add on and the temporary container add on. This allows me to pin a few big sites to their own containers (google, amazon, etc) and open all other new tabs in temporary containers. This setup works great and appears to help keep firefox fast over time. I use duck duck go to search but firefox makes it trivial for me to re-run a search with google if I need to.<p>I also run an ad blocking vpn on google cloud using Algo. I use google cloud because the vpn can run on the permanently free tier and I only pay for network traffic (which is near zero), and I also enjoy the irony of it. I have wireguard clients setup on all of my devices to use the vpn either permanently (phone) or on demand (laptops). Having this vpn is nice as it makes it easy to block ads in apps on my kids mobile devices.<p>This vpn setup works ok but not quite as well as when I ran the same thing using Streisand and open vpn clients. I only say this because I have a homebrew whole-house audio setup with a bunch of google audio chromecasts and no matter how I tweak the wireguard client settings I cannot get that casting to work properly. With open vpn clients, those settings are a cinch."

If I log in with Chrome, I can get past the Recaptcha hurdle in just one attempt. But if I am Firefox user, I am forced to submit like 5 Recaptchas, then be greeted with a &quot;Please try again&quot; message, then submit like 5 more, and only then be allowed to log in.

2019-08-24,"This will all depend on what your role in the company is today and what your relationship with this person is.<p>If you are in a leadership role at the company he&#x2F;she may not want to open up to you for fear of reprisal even if you two have been friendly.  If you two are teammates and you do not have a leadership role they may still not feel comfortable opening up to you because likely they have made comments and if no one picked up on it to discuss with them then they will feel you are complicit or accepting of the situation and don&#x27;t want to create tension.<p>There is no harm trying to learn why for sure, but also know sometimes (especially with more senior people) people recognize when their thought processes, methodologies just don&#x27;t align well with a team or company so they will remove themselves.  This doesn&#x27;t actually mean there is anything wrong with the company&#x2F;team or with that person, just they recognized the differences and know those would create conflict, tension or struggles for themselves on the team.  This is a healthy thing to have happen.  That said, it is a very small number of the people that leave usually, more common reasons of leaving are for a lack of recognition, money and&#x2F;or progress.<p>If you and the person leaving are both IC&#x27;s then ask them from a place of curiosity to better understand what they might have seen that you haven&#x27;t.  This is probably the best way to get data points and be non-threatening to the person.  When I say non-threatening, I don&#x27;t mean you literally threatening them, but if you come at them with 20 questions it can start to feel like an interrogation and the persons self defense mechanisms will go up and conversation will go no where.<p>If you are in any kind of leadership role at the company, come at them from the place of not wanting to lose a good person, but respecting that sometimes people move on for a whole host of reasons.  From your perspective you are trying to confidentially understand what the company could do better or change that might make the difference for the next person.  Approach it this way, once they tell you if the asks are reasonable say if we made these adjustments would you stay, but don&#x27;t approach the entire conversation from a place of would you stay.  Approach it from the point of view to make sure issues are resolved for the rest of the team and the next people coming in.  This is the best way to get data points usually and do so in a way people feel more open to chat.  If at the end you ask them if these changes were made would you stay and they say no, then ask why not?  That sometimes will open up a more true reason.<p>*edit: changed a word for readability"
2019-08-24,"one thing that makes this difficult on the internet is that people seem to assume you are arguing with them by default. I&#x27;ve noticed that I tend to get an argumentative followup even if I am agreeing with the OP unless I explicitly state at the beginning that I agree.<p>I suspect that the very structure of voting-based comment sections intensifies this. if you actually follow the etiquette, you upvote posts you agree with instead of leaving a comment to say so. on the other hand, you are <i>not</i> supposed to downvote comments you disagree with. this probably tips the balance enough to make the median comment be a rebuttal to OP. of course, people sometimes respond with supplemental information, but people either twist this to interpret it as an argument or take it as an implicit critique of OP for not including all the relevant information.<p>in the end, I don&#x27;t really have any advice for you; I think it&#x27;s just inherent to the medium. I personally enjoy arguing a lot, but many people I know irl do not. so I just accept the internet for what it is and get my arguing fix here and stick to lighter topics irl."

Because some devices&#x2F;apps will circumvent one of these layers one way or another.<p>I use Pi-Hole plus WireGuard to route all my devices through my home broadband connection (so even on a hotel&#x2F;train WiFi, when on LTE, etc). I forward it to Unbound which uses DNSSEC and DNSCrypt. I&#x27;m using an EdgeRouter Lite for that purpose. It does add a little bit of latency, but I don&#x27;t mind, as it also increases my privacy on the insecure link. It also works on say a smart TV or an official Android device (I use a rooted Android device with microG which doesn&#x27;t implement GAds). My partner sees barely any ads at home due to this setup (I did not bother to setup WireGuard on her smartphone as of yet).<p>On each individual client device I also use a layer 7 firewall (&quot;personal firewall&quot;). On macOS I use Little Snitch and LuLu. On Linux I use OpenSnitch. I don&#x27;t use Windows, but if I would I&#x27;d at least remove all the tracking stuff (for example with O&amp;O ShutUp). On Android, I don&#x27;t use a layer 7 firewall which is my bad.<p>For browser, on every OS I use a configured Firefox (which I did NOT document; my bad!) with a bunch of addons. uBlock Origin (mainly to manually block &quot;you are blocking ads&quot; notices). I use uMatrix, Cookie AutoDelete, Smart Referer, Privacy Badger, Decentraleyes, HTTPS Everywhere, containers for Amazon&#x2F;Facebook&#x2F;Google (would like to add Microsoft), CanvasBlocker, Tracking Token Stripper, Forget Me Not, Terms of Service; Didn’t Read, and Buster: Captcha Solver for Humans.<p>uMatrix <i>will</i> break the web. However it is more user-friendly than NoScript ever was. You are going to have to configure such. For websites you regularly use, you can save the temporary changes, or just not use such bloated websites. Also, I recommend the addon Dark Reader and the feature Reader Mode.<p>To test your setup on your browser, try ipleak.net. One of the things I configured in Firefox, is to disable WebRTC.

I&#x27;ve learned that a frontal assault on a paragraph errant just isn&#x27;t that compelling to write or read.  In heaven and earth and net, I aspire to more.<p>“Like what?”, you may ask.<p>In any conversation (online or not) I can choose several ways to engage:<p>1) I can directly confront the specifics that were written: a conclusion, reasoning, or evidence.  On the net it&#x27;s typical to be contrary, but often in ways that aren&#x27;t especially imaginative or enjoyable for others unless they too just want to argue.<p>2) I can bypass someone else&#x27;s specifics and propose an alternative point of view, a fresh perspective or a confounding dependency that isn&#x27;t common knowledge.  This is likelier to introduce an element of surprise to the exchange, inviting others to dive deeper into the problem or solution space, encouraging others to employ more imagination and not be so binary in debating T&#x2F;F on each point of the assertions.<p>3) I can ask questions: for clarification, to suggest new dependencies or implications, or propose factors or mechanisms that aren&#x27;t necessarily contradictions but might be tangents or parallels or essential unknowns.<p>And if I do choose option #1, to openly disagree, I can voice it in a less confrontational style or focus on only the point I think is most interesting or essential (or amusing).<p>The writing style I choose makes a difference too.  Rather than making bold pronouncements, if I can couch a point as my opinion or a doubt I have, I can deflect rather than provoke.<p>In the end, I have to decide what I want from this exchange,  to discuss ideas or argue.

2019-08-23,"Here are the top 10 problems I faced after starting working remotely full time and moving to another country (both the employer and myself are in the EU) and the findings or solutions I considered or applied.<p>1. Career progression, especially in management is limited.  You will be much better off career-wise in a company that supports and lives remote work than in the one which simply allows it.<p>2. Some people say it&#x27;s difficult to negotiate salary increases, which is true, but not unlike negotiating anything else without personal presence.  So make sure you negotiate during your regular on-site visits.<p>3. On-site visits - those really important for many reasons.  You may like where you are, but even if the company is fully remote you still need to meet all the folks every now and then.  That&#x27;s in our human nature.  However, this is a problem - you need to figure out of often, where to stay etc.  Organising getaways with your team requires extra effort from your manager.<p>4. Meeting participation is difficult.  You must overcome the rudeness of interruption.  With the network lag you will most likely have to interrupt other people all the time in order to be heard.  Also, since you can&#x27;t just draw on the board easily, so make sure you&#x27;re well equipped with tools to run your meetings.  Take notes, close all irrelevant windows and participate fully.<p>5. Most managers want an easy life.  If you are remote and they aren&#x27;t, they need to put extra effort to support you.  This is even worse if you are the manager or team leader yourself.  That means they would often press for reduction in the remote work, so it&#x27;s easier for them.  It would require you to not only prove your worth, as in any workplace you want to grow, but also prove the remote work&#x27;s worth.  Unless there are many more people and the company sees the benefits and opportunities of remote work, it will drain you fast.<p>6. When it comes to payment that is usually quite easy, especially in the EU - a simple bank transfer.  The taxing can be more tricky, but there are four most common options here: A) contracting agreement &#x2F; self-employment &#x2F; invoicing, B) having your employer to set up an office in your country, C) performing the duties of the employer of their behalf by yourself in your country, D) being sent for delegation, and regularly renewing it.  If you&#x27;re in EU that may give you tax benefits, if you live in a lower tax country than your employer is, and there is a decent agreement between those two countries to avoid double taxation.  If you&#x27;re an USA citizen though you&#x27;ll probably not going to like having to pay double taxes.  Please seek advice on that one.<p>7. Health care &#x2F; insurance - in the EU you&#x27;re usually better off not taking the company-offered insurance, but relying on the public health-care entirely and just paying for private visits out of pocket.  If you like extra treatment you can get a private insurance, but it pays off in very few countries and situations.  For the average person the health care in the EU is not that expensive, outside of what you&#x27;re paying in taxes.<p>8. Not moving much.  This is a big one, especially if you&#x27;re working remotely from your home.  You need to exercise a lot and go out as much as you can.<p>9. Educating people around you that remote work is still work.  Your partner, children, parents, friends.  Many of them will not understand at first that even though you&#x27;re at home, you&#x27;re actually working.  On top of that, if you&#x27;re taking a break, that is not to help out with some chores or other gardening tasks.  It&#x27;s the time you take to clear your brain, relax and get back to work afterwards - as if you were in the office.  You wouldn&#x27;t be asked to take the trash out while you went for a break out the office, would you?  So, just find an agreement with your cohabitants - they will easily understand that once you explain it.<p>10. Isolation.  The lack of personal contact with your peers can really hit you.  Make sure you meet with your local friends regularly.  Ideally the people you can laugh with and those you can talk to more seriously.  Also, try to inject random topics when calling your workmates, maybe when the meeting is over early.  They will appreciate that, and so will you.<p>There is a lot more to sort out, but the possible benefits of the remote work are fantastic.  Enjoy!"
2019-08-23,"so, this isn&#x27;t for everyone, but I like the uBlock Origin + uMatrix combo.<p>This will break a lot at first, but uMatrix allows you to build a whitelist easily, and slowly over time website won&#x27;t be broken half as much, and it&#x27;ll be exceptionally rare for you to have to disable the whole extension whenever you want things to get working again."
2019-08-23,"For front end - react is still wildly popular. Svelte is a newer one that&#x27;s beginning to gain traction. I wouldn&#x27;t invest a ton of time in any specific framework (unless you really enjoy using it), but instead would focus on the pros&#x2F;cons of each one and when they&#x27;re good choices. For the most part JS frameworks &#x2F; libs are easy to pick up if you have familiarity with js go begin with.<p>Back end is pretty open. As others have mentioned Go is an up and comer. Hard to predict the market pull for it this early, but it seems promising.<p>Java is still pretty popular, (spring in particular) for web servers. It&#x27;s not talked about much in the blogosphere but there&#x27;s a lot of companies that still need java devs.<p>I can&#x27;t speak to python&#x2F;erlang, as I don&#x27;t have experience with either.

Though, being listed will serve as additional credibility and will likely have branding and SEO benefits for you.<p>On the other hand, we found that building a Zapier integration made customer on-boarding faster and smoother, which helped to speed up our overall sales processes. While slightly different from your use-case, our product requires an API integration, so allowing customers to integrate via Zapier instead of requiring development effort to support our APIs has reduced the cost, time&#x2F;conversations, and resources necessary for our customers to work with us. It also reduces technical support requests.<p>Finally, seconding what lpellegr said, Zapier has now introduced Partner Tiers, meaning that you need to get your own users before you can graduate to a listing level of beta and then even more users before you get other benefits like a blog post and potentially featured status.<p>Overall, I&#x27;d look at whether these benefits are worth the engineering effort. If your main goal&#x2F;priority is marketing then there may be other exciting growth&#x2F;marketing opportunities that would be a better use of time with better ROI. Hope this is helpful."

2019-08-23,"The cynical answer is: binary size is, like the price of gasoline, highly legible all out of proportion to its importance, and for that reason, influential. It&#x27;s easy to see instantly how big a package is because everything reports it as an easy standard metric. You can see binary sizes go up as you add functionality or dependencies. But it&#x27;s not easy to see actual end-user performance, bug-freeness, or security (binary size being only weakly correlated, at best, to things like those, which the user actually cares about). Setting up a meaningful benchmark or testsuite is much harder than noticing that your binary is no longer &lt;5mb. So, the latter happens more than the former."

2019-08-23,"There are a few ways I think about this. The first is to follow the FB framework of focusing on your strengths and interests. The next is to overlap that with what you&#x27;ve been doing at your job most recently. If you&#x27;re a partner you&#x27;ve likely had to shift your focus to selling deals since becoming a partner.  Before then hopefully you had time managing teams of junior consultants.  Because of that, I think your most obviously slots at a tech startup would be in business development or operations.  Don&#x27;t get BD confused with Sales as sales is a much more technical role that I don&#x27;t believe you jump into late into a career at a senior level.<p>Good luck.

2019-08-23,"The most accurate answer w&#x2F;r to the thing you linked is: All binaries used to be much smaller, by a factor of 100x or more. And so on this aspect of performance we have had a kind of regression where most things have a bigger footprint than necessary. Some of it is to be expected since 64-bit code is larger, and Unicode handling is larger, and we support more features even in the smallest CLI tools, but there&#x27;s also an element of the tooling making an optimization that is locally sensible - expand code size to get some runtime performance benefits - and globally useless, since as the featuresets increase an increasing percentage of all code is &quot;run once&#x2F;run never&quot; and not a hot loop, and so it&#x27;s just wasting disk, memory and cache to have it in that configuration."

Less about fancy stationary and pens and group writing sessions, more about one on one correspondence. I&#x27;d post a reading list, or a specific topic, and we&#x27;d spend a good chunk of time going back and forth to whatever end. Maybe in time, I&#x27;d share addresses (with permission) with other writers when I notice a common thread so that the conversation can branch out. I&#x27;d like to think this would be a good way to share ideas, and to learn through the act of writing, one thought after the other. And it would be a great way to practice handwriting.<p>Having had the luxury of stepping away from the screen for a few months to sort out what it is technology is doing to my nervous system, I&#x27;ve been heads down reading Jacques Ellul, Jean Baudrillard, Lewis Mumford, Marshall McLuhan, Neil Postman, Daniel Boorstin, Carl Jung, Alan Hayakawa, C. W. Mills, Guy Debord, Wendell Berry, Hans Magnus Enzensberger, and all sorts of philosophy from Schopenhauer to Spinoza.<p>To be honest, I am having a hard time finding people to talk about this stuff with. That&#x27;s where the idea comes from. On one hand, it seems like people don&#x27;t read much these days. So there&#x27;s that. And on the other hand, I haven&#x27;t found many people who seem concerned about how our habits, behaviors, and thought patterns are changing in response to our digital environments.<p>Perhaps letter writing is too much to ask? I thought a physical note, and actually having a single person to write to, opposed to an unknown audience, would be a nice change of pace.

2019-08-23,"Out of the things you mentioned and what you are looking for, the question might be simplified with technologies currently that will have legs.

There is a large company behind it that is investing it the tech and stack, just like Microsoft isn&#x27;t going to stop with C# anytime soon, I&#x27;d imagine Google is with Go on the long haul.

2019-08-23,"First of all, I think C# as a language and .NET (Core) as a framework were good and are still good choice. You can build whatever you want with it. I don&#x27;t see too much advantage when you now pick another language for the same purpose unless you are somehow limited with C#&#x2F;.NET. If you want to be more valuable on the market you should focus more on what you are able to build. It&#x27;s more valuable when you say, I&#x27;m able to build a web application (classic or SPA), work on the database projects (performance, complex queries), I&#x27;m able to setup an architecture for a distributed system, I&#x27;m able to build microservice cloud hosted systems etc...<p>For every single thing that you are able to build, you pick a language or tool that suits you the best and just keep improving. Each language has it&#x27;s pros and cons but, IMO, what matters the most is the code quality, architecture and the things I mentioned above. Better focus on those skills.<p>If you write nice structured, good organized PHP code (e.q), that is stable in production and which is easy to maintain then you are far better engineer than someone who is showing off with his Rust or Haskell unstructured, not consistent and in the end unstable code. Don&#x27;t let the trendsetters put pressure on you.<p>In the end, if you are are really bored with C#, try to learn some F#. It&#x27;s also .NET but it&#x27;s a different type of language and if nothing happens, in the end, you will write better C# :) Personally I think that SQL is also a good investment. Most of the people avoid it, I don&#x27;t know why, but there are and there will be always jobs for a good SQL developer, especially in big companies where the salaries are also higher.<p>Good luck :)"

Applications are built to do whatever it is that they need to do, and whatever size they end up being is how big they are, almost without exception.<p>The reason CLI binaries are small is that ALL binaries are small. They are compiled, and any resources they need are stored externally in other files. They use shared libraries, making the code even smaller through re-use.<p>I have 1785 programs in &#x2F;usr&#x2F;bin on my Ubuntu server, and all but 10 of them are under 5M.

Hopefully, this will illustrate the power <i>and</i> limitations. We&#x27;d love for people to extrapolate from these onto their own domain-specific automation needs.<p>By touching upon foundational techniques (making imperative code functional, symbolic compilation, SMT encodings, partial evaluation), hopefully the leap to &quot;code synthesis&quot; will seem less like magic and more like an obvious next step. In addition, open-source frameworks exist (e.g., Rosette, Sketch) that abstract away these foundations, and the program will cover those in hands-on workshops.<p>We’d love to hear insights into application from people for whom synthesis is new.

2019-08-22,"A lot of places still have pretty slow&#x2F;unreliable internet. Developing countries often end up being basically mobile-only because it requires less infrastructure, but mobile-only doesn&#x27;t mean 4G in such places. Other times, relatively rich countries will have spotty internet access because of geography: New Zealand famously had very poor internet service for a while because of the complexity around getting cables there, and Australia has such a big difference in population density between urban and rural areas that wiring infrastructure in the sticks is tough. Even in the united states, a surprising number of people are still using dial-up internet because broadband is not available.<p>Another concern is embedded platforms. If rust can&#x27;t produce meaningful code that&#x27;s under a megabyte, then it can&#x27;t be used to write elevator controllers or microwave oven displays or to program pacemakers -- and as regular computers get more RAM to try to make up for the end of Moore&#x27;s law, a larger and larger percentage of cases where it makes sense to use a compiled systems language over a JITed scripting language will be embedded ones. To some people, if a compiler can&#x27;t produce 1k binaries, it&#x27;s worthless because it forces you to substitute in a beefier machine.<p>There&#x27;s also general performance and security concerns: any unnecessary code adds to both vulnerability surface &amp; footprint. If you work your system really hard &amp; you&#x27;re always a meg or two short of running out of RAM, then saving a meg or two of code size matters a whole lot. (This applies less to desktops &amp; more to applications where you might process lots of data on off-the-shelf hardware: if you&#x27;re clever &amp; take advantage of parallelism, you can process many TB of data on a machine with less than a gig of ram in a relatively short time, and you can cut it down further if you can run more copies of your application, which you can do better if your memory footprint is smaller.)<p>Finally, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s safe to overestimate what percentage of machines are less than eleven years old. Ever since Moore&#x27;s Law ended, the case for upgrading hardware has been a lot weaker, and even when it was running strong folks often went a decade without doing so.<p>Bloat doesn&#x27;t necessarily translate into usability, and usability doesn&#x27;t necessarily transfer between users.

If these are behaviors they personaly can’t accept in a shipping product I’d totaly see devs ignoring arbitrary deadlines.<p>For instance I don’t think most people woud want to ship potentially data destroying code, even with a PO on their back pestering for a release of the rest. And a defense mechanism for that would be to cripple pieces of the main scenario until the critical cases are covered, if they can’t otherwise negociate that.<p>I am basing that on the fact that it’s a recurring event and from specific devs."
2019-08-22,"Hi Nick! Happy to answer from my point of view. I just reduced one of my packages to 1&#x2F;1000 its original size: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bundlephobia.com&#x2F;result?p=drive-db@5.0.0"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bundlephobia.com&#x2F;result?p=drive-db@5.0.0</a><p>There are several reasons that I like small packages, both when making them and when consuming them:<p>- Easier to maintain. One packages does a single thing, it&#x27;s easy to reason and compose with other packages. This is specially true for utility packages. It&#x27;s easier to document a single thing, to debug a single functionality, etc.<p>- Faster installs. It does take several minutes under certain circumstances to install larger packages&#x2F;projects for me. Not everyone using tech tools live in a world with fast internet. Sure this amounts to ~30 min&#x2F;week max, but would prefer to use my time differently.<p>- You say 30-50mb, but my typical React project is 80-100 MB in node_modules. As an example, my current laptop is ~4 months old, and the &quot;projects&quot; folder has 670k+ files and weights 6+ GB.<p>- Copying projects. While you talk about binaries, it&#x27;s usual that it&#x27;s either a single minified file with a decent size, or hundreds&#x2F;thousands of dependencies. While the size itself doesn&#x27;t matter so much, the amount of files matters for things like backups, searching in files, etc.<p>- Signaling. People who care about this, normally won&#x27;t throw a lot of dependencies on top of it if it can be easily avoided. So you know there aren&#x27;t many surprises normally or Guy Fieri images: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;s&#x2F;silicon-satire&#x2F;i-peeked-into-my-node-modules-directory-and-you-wont-believe-what-happened-next-b89f63d21558"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;s&#x2F;silicon-satire&#x2F;i-peeked-into-my-node-mo...</a><p>- Marketing. Many people care about it for these or other reasons. Everything else being the same, a smaller package is better, so there&#x27;s no disadvantage if you can easily shed some of the library size. I don&#x27;t care that much, especially because of what you say. But some people seem to do.<p>- Tooling is easy! Rollup, webpack, uglify, etc. There are many easy (okay, not Webpack) projects to bundle and minimize a project, which are needed from front-end JS.<p>Now, I wouldn&#x27;t optimize at the expense of usability or dev time. For instance, the two features I removed from `drive-db` were removed because they were half-baked. File cache ~&gt; replaced by in-memory cache, which also allows for browser and Cloudflare Worker usage (the main point for refactoring). MongoDB-like queries? ~&gt; JS today is good enough not to need those for a small spreadsheet. They didn&#x27;t work the same as MongoDB, and not even I, the library author, used them ever."

2019-08-22,"How is your organization structured in regards to dev and QA?  Do your devs feel like QA is there to help them succeed, or to catch them in their mistakes?<p>I worked for a company that briefly had a &quot;bug scoreboard,&quot; where QA were rewarded for finding a larger quantity of bugs, regardless of quality.  Typos, weird UI things being 1px off (no joke), weird edge-case stuff like &quot;if I load this item into my cart in Chrome, but then change the quantity in IE, and then try to check out in FireFox, it will say I&#x27;m not logged in...&quot;  The value was next to nil.<p>As was the company&#x27;s way, each bug was logged (as is good), but because the bugs were usually found in the test environments, the devs who were actively doing the work felt like they were being directly attacked for focusing on the big picture and NOT the edge cases.<p>This ultimately lead to the QA director being demoted, once management realized how much money was being wasted on meaningless stuff and not being spent actually improving the site, but the damage was done -- some devs who were working in that environment will never trust QA again.<p>So, to simplify my question: do your devs feel punished by missing edge cases, or do they feel rewarded by providing functionality?"

2019-08-22,"Often the first step I take is just make it work, in most straightforward way. Make sure that it is tested. When I say tested, I do not mean, write a unit test for each permutation for each small piece of code. You don’t want to test the implementation, but focus on the behavior, what should this code do to make the customer happy.<p>If that is done, I start refactoring. I now know the problem space much better, making it easier to do sweeping changes of interfaces, and because the test are most focused on behavior and the interfaces, that shouldn’t require that much work.<p>When i’m Happy with the design, and the basics are working. I start working on the edge cases, and to refactor the internal implementation to something that is focused on maintainability.<p>So I think your approach should be to teach your colleges to first, just make it work.<p>That said, if you are a team lead, I think you should think of the psychology of your developers. Why are they so focused on the edge cases. Does the business blame them when it goes wrong. Are the stories over promising, leaving little interpretation for the developers to only think about the gold road.<p>If that is the case you should definitely be more involved when the features get specified. If everyone is clear what edge cases are not involved, then it will lift the burden of the person coding the feature.<p>Also, perhaps you should move the developers to projects were a more rigid approach fits the project.

2019-08-22,"&gt; Family has a bunch of photo albums laying around, that I&#x27;d like to digitize for better accessibility and durability.<p>Don&#x27;t do this for durability, unless you&#x27;ve already got a robust backup solution. Hard drives tend to fail predictably.<p>&gt; I assume most top-feeding scanners will have problems with the thick paper and the glued-on photos.<p>The majority of page feeders (like in MFCs) have a tight 180° turn to flip the page down to the scanner plate. You may find a straight-through paper feeder, but also make sure thick media can be handled.<p>&gt; So do I need to do it page by page manually?<p>Yup.<p>&gt; What resolution and what file format should I use?<p>Continuous tone images (like portraits) are fine at 150-200dpi. High contrast line art is better at 300dpi, and depending on the printer, you can see up to 800dpi with your eyes (without a loupe). Standard line art film can be rendered at 1500dpi.<p>So, take the largest you want to print out at, multiply by ~300, then multiply by 1.5 (ish) to allow for cropping, and you know how many pixels you want. For example, for an 8×10, you want (8×300×1.5): 3600×4500.<p>You can save as TIFF to be lossless and allow for higher bit depths for more exposure adjustment headroom, but if you aren&#x27;t mucking with levels, you really won&#x27;t see JPEG artifacts, especially if you save at 90-95% quality. JPEG file sizes will be dramatically smaller than TIFF.<p>&gt; Any experiences?<p>Like my Grandma told me, put dates on everything.<p>Consider adding a date (maybe with a label maker?) to each page before you scan it."

This failed, not just in its top-level outcomes but also in most of its details along the way. A community like this doesn&#x27;t respond well to &quot;harnessing&quot;. Trying to bring it into any purpose-driven order seems to have a dumbing-down effect. Genuine intelligence, to the extent that it shows up, does so in the small, randomly, and without a purpose. If you try to make it happen in any predictable way, that discourages it. There are a lot of counterintuitive effects like that.<p>Edit: but I should say something positive too. If you do find a way to join forces with others in a project for social good, or anything else really, you can often get surprisingly interesting feedback from the HN community about it. It will just be sporadic.<p>One of these years I want to work on ways to support HN users to form more real-world connections with each other.

If you are more on the product side, work with their dev lead on why you think their approaches are not getting the results you hope for.<p>In short, this should be resolved by having open conversations with the team.<p>As a side note, do not blame devs for a project failure.

And you can quickly implement detections and controls based on attacker TTP which has a greater ROI than playing whack-a-mole with CVEs or rely on updated firewall rules,av rules,selinux rules,etc...<p>2) Log as much as possible and do something with the logs. Log everything and continue to improve your SIEM or security stack based on new threat intel.<p>3) Low effort,high ROI low hanging fruits. 2FA everything. Mutual certificate auth where i can. Turn on bitlocker. Make people use password managers,ssh pubkey auth. If you have typical corporate firewall&#x2F;proxy: block any domain that isn&#x27;t categorized or newly registered.<p>4) this is what I think will be good ,haven&#x27;t done it IRL: segment network well. Remote management can only happen from jump boxes. Be hostile against removable drives.

To mitigate this, I think having full pages breaking down each of those sections (instead of just paragraph sections) would be helpful. I like these short summaries, but additionally linking out to full sub-product detail pages would be very helpful. I wonder how each of these sub-products compare to their full product alternatives and don&#x27;t quite understand from the landing page how interconnected they all are in order to make me willing to forego certain features&#x2F;functionality for the sake of data organization.<p>As an example: We use Pipedrive as our CRM - it has concepts like: User ACL, Deals, Contacts, Organizations, Activities, etc. It offers visual workflow automation, a robust API, and advanced filtering searching capabilities. I&#x27;d like to see all of the features I&#x27;d get with Burnout&#x27;s CRM to help me evaluate the product before I&#x27;d consider switching.<p>Regarding the name: personally, as a founder&#x2F;engineer, when I hear the term burnout I think of the negative mental&#x2F;physical&#x2F;emotional state that I (and friends&#x2F;teammates) have experienced in the past - so the name puts me off. A suggestion could be something like (warning: bad ideas alert): Startup (another play on words - since this guides you through starting up) or Blueprint.<p>It looks like you&#x27;ve built a ton of product here and I&#x27;m excited to see a live demo and check it out myself."

2019-08-21,"Nope. There&#x27;s no single algorithm that will lead to General intelligence. As long as the apex of our ML techniques is parameter optimization via gradient decent, there will be no critical mass point. Currently, it&#x27;s possible for someone to take a modular approach to general intelligence. And someone may very well be working on that and will spring such a system on the world but because each subsystem is only as good as the state of the art, and if the systems were that good the developers would try to capitalize on such a system immediately rather than waiting for all the other subsystems to surpass the state of the art, we would have some warning that the field was advancing; hence no surprise general intelligence."

Some also generate forms on the fly, but eventually it&#x27;s necessary to: specify a forms widget for a particular field because SQL schema only describes the data and not the UI; and specify security authorization restrictions on who can create, read, update, or delete data.<p>And then you want to write arbitrary queries to filter on columns that aren&#x27;t indexed; but it&#x27;s really dangerous to allow clients to run arbitrary SQL queries because there basically are no row&#x2F;object-level database permissions (the application must enforce row-level permissions).<p>Datasette is a great tool for read-only database introspection and queries of SQLite databases. <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;simonw&#x2F;datasette"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;simonw&#x2F;datasette</a><p>Sandman2 generates a REST API for an arbitrary database. <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jeffknupp&#x2F;sandman2"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jeffknupp&#x2F;sandman2</a><p>You can generate Django models and then write admin.py files for each model&#x2F;table that you want to expose in the django.contrib.admin interface.<p>There are a number of apps for providing a GraphQL API given introspection of a database that occurs at every startup or at runtime; but that doesn&#x27;t solve for row-level permissions (or web forms)<p>If you have an OpenAPI spec for the REST API that runs atop The database, you can generate forms (&quot;scaffolding&quot;) from the OpenAPI spec and then customize those with form widgets; optionally with something like json-schema.<p>It&#x27;s not safe to allow introspected CRUD like e.g. phpMyAdmin for anything but development.

What are some specific examples?<p>I made a startpage that makes searching much easier and faster. There&#x27;s a text entry field, then buttons for: 5 other search engines, and for Google: search, search in previous year, verbatim, image, large image, video, &gt;20 mins video, Google books, Google scholar, then buttons for wikipedia, LaTeX, IMDb etc (that add those words to a google search) - i.e. add buttons for your most-used search terms. Also I have buttons for searching within youtube and LibGen. Then after unsuccessfully searching, just go Back to the startpage with the search terms still there. Before that I used to have to type what I was searching for multiple times, e.g. searching for obscure books&#x2F;movies. For JS you could have 1-button searching within your favourite docs&#x2F;sites. Or just hyperlinks to online manuals. There&#x27;s a lot of buttons, but colour-coded and grouped it&#x27;s not confusing - grey = add words to text field (also &quot;clear field&quot;, &quot;put quotes around&quot;, &quot;filetype:pdf&quot; etc), blue = google search e.g wikipedia, image; red = youtube searches, yellow = LibGen searches, white = video&#x2F;book sites, black = torrent sites.

You even make comments such as:<p>&quot;How likely is it for the property to appreciate over time?<p>While appreciation it is not guaranteed but there is a high likelihood that real estate appreciates over time assuming a minimum investment duration of 5 years.&quot;<p>There are a lot of factors that go into whether or not a property will appreciate over time and you don&#x27;t list any of those or give any sort of details. You are letting people pick their own property in areas that you, presumably, have no knowledge of market conditions but yet you are saying that it is highly likely that people will gain appreciation in their property.<p>In the FAQ you also state:<p>&quot;Would you say this is similar to Landa?<p>The difference is we allow individual users to invest together in a property, we don&#x27;t necessarily own the properties instead we facilitate the investment process.&quot;<p>What conditions do you own the properties? What part of the investment process do you facilitate? On your landing page you state:<p>&quot;
Invest With Others<p>AlphaCap allows anyone to buy equity in any real estate property that is on sale, once 100% of the purchase price is funded we purchase the property on your behalf and manage the property and start sending you monthly rental income.
&quot;<p>It says you purchase the property on the customer&#x27;s behalf but who is the property registered to? Is it your company until all the money is repaid? Is it all of the people investing in the property?<p>You also state in your FAQ as one of the benefits:<p>&quot;
Best part is you can use other people&#x27;s money as leverage to buy much more property, and if the deal makes sense at the time of purchase&#x2F;deal analysis, you won&#x27;t be over-leveraged and will stand to make money, with multiple exits as options.&quot;<p>First off, I find this irresponsible by suggesting people take on large amount of risk while not even mentioning the amount of risk that they could be taking on. And what does it mean: &quot;if the deal makes sense at the time of purchase&quot;? Make sense to who? Speaking of risk, there is not a single spot on your landing page or your FAQ that even has the word &quot;risk&quot;.<p>Lower in your FAQ you state:<p>&quot;What happens in case of a massive destruction by the tenant?<p>There is insurance on the property and there is deposit required for tenants. As part of the management process we also vet tenants before they move in. For any damages we will deduct the cost from the tenant&#x27;s deposit.&quot;<p>So are you also a property management company? If so, are people who buy partial real estate through your site bound to use you as the property management company or could they go and pick another management company if they want.<p>&quot;What happens is a property is bought, but you can&#x27;t rent it? Who pays the bill of the empty place?<p>Typically we have a vacancy rate of less 10%, we do our best to rent the property as quickly as possible to the most qualified tenant.&quot;<p>You don&#x27;t even answer the question. Who is responsible? What does &quot;as quickly as possible&quot; mean in this situation? To me, it sounds like you would drop below market rates to fill a vacancy.<p>Something that isn&#x27;t covered in your FAQ is maintenance. Who is in charge of that? If a plumber is needed do I have to pay for that?<p>I realize I may be coming off as harsh or abrasive and for that I&#x27;m truly sorry but as your site stands it seems to be made to take advantage of those with minimal real estate knowledge hoping to invest their money.

2019-08-20,"One thing will be trying to reach out to hiring managers and internal recruiters directly instead of working with third-party recruiters. Third-party recruiters try to maximize their referral fee by matching your experience to the job description exactly; hiring managers and internal recruiters get quite a bit more leeway. Is there a coding bootcamp nearby that you could teach or TA? It&#x27;s an awesome way to make easy connections with local employers; growing your network is a long term investment, but if in two years it can get you a better job it is worth it.<p>I&#x27;m also self taught and started with a terrible job cycle that I&#x27;m still working out of. I talk to recruiters all of the time, and I also refer friends to them and it gets me bonus considerations. Recently I called one up and had a very frank conversation on my career goals; she didn&#x27;t have a job for me but gave me some very nice pointers (basically how to highlight things in my resume in a way that&#x27;ll stand out to the five second scan of a recruiter).

If so I&#x27;m all for suggestions!<p>Intro - General Contracting company with 25-40 projects running at any given time across the continental United states. Each project has 1 On-Site superintendent. Each project has an assigned Project Manager who typically oversees 3-5 projects at a time. Many subcontractors are also re-used on various projects once you find one that does good work.<p>Problem - When a project comes to an end, or a 2 week delay hits a particular job, the On-Site superintendents get shuffled around from site to site. This can be said for subcontractors as well. Communication is key when trying to get all moving parts into place, and if a new project starts knowing what team members you have available vs what members are being used would be valuable to receive at a glance.<p>Idea&#x2F;Solution - Have a simple map, with the ability to &#x27;pin&#x27; a particular person&#x2F;subcontractor or group to the map. Have the ability to add job #, contract # or other notes to the Pin. Have start&#x2F;end dates be added to the pins. Have this be available company wide as read-only for those who need it simply to know who is where in case the main coordinator is busy. Have it be editable by select people within the company or even have one admin account if having an entire AD setup with permissions would be difficult.<p>Would prefer to be self-hosted, however have no problems using it online if it had proper security measures."

2019-08-19,"Conditionals allow a program to <i>react</i> to the data it is presented with. This can be data from the outside world, or data from some other module internal to a program composed out of modules (i.e. subroutines, for example). Without conditionals - or their moral equivalent - programs would not be able to react to their inputs or to changes in their internal state.<p>--<p>There are Turing-complete languages without conditionals, though - even without data, as such! An example is the lambda calculus. If you want to learn more about this, read up on &quot;Church encoding&quot; and &quot;Scott encoding&quot;.<p>The basic idea is to use functions and the visitor pattern to encode a kind of conditional behaviour that varies with the input supplied to it.<p><pre><code>  True = (lambda (t f) (t))
  False = (lambda (t f) (f))
  If = (lambda (b tr fa) (b tr fa))

  (lambda (x)
    (If x
        (lambda () (display &quot;It was true!&quot;))
        (lambda () (display &quot;It was false!&quot;))))
</code></pre>
Desk check the reductions of applying that function to True and to False. The &quot;t&quot; and &quot;f&quot; arguments <i>to the boolean values</i> act as a kind of &quot;menu&quot; (the visitor pattern), from which the datum selects in order to communicate what variant of data it is. The pattern extends readily to natural numbers, lists, and so on, giving a straightforward encoding of not only conditionals, but also (one-layer-deep) pattern matching."
2019-08-19,"Without conditionals, every program either terminates after a pre-specified amount of computation or never terminates.  That leaves you extremely limited in what you can accomplish (less powerful than a DFA).<p>A DFA or maybe a 2DFA (which are equally powerful) is basically what you get when <i>all</i> you have is conditionals.<p>Without that, what you have is a box that can read finite input and compute a value. Equivalent to a finite lookup table."

When it comes to learning there are no time constraints, no competition and nothing matters outside of &quot;grokking it&quot; to your own standards.<p>Do lots of Internet research, Identify offbeat subjects&#x2F;people, Browse bookstores and keep buying Books :-)<p>Always be on the lookout for something <i>different</i> from the commonplace and the norm. Generally, the &quot;populace&quot; only looks at the obvious, popular and the lowest common denominator. Hence identify people&#x2F;books who are contrarians, look into nooks and crannies of various subjects and try and understand their viewpoints.

2019-08-19,"Some operations are basic enough that theoretically you can build any other operation out of them. “NAND” is commonly used as an example but in practice “nand” doesn’t really map to how people think. Conditionals are another one. They are a bit more complicated in a sense (three inputs rather than two) but they map better to how people think so people actually use them in practice.<p>So Turing completeness is basically two things. 1: the ability to compose an arbitrary number of conditional statements. 2: the ability to keep computing recursively, until some output is true."
2019-08-19,"I apologize, but I really am having a hard time understanding your question at all. Every non-trivial computation requires some kind of conditional.<p>The first computers were literally people, they computed. There wasn&#x27;t really a lot of &quot;conditional&quot; work to what they did, they did <i>math</i> (principally numerical work) like generating tables of data and compiling the results. They still needed some conditionals, like if a value was over a certain threshold, use a particular formula or change some parameter.<p>The early mechanical computers were largely tabulators of the same sort, but machines and not people. But as you want to express more complicated computations, you need the ability to branch. Conditionals are just a means for executing such a branch. Even the simplest of computational machines (in the theory sense) like regular expressions and deterministic finite automata include a branch or conditional element: Given input C while in state S go to state S&#x27;. A simple way to visualize this decision matrix is with a table:<p><pre><code>  Input | S_0 | S_1
  -----------------
    0   | S_0 | S_0
    1   | S_1 | S_1
  Accepting states = {S_0}
</code></pre>
Is a simple machine that will recognize any binary string ending in &#x27;0&#x27;. In each state, a decision is made on what the next state should be based on the input. This isn&#x27;t even a Turing complete system, DFAs can only recognize regular languages. This cannot be done without some sort of conditional branching capability. You may be able to encode this in a hardware description language such that the conditional is obscured or obfuscated, but it&#x27;s still there.<p>Even trying to compute taxes or payroll depended on conditionals (income level determines which tax brackets you pay into, over a certain amount of income you&#x27;ve maxed out Social Security). And that was one of the earliest (commercial) uses for computational devices.<p>Now, the way we express conditionals may change from one language or system to another. In Erlang, you can remove a lot of `if` expressions using pattern matching, consider the simple computation of the Fibonacci numbers as an example:<p><pre><code>  fib(0) -&gt; 1;
  fib(1) -&gt; 1;
  fib(N) -&gt; fib(N-1) + fib(N-2).
</code></pre>
A conditional is right there: If N = 0, return 1; if N = 1, return 1; else return fib(N-1)+fib(N-2). Haskell and other functional languages use similar constructs, and you can include other guards:<p><pre><code>  fib(0) -&gt; 1;
  fib(1) -&gt; 1;
  fib(N) when N &gt; 1, is_integer(N) -&gt; fib(N-1) + fib(N-2).
</code></pre>
This removes the potential for infinite recursion by adding an additional guard, now this function is only valid for non-negative, integral inputs. It has been transformed now to: If N = 0, return 1; if N = 1, return 1; if N &gt; 1 and N is an integer, return fib(N-1)+fib(N-2); else signal an error."

Trading with other players is a MUST. Every player has a limited number of professions (from simple ones like agriculture and mining to nuclear weapons manufacturing or software programming) and most of them need things that only others can provice, hence the need of trading.<p>Imagine an Eve Online without the 3D, where you only manage stuff and the stuff you do works even when you&#x27;re offline.<p>The second game is a mixture of a rogulike, Skyrim with graphics like Graveyard Keeper.

2019-08-19,"I think it is like any profession, there are good and bad ones and there are some that provide lots of value and others that make it their mission to gouge every client for every penny.  The biggest lesson I have about attorneys in general is same advice I give people when they go to the doctor.  Don&#x27;t just blindly trust what they tell you, challenge them, educate yourself on the issues and if they won&#x27;t discuss it with you intelligently, find someone else.<p>In my personal experience I have found that when I find a good lawyer they are worth every penny they charge regardless of the rate.  The best lawyer I ever had was a $450&#x2F;hr partner in a smaller firm but he was spectacular and what he would bill me an hour for I had other lawyers in the past bill 1&#x2F;2 day for, so his value was high but his quality was also stellar.  On the face of it his original $5k retainer didn&#x27;t feel like it was buying much, but after seeing how productive he was and how good he is, he&#x27;s worth more than what he charges.  He specializes in employment and contract employment law, nothing else, so a fairly narrow focus by many standards but still a big area IMO.<p>Other times I have been gouged.  One I hired to provide me with pros&#x2F;cons of specific business legal structures I was contemplating for asset protection and separation of risks.  She came back to me after charging $1,000 with a 1 paragraph memo that told me to do whatever cause they would all be equal in protection.  I challenged her but learned she just was a moron when it came to understanding risk mitigation and asset protection even though she advertised it and was recommended by another lawyer.  When I took her memo and my requests to a firm that had more of a reputation they took ~4 hours and gave me back a 5 page memo of recommendation based on pros&#x2F;cons and had I followed the original advice I could&#x27;ve put a ton of stuff at risk.<p>Just my 2 cents too, I don&#x27;t think woman vs man, or old vs young makes a damn bit of difference overall.  Experience does matter, but I wouldn&#x27;t choose or disregard anyone over anything but bad recommendations or poor quality of work.<p>One last point, as you asked about overcharging which I gave you some personal experiences around value etc. But something else I have seen many firms charging monthly retainers in the multiple thousands of dollars for startups to have an attorney on call.  I do not subscribe to this nor recommend it in general.  Yes you need to retain a solid attorney and firm to get them familiar with your business and help setup the initial contracts etc. But there is no way you need a $3000&#x2F;month retainer when just starting out like I have seen happening in the past few years.  Same with accounting, you don&#x27;t need a $3000 accountant retainer every month to book 30 transactions.  You can hire a consulting book keeper to do that work and have an accounting firm review quarterly for a lot less money.  A caveat, if you are negotiating enterprise deals or dealing with a highly regulated business then the attorney on a monthly may well be necessary early on, even before you have real revenue."

If somebody crashes their car while using the app they might blame you and sue you.<p>There is a huge amount of controversy about where the dangers lie in using technology with driving.  Personally I am not concerned about the hands as I am the eyes.  If you have to look away from the road for two seconds you are covering a frightful amount of ground and have no chance of detecting something dangerous.  To some extent you can mitigate this by carefully setting up the field of view such that your device is the center of the view but you still have peripheral version out the front window.  Even if your hands and eyes are not affected,  there is still the risk you could be mentally or emotionally tilted by some message you exchange with people.  In fact,  when I took a defensive driving class they said I shouldn&#x27;t even get in the car if I am emotionally upset about something.<p>There has been some talk about distracted driving risks with the police.

2019-08-19,"There are styles of programming with no conditionals, especially in purely functional languages.<p>A common technique inside compilers is to separate out which code gets run, and which result gets used. If everything is side-effect-free, then there&#x27;s no harm in running the code whose result won&#x27;t get used. In highly parallel systems, you can just run both versions and select at the end. So you can rewrite:<p><pre><code>  if foo &lt; 2:
    a = foo
  else
    a = 2
</code></pre>
to:<p><pre><code>  a = phi(foo&lt;2, 2, foo)

2019-08-19,"Conditionals actually destroy information. The way they are written does not even matter; Consider the evaluation of this functional pseudocode:<p><pre><code>   min(a,b) := if(a &lt; b, a, b)
</code></pre>
Obviously, the evaluation of this function looses information about either a or b. This is of course by intention. But this is incompatible to a closed (quantum) system where information must be preserved.<p>Interestingly (but I think there is no deeper connection), vectorization uses masks to avoid branching. Programmatically, one implements then both branches at the same time, and on a per-data level different operations are performed. A simple pseudo-numpy example would be<p><pre><code>   B[where(A &lt; B)] = A
   which should actually read component by component, for
   instance, having A and B being matrices,

      B_{ij} = A_{ij}  if A_{ij} &lt; B_{ij}
               B_{ij}  else  (&quot;no-op&quot;)

So, my suggestion is to find a different industry for which you will write software and to find a company that takes the software development seriously. Whatever path you take, good luck :)"

2019-08-19,"I&#x27;m not affiliated with YC, but I do make B2B software. Could you potentially give partial ownership or indefinite free use of the service to the first customer and have them put you on payroll? Getting VC investment in B2B will likely be challenging. Most B2B ideas don&#x27;t scale to billion dollar companies. The market isn&#x27;t the world so much as some niche that caps out around XX million dollars. That&#x27;s hugely successful under most circumstances, but can be perceived as a failure for a VC firm.<p>I work in a space where VCs are investing 10 to 30 million in new companies, but have inside information from existing older firms that pretty much ensures any company in the space will have a max valuation around 100 million; if all the stars align. As such, these new companies are destined to fail simply because the money they received to build their product isn&#x27;t proportional to market capacity for the product.<p>That said, I also have no idea what the idea or market is, so I could be way off base."

2019-08-19,"Not a company, but I think direct scaling based on time is about as fair as you can get.<p>An employee that works 4 days is likely to produce more than 80% of the output of someone who works 5 days, all else being equal, so even though fixed costs may not scale down, payment per &quot;unit work&quot; should remain constant.<p>This may not hold if you went down to, say, 1 day per week."

Value for money, the 4-day week constraint keeps people busy enough to actually get things done fast.<p>I don&#x27;t know what their difference in comp was, but my impression each time was they had negotiated the 4-day week against the cost of a consultant. e.g. As an employer, maybe you want to pay an employee $120k&#x2F;y salary. To replace that employee with a contractor will cost you $220k&#x2F;year. The employees pitch was, given what it would cost and what they can make consulting, they would take the offered $120k salary for a 4-day&#x2F;week role.<p>It&#x27;s a question of value, not scaling to hours."

2019-08-19,"If you are paying contractor rates, then that makes sense of course.<p>For a permanent hire I think it would be reasonable to ask more than half. Even working 50% hours, one does not usually completely unplug during other half - even if not active on corporate systems it&#x27;s likely they&#x27;re taking problems away and thinking them over.<p>I think you may be surprised by the output you get - when I have worked with part time technical staff in the past, it often seems to help grant a laser focus of sorts."

2) Split up the repo and give each repo its own CI which runs when files in the subrepo change.

Of course, there are degrees of anonymity and security associated with different instruments and you will have to find the one that works for you.<p>I guess the most anonymous and secure payment method would be to work anonymously for a cryptocurrency (i.e. a job that doesn&#x27;t require you to give your personal information), and then use that to pay for your illegal goods.

The surgical team principle is one that I pushed for heavily when leading a competitive robotics team in college and found to work quite well. I think that organizing an actual software development team to work in this manner would be difficult, but the limited ability to have many people working on the physical robot at once made the surgical team approach worthwhile.<p>The book typically referenced the scarce resource of compile time, which is not a concern today. I can&#x27;t really think of a good parallel to that scarcity in software development today, but in a situation like the robotics team where there was a truly scarce resource to be shared amongst the group (the robot) the surgical team approach worked excellently."

My goal is to make a travel portable NAS. I can connect SD cards, any wireless device, or any USB device. I have access to my media on my server but public&#x2F;hotel WiFi can make accessing video a pain. I’m editing on an older iPad that is storage limited as well. I just wanted to be able to have local copies of media accessible over WiFi for use on phones&#x2F;tablets.<p>My solution was a NanoPC-T4 with a 1 TB m.2 SSD. Using hostapd it acts as a hotspot and using samba it shares files. My todo list includes adding encryption and a web interface for configuration as well as some kind of battery power.<p>Anyway, from what I’ve gathered playing with all of this, a single board computer with storage might cover your needs.

2019-08-18,"In general it&#x27;s very difficult to interview in a way that would give insight into previous work experiences at a practical level. Every interviewee will have their own unique experiences and even though they may all have similar backgrounds, designing an interview question that would be general enough to gain insight into all of their experiences is nearly impossible. I&#x27;ve interviewed at places that attempt this and I&#x27;ve never felt that it worked out the way they were intending it too. They usually become too specific to the ideas&#x2F;experiences of the person who designs the question.<p>I think algorithm and data structure problems can be useful if used correctly. I think the main issue is that most companies tend to use leetcode style problems which are a bit more on the brain-teaser side and are often usually harder to solve if you haven&#x27;t spent a significant amount of time solving such problems. These questions might make sense for super competitive positions at places like Google where they can afford to reject good candidates, but at most companies it doesn&#x27;t make sense.

2019-08-18,"Maybe it would be possible to give a somewhat useful first answer just as a post here; I&#x27;ll try.<p>Going way back in computing, often an important issue was, how fast will a program run?  That study is now sometimes called <i>computational time complexity</i>.<p>This study was important because, for some common work, some ways of programming the work ran many times faster than some other ways -- i.e., the study of computational time complexity got some big results.<p>Usually in practice an issue of a little less concern than running time was how much of the computer main memory would a program need, and this study was <i>computational space complexity</i>.<p>The first big case of big gains was running time for sorting. So, for some positive integer n, we are given n numbers (or alphabetic names, etc.) and want to sort them into ascending order.  So, an obvious first approach is to look at all n numbers one at a time and find the smallest.  Then look at the remaining n - 1 numbers and again find the smallest. Then with a little algebra, the running time grows proportional to n^2 (n times n, n <i>squared</i>).  So we say (I&#x27;m omitting some fine points) that the running time is &quot;big O n^2&quot; written<p>O(n^2).<p>Now for some big stuff:  (1) There is a way (method, technique, <i>algorithm</i>) called <i>heap sort</i> with running time (computational time complexity)<p>O(n log(n) )<p>both on average for <i>random</i> numbers and also for the worst case of the order of the given n numbers.  (2) Heap sort works by comparing numbers two at a time (so did our<p>O(n^2)<p>algorithm above), and there is a cute counting result from A. Gleason, long a math prof at Harvard, that shows that for sorting by comparing numbers two at a time<p>O(n log(n) )<p>is the fastest possible.  (3) Heap sort is also <i>in-place</i> which means that the storage used, except for a constant independent of n, is just what is needed for the n numbers being sorted.<p>After sorting, there was interest in working with <i>trees</i>.  Likely the tree most people are most familiar with is the hierarchical file system.  A tree can be good for keeping a set of numbers in order while adding numbers to the set or removing numbers from the set.  To get good guaranteed fast running time, we want the tree <i>balanced</i>, that is, all the paths in the tree from the root to the leaves are about the same length.  So, keeping the tree balanced while making the changes and doing so with relatively fast worst case running time was a challenge.  One solution was AVL trees (see D. Knuth&#x27;s <i>The Art of Computer Programming:  Sorting and Searching</i> or more recent books listed in this thread) and, mostly for data stored on disk, B-trees.  Actually there are several important, that is, relatively fast, algorithms for manipulating trees.<p>Early on in computing there were more problems with algorithms that improved running time, e.g., string searching.<p>There is a general technique, <i>dynamic programming</i>, that is the basis of several important, relatively fast algorithms. Here the <i>programming</i> is in the sense of the English project <i>planning</i>, that is, from the field of <i>optimization</i> in <i>operations research</i>.<p>Generally, given a program, it can be difficult to do algebraic manipulations, say, assuming either random or worst case inputs, to find the &quot;Big O&quot; running time.  Knuth&#x27;s book starts with a lot of algebraic techniques that can help finding Big O running times.  That work can be as challenging as we please.<p>There is some work that early on was not really in computer science but very much needs computers and where running time was and is a huge issue.  An important source of such work was optimization in operations research.  The first work of concern was the simplex algorithm of linear programming.  Next was the closely related integer linear programming, i.e., combinatorial optimization.  There were too many cases of problems starting with n numbers and running in<p>O(2^n)<p>which is <i>exponential</i> and so bad that, for too many realistic problems, we could run for billions of years with about the fastest computers we can imagine and big enough to fill the visible universe, literally.<p>So, a question became, can we have some positive integer k and have worst case running time grow only as<p>O(n^k)<p>that is, a polynomial in k?  The problem was generalized and now is the question of P versus NP, the leading question in computational complexity and maybe in much of computer science and pure and applied mathematics.  The standard example of such a problem is the traveling salesman problem were we are given some n cities and ask for the shortest path that visits each city exactly once.<p>That&#x27;s a nutshell start on <i>computational time complexity</i> in computer science."

Technical design interviews where you are given a high level problem and discuss how you would architect the solution.

Structured behavioral interviews, ask a series of &quot;Tell me about a time when you disagreed with a coworker, how did you resolve the issue?&quot;. This style is extremely popular in non-tech fields, so there is pressure that we get more of them in tech as well.

In an emergency the user could simply drive home to get it.<p>If you’re already thinking SSD, it’s probably not that much data. Then they don’t need to do anything other than set it up once. I think your plan of having them transport it to the office once a week has the same flaw you already mentioned (any effort needed on their part and it doesn’t happen).

Especially notable is the seven-volume work &quot;The Art of Computer Programming&quot; by Donald Knuth; in particular the volumes &quot;Fundamental Algorithms&quot;, &quot;Sorting and Searching&quot;, and &quot;Seminumerical Algorithms&quot; are timeless masterpieces, entertaining and witty, and they totally nail their subject-matter.

However, with a space capsule we want to maximise drag to slow down for a safe landing. The blunt capsule design was first proposed by Harvey Julian Allen in 1953 at NASA Ames research centre. It had two advantages—not only the high drag needed to reduce speed but also the blunt shape, which resulted in the shock wave detaching from the surface of the vehicle. This helped to reduce the very high temperatures (around 1,648°C for the space shuttle nose) from directly contacting the surface, which would otherwise melt.“</i><p>(That page has a photo of the shock waves around a Soyuz during recently)"

Same can&#x27;t be said for other fields, there are definitely great minds in other fields, but there are almost no bound to the bad apples and you might end up dealing with those people much more regularly [In addition to not working in something as interesting as programming, but that probably only applies to me and not you].

Even just gathering a complete list of all addresses owned and potentially used by someone like Google (for YouTube) and keeping that up to date might prove difficult. So if you still wanna do that it might be simpler to just turn the VPN on whether you need it. If it&#x27;s just about browsing though a provider that offers a browser plugin might do the trick on a per-tab basis.<p>What might work for you is having a dedicated VM for the VPN that is constantly tunneled, so just use that one whenever you want to visit some blocked site."

2019-08-18,"I think you may benefit from thinking more concretely about what you want to do. It is one thing to say &quot;not-programming&quot; - which is very broad, so broad that it is not terribly helpful - and quite another to say &quot;I&#x27;d like to make a living as a jazz musician&quot; or &quot;a biology researcher&quot; or any number of other things. Start there: what do you want to run <i>towards</i>, rather than what you are running <i>away</i> from.<p>Second, there are many possible career paths which are adjacent to programming, and which would use your technical skills, but not as part of your day-to-day. This could be project management, product management, technical writing, or even engineering people management. As before, if you have an idea of a <i>specific</i> function in your organization that you would find interesting, and which would make use of your talents as a programmer, then this may be an easier route than starting from scratch.<p>When it comes to any of these functions, my advice would be to: (1) Find small ways to demonstrate your interest in aptitude for those skills. For example, work with your product manager to write a product brief (&quot;Hey, can I take a crack at it and ask for your feedback? I&#x27;d love to learn how to do this kind of thing.&quot;) And, (2) if you are able, express to your current manager that you&#x27;d be interested in learning additional skills and possibly making a - deliberate, smooth - career transition.<p>If you pursue a degree - be it in business, or any other field - realize that you would likely be competing for jobs with others who have 10 years of experience in the field, rather than new college hires. This is not an impossible thing! But this does require a strong narrative, and your ability to articulate why you made a career change and what specifically you can offer based on your previous work experience in the unrelated field.<p>My overall point would be to really take some time to sketch out what you would want to do (in the affirmative), why it is interesting to you, and how specifically (not in a hand-wavy sense, but &quot;here is a specific task that I could do more effectively and here is why&quot;) your current skills would have a multiplier effect on your new path.<p>Best of luck to you!"

Unless your friend is a natural born comp. scientist, she&#x27;ll need someone to point out what&#x27;s important, what&#x27;s not, which exercises she must solve before moving on and which topics she can take in parallel if she needs a break.<p>Of course, a course takes time.

Get them browsing&#x2F;connecting to the server and then pull the plug (ethernet&#x2F;wifi) on the server. Then they will see the connection.<p>Have the students deface their school website with developer tools. That will also go down well I&#x27;m sure.<p>I guess I am saying keep it simple.

But the following observations might help:<p>Basically write two versions, one from a user perspective, i.e. what problem does it address and how does it solve it; the other from an implementation perspective, i.e. diagramming the major blocks and how they communicate with one another.  Ideally, all of these being referenced back to the user perspective.<p>Finally, I find it useful to write a marketing plan, one that identifies the target demographic, their attributes and a SWOT &#x2F; competitive products &#x2F; markets analysis.<p>Sometimes I feel that I am a hybrid of a technical writer and devil&#x27;s advocate to my clients."

SQL will handle 3 mil rows in a snap. If you are transforming the contents of the cells then R is potentially nicer, but if you are mainly summarizing, grouping, subsetting, etc SQL is fast and readable and you can “dump” a CSV that’s fast to read in R or Stata. Your R or Stata code will be really short, really just a load step, a viz &#x2F; pretty tables step, and then a model run step.

Streaming services provide a convenient solution to this problem, but lack context (and often content).<p>The growing archive demands we build a narrative. Think of your favourite artists; who were their influences, contemporaries, collaborators? All of this information is readily accessible. Look for side projects, collaborations, interviews, and retrospective articles. Context provides innumerable clues for where to go next. A few clicks and you can find yourself in new worlds, but also understand something of how you arrived there. A small selection of well-researched artists can blossom into a constellation given time, and new music will appear in multitudes."

2019-08-17,I used Spotify for a while but was never happy with their discover playlists. When Apple Music came out I used the trial to see if their discover (New For You) playlists was better. It&#x27;s far from perfect but I found it better than Spotify.<p>I also live in an area with absolutely garbage local radio stations and a lot of cell phone dead areas so I have SiriusXM. You have to stay away from the pop channels (including the decade-specific channels and popular rock&#x2F;hip hop channels) but on the fringe channels you can find some interesting music. From the app you can pivot what you&#x27;ve found into a Pandora playlist.<p>SomaFM is also pretty good beyond their more popular ambient playlists.

2019-08-17,"Business model canvas is the best I&#x27;ve seen for this. It&#x27;s designed to be really easy to iterate, and identify what parts link to other parts.<p>If you&#x27;re writing for engineers, it&#x27;s still similar - what is the problem and how does this solve it?<p>I&#x27;ve done a few startups, and so far we&#x27;ve never really needed a technical product spec to hit project market fit. Partly because it&#x27;s usually far better than the competition, e.g. a native app with lots of features vs a static competitor app built in phonegap.<p>Partly because it&#x27;s intuitive but hard to put into words. We had a health recipe app. One of the most used features was a BMI calculator. I couldn&#x27;t explain why we needed it, but it was half an hour to build (with unit tests!) and a chat with one customer said she had our app and the competitor&#x27;s app because the competitor app had a BMI calculator. It would literally take less time to build it than write a spec for it.<p>The other questionable feature was a dodgy in app chat. It wasn&#x27;t live, more like a single thread message board. Customers loved it and it provided most of our feedback. We ended up branching some WhatsApp groups from it instead of building a full thing. Part of the reason is that people use a healthy recipe app to commit to losing weight, and they wanted some company. Especially those who had unsupportive husbands and family. Or those who didn&#x27;t know where to start.<p>So to reinforce, you have an idea of what the problem is, and what it looks like when it&#x27;s solved. You should also have a feedback funnel early on to see how you&#x27;re doing, though this more face to face with customers rather than an engineering thing."

Does it fall under the same rules and restrictions of a standard breathalyzer?<p>- How rigorously are you testing for false positives? Can you tell someone who has taken drugs but they have worn off vs someone who is currently high?<p>- Will you be making your data open source? Companies that sell proprietary technology to police departments can notoriously complicate legal cases when they do not disclose technical limitations or the possibilities of false positives or negatives.<p>- Will you be restricting your product sales only to regions where marijuana is already legal?

2019-08-16,There is a reason why online education is so cheap when compared to traditional schools.<p>The reason is very simple. Most people don&#x27;t have the discipline to finish. It&#x27;s just too easy to quit. You can try this or you can try that but ultimately you won&#x27;t get past a few courses if any. I can almost guarantee that a few years from now you&#x27;ll still have the same problem of not being able to finish.<p>Bite the bullet and find a regular school where you&#x27;ll be accountable and are pushed to finish. And use the online courses as supplements. At least you&#x27;ll start moving in the right direction. We hear about students that bitch about their large student debt. That&#x27;s just the price of not having elite level self control to do it online. So their debt is well worth the fact that they have an education.<p>One possibility is to volunteer to do something you want to learn. That might force you to complete something in order to deliver it.

* D&amp;I - current ratio of m&#x2F;f, or minorities on the team you would be working with, what&#x27;s that ratio in management, is there a plan in place to encourage outreach

Reading this thread has popped up some questions in my mind and I&#x27;m curious to hear thoughts:<p>Why do we (aka society aka the police) test for specific substance quantities at all?  Really, I think, what we care about is whether someone is able to competently perform the task of driving at a given moment.<p>If you are unable to perform that task, then you should be removed from the road (and, possibly, punished).<p>Frankly, I don&#x27;t really care whether you&#x27;re drunk, high, tired, distracted from texting or even if you&#x27;re just a plain &#x27;ol bad driver.  The net result is the same - you&#x27;re an increased risk to others on (and off) the road and your risk should be mitigated.<p>This gets to the root of a number of related issues - the fact that different bodies react to different levels of chemicals in different ways, etc. etc.<p>If you&#x27;re able to function at a given moment, fine by me.  If your driving is compromised for whatever reason (as demonstrated by a field sobriety test), then off the road you go.<p>Thoughts &#x2F; corrections &#x2F; slap-downs?"

Can you get something similar to a BAC with it? Also how often&#x2F;likely is it that a false positive will happen? More importantly I fear that the &quot;Cannabis Breathalyzer&quot; will become like a polygraph, which can&#x27;t tell whether your actually lying or not, but is merely used as a tool by police that&#x27;s used against people. Comparing Alcohol to Cannabis also isn&#x27;t right. These are <i>vastly</i> different chemicals with different effects on people. Over ~10000 people died in 2017 from alcohol impaired driving[0], can anything remotely similar be said of Cannabis? Don&#x27;t get me wrong driving under the influence of any drug can be dangerous, and is why on most prescription bottles you&#x27;ll have a &quot;Do not operate heavy machinery&quot; warning on it, but that doesn&#x27;t stop everyone on medication from driving. Prohibiting Cannabis has caused much grief in the past that this tool, without accurate results and proper use, is likely going to cause more harm than good.

2019-08-16,I&#x27;m skeptical that ppm of THC correlates to &quot;Highness&quot; as well as ppm of alcohol correlates to drunkeness.
2019-08-16,"Just the fact that you will be profiting off of this perceived issue, means you have some interest in the root causes of impaired driving remaining unsolved. Reading statements like this just tells me you have dollar signs in your eyes:<p>&gt; we&#x27;re imagining a world where there are one of our devices in every police car in North America<p>Nowhere did I see a sentiment akin to this:<p>&gt; we&#x27;re imagining a world where people act more responsibly, driving deaths are reduced, etc<p>I think it would go a long way towards establishing more credibility and goodwill on your part if you pledged a not-insignificant % of revenue (not just profit) towards education, mental health and&#x2F;or civil rights efforts. At the end of the day, it is all citizens&#x27; tax dollars that will be used to pay you, so you should do the right thing and make those dollars work for them.<p>You should show that you&#x27;re actually using this as a step towards eradicating the root cause, not just profiting off of the perceived problem. Probably the best way for something like this to show it has helped society is if it ultimately obviates its own raison d&#x27;être, because the problem has been solved and thus the need for your palliative has vanished.<p>It&#x27;s like a doctor prescribing opiates vs solving the underlying issue of a patient&#x27;s pain, or psychiatric patients hooked on antidepressants. I&#x27;m sure there were plenty of execs dreaming of every pharmacy stocked with Oxy. These things may be helpful, but only as a step towards solving the underlying issue. When they become the end goal, people get hurt."

2019-08-16,"I&#x27;ve been a daily cannabis user for over a decade. I have a prescription for this, like millions of others with prescriptions for psychoactive medications without driving limitations. Would you send someone to prison for driving because they took their Adderall that morning? Cannabis is not like alcohol in regard to impairment of motor function and decision-making under the influence. Surely the same concentrations of particulate correlate to different levels of impairment in different individuals. Of course it is possible for individuals to be impaired by cannabis to the extent that driving would be dangerous. There are many factors. I&#x27;m wary of a device that purports to determine actions as dangerous based on the the measure of some particulate in the breath."
2019-08-16,"It sounds nice in theory but at such minute levels, you&#x27;re going to have tons of noise and variation from individual to individual.

2019-08-16,"I don&#x27;t understand the negativity in many of the comments here. I&#x27;m all for legalization of marijuana, but I actually think that the inability to test for people driving high is a very reasonable argument <i>against</i> legalization. I generally feel that people should be able to make their own choices, but not if those choices involve driving a 3000 pound piece of metal down the highway while impaired.<p>Yes, we need to be certain that this isn&#x27;t giving false positives. But if anything, this is step towards <i>more</i> legalization efforts on the whole (and fewer people driving high)."

2019-08-16,"Lots of talk about the consequences of false positives.<p>I understand the market for these devices is partly law enforcement. But another commercial market is devices installed in cars for habitual offenders. For alcohol detectors, something like half a million are installed in cars in America right now.<p>They have false positives, sure. Users learn to avoid substances that will trigger a false positive, because they want to drive their car. Its a massive inconvenience, but instead of a jail term, they are back at work etc driving their car."

2019-08-16,"Great job to the founders, awesome to see more cool companies out of the UW nano program.<p>Curious why all the negativity, perhaps people are unaware that cannabis actively DOES impair driving to dangerous levels. Also, as this startup is from Canada I&#x27;m almost certain the mindframe of the founders is to develop a device that makes legalization EASIER, not allowing police to use it catch and arrest people on the street who they think are high.<p>One issue we have been dealing with in Canada is how to regulate driving after consuming cannabis. A zero tolerance policy for smoking + driving within <i>days</i> is unreasonable and thus will be ineffective. This device and the research behind it looks like could help regulators and police catch people who are dangerously high while not arresting those who happened to smoke much earlier."
2019-08-16,"I think this is really cool.<p>I always wondered though, the way we correlate numbers to driving ability seems sketchy. Some people take multiple large dabs of cannabis concentrate - and they&#x27;re barely feeling it. This is because they basically do this all day every day.<p>Someone like that would fail this test, despite their motor skills remaining near baseline.<p>It&#x27;s clearly different for alcohol, because it directly increases &quot;network latency&quot; (if you will) of motor control and sensory inputs.<p>So ultimately I would like a push to improve roadside driving ability testing, regardless of suspected substance use. This covers sleepiness, dehydration, etc."
2019-08-16,"Depends on the job, the reason why you can&#x27;t meet and other context. Currently, I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s disrespectful since it&#x27;s pretty normally accepted for jobs that don&#x27;t REQUIRE a physical presence. But if it&#x27;s just a matter of not wanting to meet someone just because, then yes, it might be disrespectful."
2019-08-16,"&gt;A similarly impairing dose of cannabis results in 0.00001 ppm<p>Yeah this isn&#x27;t going to work. The detection threshold is so low it&#x27;s gonna go off if someone is smoking weed within 500 feet. There will be so many false positives it will practically be a divining rod.<p>Police already abuse sniffer dogs frequently, we shouldn&#x27;t allow them to use another unreliable tool to arrest people."

2019-08-15,"It amazes me people still actually do this. Why would you, in 2019, not just ask a person to bring their laptop with their preferred development environment set up on it and ask them to solve some basic coding exercises there instead.<p>Physically writing code with a marker on a wall seems akin to asking a mechanic applying for a job to demonstrate their skill at repairing cars by performing a &#x27;repair&#x27; on a miniature car made of lego bricks.<p>Edit: one thing I noticed once I started having candidates work on their own laptop was a) some very unqualified people slipped through the screen and this can be obvious when they have no programming tools on their personal machine and b) you can learn a lot quickly from seeing someone use their own machine -- you get a clean signal if they are adept at using their text editor, git, build tools, etc, without risk of a contrived setup making it a false negative."
2019-08-15,"FreeBSD doesn&#x27;t have as much funding, resources as Linux and therefore is always behind on various things. This pushes people to switch to Linux for one reason or another even if initially they were using FreeBSD and also pushes software developers to neglect FreeBSD, not providing proper support and giving even more reasons to switch.

2019-08-15,"Whiteboard interviews would be great if they tested the kind of things that we would do on a whiteboard, namely design and _maybe_ pseudocode.  If someone is interviewing for an algorithm job, I&#x27;d expect they could write text in boxes that might describe how the algorithm works.  If someone is interviewing for a front end position, I&#x27;d expect that they could draw some boxes describing the UI, and depending on the underlying technology maybe add the info on the containers and subwindows, or describing the MVC model, or high level actions drawn with arrows that show what gets affected if some button or UI item is pressed or selected.  If someone is being hired for a networking job, then I might expect to draw up some boxes that show a topology for some scenario and identify where the security structures might need to be.  For a straight-up programming job, maybe I could see drawing flow charts or sequence diagrams or something that might actually be useful to draw out.  I would certainly not expect to write code on a whiteboard.  That&#x27;s not what whiteboards are for."

The very worst is just a pretext to cover up the interviewers biases.<p>In my experience, the right company is out there for you, but as an older candidate it can take waiting a long time for the right opportunity where you can highlight the specific skills you&#x27;ve spent your life accumulating."

2019-08-15,"1) Hey HN peeps - I&#x27;m disappointed in the number of people that are either not addressing the actual question, or are simply offering speculation.  I&#x27;m not angry, just disappointed.<p>2) On the USTPO.gov site I found the following:<p>&gt; What is the difference between TM and the R within the circle ®?<p>&gt; Use of the TM and SM symbols may be governed by local, state, or foreign laws and the laws of a pertinent jurisdiction to identify the marks that a party claims rights to. The federal registration symbol, the R enclosed within a circle, may be used once the mark is actually registered in the USPTO. Even though an application is pending, the registration symbol may not be used before the mark has actually become registered.<p>&gt; The federal registration symbol should only be used on goods or services that are the subject of the federal trademark registration.<p>&gt; PLEASE NOTE: Several foreign countries use the letter R enclosed within a circle to indicate that a mark is registered in that country. Use of the symbol by the holder of a foreign registration may be proper.<p>And also:<p>&gt; Do federal regulations govern the use of the designations &quot;TM&quot; or &quot;SM&quot; or the ® symbol?<p>&gt; If you claim rights to use a mark, you may use the &quot;TM&quot; (trademark) or &quot;SM&quot; (service mark) designation to alert the public to your claim of a &quot;common-law&quot; mark. No registration is necessary to use a &quot;TM&quot; or &quot;SM&quot; symbol and you may continue to use these symbols even if the USPTO refuses to register your mark. Those symbols put people on notice that you claim rights in the mark, although common law doesn&#x27;t give you all the rights and benefits of federal registration.<p>&gt; You may only use the federal registration symbol &quot;®&quot; after the USPTO actually registers a mark, not while an application is pending. And it may only be used on or in connection with the goods&#x2F;services listed in the federal trademark registration and while the registration is still alive (you may not continue to use it if you don&#x27;t maintain the registration or it expires). Although there are no specific requirements on where the symbol should be placed relative to the mark, most businesses use the symbol in the upper right corner of the mark. Note: Because several foreign countries use &quot;®&quot; to indicate that a mark is registered in that country, use of the symbol by the holder of a foreign registration may be proper.<p>So, in the U.S., it appears there is no federal NEED to use these marks, aside from being able to say that any infringer can&#x27;t claim ignorance of your claim, BUT that still leaves any state, county, local, or other nation usages unanswered."

2019-08-15,"If you&#x27;re writing code on a whiteboard in an interview, syntax, library calls, etc, should not at all be part of the evaluation process. You dodged a bullet on that one.<p>Being able to &quot;get the recursive solution fast enough&quot;? Depends a lot on the expectations, might or might not be an eliminating criterion. Definitely a problem e.g. for functional-heavy environments, where that style of reasoning is expected to be your bread and butter.<p>In the general case, I&#x27;ve seen fairly senior developers crash and burn on basic programming interviews (be they on a whiteboard, on a laptop, or whatever other format) due to genuinely weak programming skills, so I don&#x27;t agree with the assumption that some candidates are &quot;above&quot; these interviews.<p>Also, a lot of seemingly pointless questions are good questions phrased wrong. E.g. I will never ask you to implement depth-first tree traversal on a whiteboard, but will ask to pretty print a directory structure, and make a note of whether a candidate notices this actually _is_ depth-first traversal dressed up as a practical day-to-day problem.<p>Of course, just because the interview format is not fundamentally flawed doesn&#x27;t mean that plenty of companies don&#x27;t mess up implementing it in practice...<p>Then again, your PSes suggest you don&#x27;t want a reasoned discussion so much as you just needed to get that off your chest, which is fair enough."
2019-08-15,"Beyond whiteboard based coding being a bad medium, on-the-spot programming exercises are a super noisy, poor medium for assessment compared to the alternative: a work sample in the form of a 4-8 hour programming exercise done by the person on their own terms. No exploding deadline, no restrictions on tools other than those necessary to show the person&#x27;s relevant job skills. Make a bunch of them, put the time into them, and let the candidate have a chance to pick from a library of exercises that are interesting and fun to do.<p>The main downside to a work sample is that a lot of people will say they simply don&#x27;t have the time to do it. That&#x27;s fine, you&#x27;ll lose some people, but you&#x27;ll also have people applying who really want to work for the company. From there, you&#x27;ll have a small number of people who do a great job on it. By the time they are in your office interviewing, the idea that you&#x27;d reject them because of a slip-up on a small coding exercise on a whiteboard is absurd, because you already have a mountain of evidence regarding their skills as a programmer. The in-interview exercises will be there to test other skills like communication and collaboration, not writing good programs."
2019-08-15,"I think it depends entirely on what you want from it. I utilise social media professionally, and my articles on LinkedIn have certainly opened some doors. Among the most noticeably was when I was awarded the great honour of working on a few of our national strategies for digitalisation. Social media can certainly do that, and beyond influence it can also make you an attractive hire.<p>I don’t think I’ve ever had a conversation without underlying motives on any social media platform that puts your name one it though. People are always pushing some agenda, and that’s perfectly fine, if that’s what you’re there for. We often get involved, buy products or hire people partly because of networking through social media ourselves. So I think social media can serve a purpose professionally.<p>I don’t think there is a lot of value in social media when it comes to getting inspired though, and the shorter the format the worse it gets. It’s certainly a great platform for FOMO, have you learned Rust yet? Heh, but in terms of real world value I think it almost always falls short. Take the Rust hype, it’s probably a really great language, but I haven’t seen a single Rust job pop-up on any job-agent for my entire country in 2019. Which means the hype and talk around Rust is relatively useless for most developers. In those cases I think it’s much better to turn your FOMO into JOMO and just work on things that interest you.<p>Hell, even when you’re successful professionally with Social Media, it is mostly standing at the box in speakers corner. No one really listens unless you say something they can benefit from by retweeting."

2019-08-15,"You’re suspicions and frustrations are valid and are based on your experience alone. No one else here was in those interview rooms with you and if you subconsciously picked up on the presence of an age bias you probably weren’t pulling it out of thin air. In my experience in multiple industries as both interviewer and interviewee I’ve felt similar biases and often had them inarguably confirmed. And I’m somewhat ashamed to say that I’ve partially acted on such biases as well in rare cases. Interviewees deserve better treatment and more transparency, period. No one should have the right to exert that kind of toxic power dynamic on a fellow professional. I’m 32 in a new workplace in SF and I can already feel the subtle force of ageism lurking in the subtext of interactions with coworkers. I appreciated this post, thank you for speaking out on this. PS I love white-boarding."
2019-08-15,"I don&#x27;t have a problem with whiteboarding, I collaborate with teammates all the time to design rough sketches and even bits of code on the whiteboard. The only critism I would have is if the interviewer is overly strict on things like syntax and API names.<p>White boarding questions should be related to the fundamentals of computer science and programming. Trees, hashes and arrays have been and will be around forever, it&#x27;s fair game in an interview setting."
2019-08-15,"The way I see it, hosting them on your personal website portrays them like a portfolio. If they have potential to grow into something on their own you may want to consider giving them their own website to keep it modular.

You don&#x27;t officially need to file anything. HOWEVER, if you end up in court against someone with a registered trademark, you&#x27;ll likely lose unless you can establish &quot;prior art&quot;. Prior art means you&#x27;ve used the trademark <i>in commerce</i> prior to the date they did."
2019-08-15,"A suggestion that I also proposed to the Monica&#x27;s founder (with no reply, though) - make it possible to organize contacts around interests. In real life there almost always is some kind of common interest that you share with people - computer games, politics, cars, cooking, whatever. However with different people you have different shared interests."
2019-08-15,"Some of the most impressive whiteboard&#x2F;coderpad performances I’ve seen have been from middle aged candidates. When someone has been using a language for 15+ years, their agility and fluency in expressing their algorithmic ideas in code is incredible. Most candidates seem to understand and articulate a solution by the end of the interview, but it’s the fluent ones who can prove it with end to end working code."
2019-08-15,"I tend to avoid places that whiteboard, the one time I did have to do it I sucked it up only because a friend stuck their neck out to get me the interview. I was told syntax didn&#x27;t have to be perfect. Yeah I think they may come up with stupid excuses basically to not hire you.<p>Honestly, interviews go two ways: you figure out if you <i>really</i> want to work there, and they do as well. If they don&#x27;t want you, assume it&#x27;s for the best, you would of had to deal with worse: coworkers who hate your personality or have a toxic personality."
2019-08-15,"I&#x27;m even older than you and have no problem with using a whiteboard during interviews.  That said, interviewers who get hung up about precise syntax are poor interviewers and need coaching.  Or are just looking for an excuse to ding someone.  More to the point, I don&#x27;t see how asking to put answers to technical questions on a whiteboard favors younger people over older people."

2019-08-15,"If we stipulate that whiteboard interviews might be useful for evaluating candidates in some cases, a good whiteboard interview would have specific criteria expressed in some sort of rubric or other document.  That document would be shared with the candidate and evaluator(s) in advance of the interview.  This ensures that the candidate and evaluators have a shared notion of what constitutes success before the interview.  An opaque process, unfortunately, can cultivate the type of suspicion that you&#x27;re expressing here.  It sounds like your whiteboard interviews did not give you a good sense of the types of skills they were looking to evaluate during the interview.<p>I think it&#x27;s great that you have such high self-esteem and aren&#x27;t doubting yourself just because some other people don&#x27;t see your value.  That said, I think more data is needed before concluding that whiteboard interviews in general are tantamount to an age filter.<p>Edit: please note that I have said &quot;if we stipulate,&quot; not &quot;if we accept as an a priori truth&quot; that whiteboard interviews are good.  It&#x27;s simply a rhetorical device for evaluating whether or not your whiteboard interview is at risk for evaluator bias."

My 7 year old Daughter loves it!<p>The lessons are presented as an animated comic book where the characters are cute little monsters learning math concepts. In addition to the online app, there is both a physical version of the Lesson Book and Practice Book for each grade level -- which in turn is sub-divided into 4 parts (eg. 2nd Grade --&gt; 2A, 2B, 2C, 2D).<p>One point worth bringing up is that this is a product produced by The Art of Problem Solving, which is very much involved in Math Olympiad competition prep. So, the material can get challenging quickly. They are doing basic algebra in the 2nd grade level and in beginning of the 3rd grade level they are doing material that I never saw until HS Geometry.<p>All of that being said, I find the curriculum design and method of building mathematical intuition and number sense vastly superior to anything I ever experienced myself in school. I studied math in university and work as a Data Scientist and ML Engineer and I am learning from her lessons as well :)<p>I would recommend beginning with the level 2A regardless of your daughter&#x27;s existing skills. The first concept that is covered is place value and you spend the bulk of the first book&#x2F;level rolling this concept over and inspecting it from every conceivable angle. It&#x27;s hard to overstate how really groking place value is foundational to almost all other math that kids will do in school; Beast Academy does an exceptionally thorough job of covering it.<p>My daughter thinks it is tons of fun and I don&#x27;t have to do anything to get her to do the lessons or materials -- she just wants to do it on her own. I should also add that my daughter has never had a negative view of math, so I cannot say with confidence that my N=1 observation will generalize.<p>Best of luck!"

2019-08-15,"I&#x27;m a bit older than OP - just recently turned 46. I&#x27;ve been a software engineer (professionally) since I was 18 years old when I was first hired by a small mom-n-pop shop.<p>One would think I could simply plop my resume down, do an in-person interview, show a bit of code I&#x27;ve written in the past, plus my github, and that&#x27;d be enough. Alas, it isn&#x27;t.<p>I&#x27;ve had good interviews that used a whiteboard, and bad ones that did. Overall, though, I detest whiteboard &quot;challenges&quot; and I specifically avoid them. Currently, with my use of recruiters, I tell them specifically not to send me to such interviews if they use a whiteboard (it would have to be something really unique for me to consider it - maybe for a ground-floor startup opp, or something in robotics or AI, etc).<p>The best interview I had that used a whiteboard was basically where they asked me to write fizzbuzz whiteboard style. Whenever I am given such a task (ie - write code), I ask the interviewer if they mind if I use &quot;pseudocode&quot; - just to get the whole &quot;wrong syntax or keyword&quot; issue out of the way. I&#x27;ve never had a turn-down from this ask. I liked that they wanted me to show I could do fizzbuzz &quot;from memory&quot; because it would show I wasn&#x27;t copying&#x2F;pasting from that github repo of &quot;all versions of fizzbuzz&quot;, and it would also show I had some idea about programming. After that, and the in-person portion of the interview, they gave me a take-home challenge to write some piece of small software (IIRC, it was a random-number dice game or something), and upload it to their system for evaluation. I actually ended up getting an offer of a position from that job, but I ended up taking a different position with another company.<p>The worst whiteboard interview I had, though, felt like a complete grilling session. It started off reasonable enough; ushered into a large conference room, and I was questioned by a couple of programmers on their team, plus their hiring manager. All seemed ok. They asked me to do some whiteboard work - some SQL coding IIRC, among other things - all was going ok as I was writing down an answer, but every time I turned around to the interviewers - there were more people in the room. By the end of it all, it felt like the entire staff of the company was in that room and nobody was out doing their job. Had to be 20 or 30 people in there. To be honest, it rattled me - mainly because it was so odd.<p>I didn&#x27;t get an offer on that job - and to this day, I am glad I didn&#x27;t. While the company and the office location all had a &quot;hip and upcoming&quot; startup-like vibe, plus open-office floor plan, etc - at the same time, I wondered why they had such a large SWE team (10+ people from what I recall) for what was essentially a basic PHP CRUD application.<p>It was interesting to note OP&#x27;s idea of it being a potential age filter; I&#x27;m not sure I agree with that fully. I wonder if it isn&#x27;t meant as more of a filter for those who didn&#x27;t go to school to learn the craft. I mean, I&#x27;ve probably done at least once certain things being asked for - but if they couch them in terms that are &quot;defined in the literature&quot; (this also covers asking about &quot;patterns&quot;) - I&#x27;ll most likely be lost. Because I don&#x27;t know all of that terminology, or what it applies to. I&#x27;ve been coding in some fashion or another since I was 10 years old, but I haven&#x27;t gone to school for it (aside from a couple of community college classes for C&#x2F;C++ - algorithms and&#x2F;or patterns were not discussed).<p>If so, it&#x27;s kinda on them because they didn&#x27;t read my resume carefully; I note up-front that I don&#x27;t have that education, that I am a self-learner, and that I don&#x27;t like to be a &quot;specialist&quot; in a particular language or framework-du-jour. Rather, I&#x27;m a business problem solver - the ultimate choice of how that problem is solved is an implementation detail that has only a certain bearing on the problem solution. Mainly, it&#x27;s better to come up with a solution and then choose a language for the specifics of that solution that will work to implement it. 9&#x2F;10 times you don&#x27;t need the latest language or framework for most problems. It&#x27;s more knowing when you do, rather than just picking one and sticking with it forever (ie - I don&#x27;t want to become someone mired in only using and knowing COBOL). Likely, any problems that crop up in a solution tend to do with how the solution was implemented, not what language&#x2F;framework it was implemented in.<p>Lastly - something I have noted post-interview is the fact that seemingly none of the potential employers care to contact or do contact any references you give them. You can ask them if they want&#x2F;need references, but even those that do, never follow up on them. I am not sure why this doesn&#x27;t happen - maybe it&#x27;s just a simple constraint of time vs number of resumes&#x2F;interviews? Or maybe it&#x27;s due to past candidates gaming the system, and making it an unreliable metric to the process?"

2019-08-15,We just had a project in our app to <i>remove</i> these. We had lists of credit card names and they&#x27;d be ridiculous things like &quot;Company(TM) Product(R) VISA(TM) for Business(c)&quot; and the client had no idea which credit card was theirs because they signed up for &quot;Product for Business&quot;.<p>Our legal team agreed that in functional contexts (like picking a credit card name from a select box) we could omit the trademarks.

2019-08-15,"It&#x27;s important to consider whether your requirements include long-term retention and search of data, or only recent search and dashboards. Many of the open-source solutions such as Graylog-free or ELK don&#x27;t retain information long-term by default, so if long-term data retention is your goal, you should take that into account (Graylog offers it, but only for $$$).<p>On the other hand, if your primary use-case is near-term searches and reviews of data (e.g. &quot;we just need to see the last 90 days of information for troubleshooting and stats&quot;), you&#x27;ll be pleasantly surprised with the capabilities in both Graylog and ELK without the additional overhead of Splunk. I&#x27;ll say, too, that I found working with Filebeat for ingestion to be a lot easier and automation-friendly than working with Splunk forwarders—so much so that we&#x27;re basically adopting an &quot;only use Splunk for indexing&quot; approach to ingestion and using everything else to get data into it."
2019-08-15,"Similarly, I see web developers manually or automatically updating the (c) 2019 in the footer of Web pages.

2019-08-15,"I was very excited to try this. Particularly as a hypersocial super-connector, I&#x27;ve dreamed about my ideal personal CRM.<p>What I want is:<p>* The ability to do something like a spaced repetition with my contacts. If it proposes I connect with someone, and I&#x27;m like &quot;great&quot;, they stay high priority. Or I can snooze that contact for a little while or a long while. (There might be an orthogonal feature to track who is important but I only need infrequent contact with.)<p>* The ability to accurately search my contacts. e.g. Friends who are into crypto and art.<p>So I went all in on Dex for ten minutes and granted read permissions for my calendar + contacts and added the extension access to read and change data on all websites.<p>The results were pretty underwhelming. It showed me a handful of contacts scraped from Google, many of which I didn&#x27;t even recognize. I understand that this is perhaps I&#x27;m not much of an email guy, so I do know that a scrape of my Google contacts (or even my emails) will poorly reflect my social graph.<p>Here&#x27;s what I want:<p>* Scrape and import my contacts across all platforms. If you need to use a Chrome extension to read my Facebook activity (not the messages, but just the people involved), fine. If you want me to spend 20 minutes downloading Facebook exports that don&#x27;t include message text, or maybe screenshotting my message feed subjects for Facebook and Instagram and emailing them to you to OCR, to avoid you being liable for TOS breaking, fine.<p>* Auto-tag contacts, and allow me to update my tags.<p>* Auto-prioritize my contacts, and allow me to update the priorities.<p>Dex isn&#x27;t really what I need, but thank you. I appreciate you trying to solve this problem.<p>[edit: Give me a Chrome extension to take screenshots of pages with key information about my social graph, whenever I browse onto them, that will then find sensitive info like message text and black them over and then allow me to easily email them to you?]"

2019-08-15,"You can get some domain names for as little as $1&#x2F;year for niche TLDs, and if you&#x27;re willing to splurge a bit, you can get more generic ones for $8.

If they&#x27;re just pet projects, it&#x27;s no big deal, but if you&#x27;re intending to monetize them or want them to become durable brands, the sooner you get them a custom domain, the better."
2019-08-15,"Anyone can crash and burn in a situation like that, particularly since it sounds like they are putting too much emphasis on the wrong things.

2019-08-15,"In my experience, whiteboard interviews are absolutely a form of gatekeeping. Whether the firms know it or not, they are excluding candidates who would have succeeded in the role by including weird unrelated side content in the interview. As the OP rightly mentions, nothing you program on a whiteboard has any application once you are actually in the job. It can be incredibly frustrating to know that you can do the work of a job, but be denied because of an old superstitious test.<p>The only silver lining is that, ultimately, companies hire the candidates they interview for. If a company makes its hiring decisions based on trivia quizzing and whiteboards, they&#x27;ll ultimately produce software that reflects that. During my last big job search, I eventually started asking upfront if there was whiteboard coding in the interview. I don&#x27;t want to waste my time."

2019-08-15,"This is an interesting take. I&#x27;m in my forties, will&#x2F;hope to be a direct tech contributor for my full career, and definitely make sure to prepare well for whiteboard interviews. I find them fun to a degree, and I used to nail them in my youth...and still do well...<p>Still, the ageism take is interesting but I don&#x27;t like falling back to that kind of thinking b&#x2F;c it is counterproductive.<p>The evolution of my own performance in whiteboard interviews (and anecdotally what I&#x27;ve heard from other experienced developers) is interesting:<p>I don&#x27;t feel like it is directly due to age or cognitive change&#x2F;decline, but more to do with mastery&#x2F;experience.<p>As you get more experienced in this craft (as with others), one of the most important skills you learn is navigating _context_. After solving real world problems repeatedly, you move further away from the aseptic environs of academia&#x2F;learning and find that prioritization and contextual understanding is far more important to superior execution.<p>More explanation...<p>I was in an interview recently and got the typical line of puzzle coding questions. These puzzle questions are completely denuded of context (which is irritable to a professional practitioner). Or, rather, the context becomes not to solve a problem with a given set of <i>outcome</i> constraints (real world) ... but solve a problem and try to guess what the interviewer&#x27;s particular fetishes are and try to hit those.<p>Do you get the impression the interviewer has a fetish for OO solutions? You better angle on that or your going to get the ding. Do they want to see you pull out a cool data structure like a min heap? You better realize that right away and get there. Generally speaking, you can &quot;win&quot; in these types of interviews if you angle for big-O optimality (I&#x27;ve found).<p>I&#x27;ve interviewed this way, myself. But over time -- with experience -- I&#x27;ve found that this doesn&#x27;t really even correlate that well with outcome. I&#x27;ve interviewed and worked with people that absolutely nail these whiteboard problems but when you get them on the job, and with real world curveballs thrown at them, they freeze - either due to some issue of work ethic, psychological issue&#x2F;fear, or in the absence of <i>grades</i> they just can&#x27;t seem to make a move.<p>What I&#x27;ve found is interviewing with just a Q &amp; A style response and digging into the work they&#x27;ve done and finding out how much ownership they have taken in their past work, how much curiosity they show (for any given piece of tech, just ask and see how well they know it and can even teach it to you if you don&#x27;t know it), how much drive they have to get things not just done, but get them done well&#x2F;solidly. Then, pretty quickly I can tell you if we&#x27;ve got a good hire.<p>Conversely I&#x27;ve made hires where the candidate did not do so well in the whiteboard but proceeded to excel in the professional context.<p>Think about this: if you have a person that is curious and drives to build the thing well... imagine the day (and these days come but not so often) that they encounter some need for a difficult algorithm. What is this conscientious person going to do? They&#x27;re not going wing it and write a bad solution. They are going to go do their due diligence, their research, consult with their team members, and they&#x27;ll get the right solution. So, say they are not so great with coming up with a novel algo on their own. One, that&#x27;s a skill they can develop, but two -- it&#x27;s a skill that&#x27;s only needed in a few people on your team and then you&#x27;ll overcome those steps at the intermittent times that they come through.<p>Now of course this ^ way of interviewing requires a personal skillset in one&#x27;s self -- that is, you have to have a good work ethic, be intensely curious, very responsible, etc in order to recognize these same qualities in the candidate.<p>Unfortunately, I&#x27;ve found the industry dominates with &quot;smart people&quot; but who tend toward what I call a &#x27;philistinic&#x27; position. They lean way too much on their natural intelligence and use that as an excuse to not really grow their skillset. This is what some people call &#x27;expert beginners&#x27; and there are far more of these, ime, than truly skilled practitioners.<p>So -- back to the ageism thing. I think it&#x27;s less ageism and more an overall industry deficit. If we understood our work better and could produce more masters&#x2F;professionals then I&#x27;d think we&#x27;d see an increased valuing of experience.<p>Blaming it on ageism I think only deters us from getting there."

2019-08-15,"I think it&#x27;s a bit in between. FWIW, at 54 I&#x27;ve never failed a whiteboard interview, including at my current FAANG employer, so this is most certainly not sour grapes.<p>While not <i>deliberately</i> ageist, I think whiteboard interviews work out a bit that way. What can be tested in such an interview? Only a sampling of domain knowledge. It will tend to be a sample weighted toward the particular problems and algorithms that will be super-fresh in the minds of people still in or fresh out of school (usually because the interviewers themselves are). To someone older but still well versed in that domain, those <i>particular</i> details might have been crowded out by a thousand other things learned since. They might seem less familiar because of changes in language, notation, or idiom. Those same differences will also affect how the result is &quot;graded&quot; even if the candidate solves the problem quickly and well.<p>Whiteboard interviews also fail to measure other things such as ability to select algorithms or higher-level approaches, people or organizational skills, industry knowledge, or a developed &quot;instinct&quot; about what symptoms suggest what problems in the relevant kinds of code. As more weight is given to whiteboard skills, less weight is given to literally everything else.<p>As I said, I don&#x27;t think any of this <i>intentionally</i> disadvantages older workers, but it can have that effect without intention. It has never hurt me personally, but I have plenty of peers who I know beyond doubt could code rings around the people who interviewed them. They just couldn&#x27;t dance that particular dance well enough in that moment and got rejected. That&#x27;s a loss for the (potential) employer as well as for them."

In other words, don&#x27;t expect to get good outcomes by just giving interviewers a few seminars, then telling them to go at it. You&#x27;ll get the same level of interviewing as the level of teaching you get by doing the same thing to TA&#x27;s with no experience.<p>The biggest single issue I&#x27;ve seen in whiteboard interviews, is the interviewers being hyper focused on what they want to find, and not listening to what the candidate is saying."

I don’t pick jobs based on the interview process, I pick the companies I wanted to join and practice the skills needed to pass the interview. After 10 years in the industry my whiteboarding was always terrible until my last round of interviews where I decided to actually focus on it and I passed the interviews at Facebook and Google. My problem was that I could always solve the problems but I was too slow without the keyboard and the compiler to help. So I practiced writing code without those tools and got faster. I think if anything my experience helped, so I’ve come around on whiteboarding. It’s not perfect, but any good coder can learn it and the bar is not really that high."

In the early 1970s, Crumb&#x27;s lawyer started threatening lawsuits against anyone using the image without permission. Crumb and A.A. Sales, a producer of unlicensed Keep On Truckin&#x27; merchandise, reached a settlement of $750 for the past usage. But A.A. continued to sell unlicensed products after the settlement without paying additional license fees. In 1973, Crumb went to the U.S. Federal Court, and wound up in the courtroom of Judge Albert Charles Wollenberg, who had previously ruled against the Air Pirates. A.A. Sales claimed the work was in the public domain, because Crumb had not included the copyright symbol on the work, although he had in Zap #1 as a whole. The work was covered under the 1909 Copyright Act, and any omission of notice caused the work to be public domain. The drawing had appeared on the business card of Crumb&#x27;s publisher without the copyright symbol. Based on that, Wollenberg granted A.A. Sales&#x27; request for summary judgment and Keep On Truckin&#x27; became public domain. In 1977, the Ninth Circuit Court reversed that decision, and it returned to copyrighted status.</i><p>Perhaps it is the similar for trademarks.

IMO, the open offerings actually seem designed to make it impossible to improve&#x2F;contribute&#x2F;extend in a cost effective way.

If you&#x27;d like to audit it I might suggest using a Helm chart like this one[0] to deploy a full stack to a Kubernetes cluster. Even if you aren&#x27;t using k8s for production it&#x27;s a fast way to get a handle on it. You can deploy a test cluster easy on GKE quick for nearly no money. If that seems too inaccessible, there are a few good docker-compose[1] implementations too that can get you going right away.<p>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s quite ready for production, but we were already using Prometheus and Grafana so I was auditing Loki[2] and was pleasantly surprised.

It should never be that important to worry about the specific language semantics here due to the time limit. But again the interviewer is there to be impressed on how much the candidate knows about the intricate details of the language + data structure + algorithms all in 15 minutes which is nonsensical requirements for a typical software engineering role.<p>Frankly speaking, the interview dance in the tech-industry is an excuse to trip up candidates who have not practiced for more than 6-9 months on data structures and algorithms and the latest tools that everyone is adopting. It is so &#x27;broken&#x27; that interviewing at FAANG companies is an entire industry itself.<p>For them, whiteboarding like this is essentially trying to find a silver needle in the sky."

2019-08-15,"I&#x27;m going through this right now, with 26 years of professional experience and an undergrad degree in CompSci.<p>There are many problems with hiring.  Many.  And as with standardized testing in public schools, one problem is how to judge the capability of many people (applicants, in this case) in a reasonable time, ESPECIALLY when the judges may not be experts in all relevant topics.  The popular answer is to test against standards that are easy to measure.  In the end, the companies may end up with fewer false positives (hiring an idiot), but will accept the likelihood of having more false negatives (missing out on a good employee).<p>I don&#x27;t agree with this approach, but mainly because of more a fundamental reason.  The #1 reason that most hiring is broken nowadays is that it focuses on specific skills (often an unlikely&#x2F;unrealistic laundry-list of technologies) rather than focusing on the candidate&#x27;s ability to learn, think, and communicate.<p>Regarding filtering out older candidates, this is more a side effect of testing on topics that would be more familiar to more recent grads.  Likewise, if interviews included demonstrating how a candidate would choose between C#, Python, Ruby, Go, C++, Java, or Javascript for a given fantasy scenario, or when to choose between bare metal servers onsite or virtualized hardware onsite or managed or unmanaged cloud resources, younger and less experienced candidates would fail more than older ones.  They just don&#x27;t have enough experiences in different situations to know how to make these decisions (with an reasoning to back them up).<p>The practical reality that I see is that older developers just may not be worth the extra cost compared to younger, less experienced ones.  This will be especially true in many corporate environments where the more experienced, more senior dev will have higher expectations, want more authority and autonomy, and otherwise feel stymied by corporate drag.  If the older worker hasn&#x27;t ascended into management, they have little road left to travel.<p>What many of us older devs didn&#x27;t realize is the situation we would now be in.  At this point, we must forge our own paths - by starting a consulting business, forming a startup, building a SaaS or other income-generating product, etc.  It does little good to be angry at the system (since our complaints will absolutely not change anything)."

2019-08-15,"i wouldn&#x27;t take it too personally nor read too much into it. the whiteboard interview wants to extract signal ranging from &quot;make sure this person isn&#x27;t a complete n00b&#x2F;fraud&quot; to really relevant problems that should probably be eminently doable, depending on role. but due to a variety of factors it doesn&#x27;t do this very well. for many the biggest is social pressure where at least 1 person is completely watching you work, which is stressful if novel or you&#x27;re shy. or lack of familiar tooling, or whatever.<p>yes there are myriad better ways to extract this signal but, as the saying goes, you get to choose the game you play but not its rules. you&#x27;ve enumerated one option which is refusing whiteboard interviews, but you could also level up your whiteboard game without too too much effort. personally i don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s time to reach for malice after 2 failed attempts at something i&#x27;m inferring you haven&#x27;t done in awhile."
2019-08-15,Yesterday I read that Google actually decreases their expectations in the white boarding exercises for experienced hires because they realize the leetcoding techniques will not be as fresh in an experienced dev&#x27;s mind. The expectations are higher in regards to system design and resume questions. That seems to be fair imo.<p>Later in the material it said that they reject over 80% of people who make it onsite. The bar at FAANGs is just relatively high regardless what kind of role you are trying to get. My mentality is preparing for high bar whiteboard interviews best case lands a job at a FAANG and worst case makes it incredibly easier to land a job elsewhere at a company that doesn&#x27;t rely on whiteboarding or has a lower bar in general. That&#x27;s to say investing in whiteboard practice has little downside and has an acceptable time&#x2F;reward ratio given the results if you are even just ok at it. In terms of ageism whiteboarding is not required to filter older devs out. Resumes viewing can do that. Why would they waste 6+ hours of their expensive Sr. devs time to put someone through a pointless exercise? Serious candidates will commit the same 1-3 months of study whether they are 23 or 43.

2019-08-15,"There&#x27;s a basic truth about being a knowledge worker that most people don&#x27;t think about.  This truth holds for young, old, programmer and non-programmer alike.<p>If you want to stay relevant and fresh long term, you need to be continuously learning.  You can get away with not worrying about ongoing learning in the short term, say 8 years or less, but in the long term it&#x27;s going to catch up with you.<p>This is one key reason programmers tend to move to other careers or into management after 10+ years: it&#x27;s a lot of work to continuously learn. And worse than that, it&#x27;s uncomfortable and makes you feel dumb when you know you&#x27;re really smart and capable.  Learning to embrace that feeling of being dumb, of being a beginner, is key to growth.  And once you stop growing and learning, you start getting old.<p>For developers this means learning new languages, techniques, technologies, methodologies.  If we accept that this learning is going to be happening, then it&#x27;s not too much to ask that data structures and algorithms refreshers are part of this ongoing learning say 1 out of every 3 or 4 years.<p>Most engineers actually don&#x27;t do this, and just stick with what they&#x27;ve been doing for the most part.  Or just happen to passively learn whatever is rolling by them in the course of doing their job.<p>For engineering, there are actually tons of things that need to be studied that are technically not part of the job: writing skills, communication skills, math skills.  Sometimes these things help you even though they&#x27;re not part of the daily grind.  The same goes for algorithms and data structures.<p>Studying these things also sends a signal to your interviewer: you&#x27;re willing to go figure it out even when it&#x27;s not fun and not convenient.  As a hiring manager, I like that.  And we can debate whether it&#x27;s a good thing, but it is what the situation is at many places.  Plus, it&#x27;s fun to study a lot of it, so it&#x27;s a good option to get on the learning."

2019-08-14,"I personally am not a big lisper, but know others who are.  It&#x27;s not as cool among young people, but there&#x27;s a certain segment of those, mostly over 50, who will swear by lisp and build some pretty cool things in it.<p>1. It&#x27;s got a minimal core and is easy to implement.  This means it runs in many places.<p>2. Very, very easy to extend due to its treating code as data.  You can assemble your own language on top of the base you&#x27;re given with macros.  This is why it&#x27;s often recommended for building your first compiler.  By the time you&#x27;ve written a lisp program, you&#x27;re basically writing in a different dialect.<p>I think some people also use it for a challenge, or to make themselves think.  It&#x27;s very different from your normal C programming, or OO, or even other functional languages (even though it influenced many of them).  There&#x27;s a certain family of languages such as lisp, scheme, ocaml, ml, etc. which seem to appeal to those with a more academic bent and so some interesting stuff can be written in them."

2019-08-14,"For context, I&#x27;m a C++ and Python developer in my day job.  I&#x27;ve been writing code for about 20 years and create a lot of small projects based on my interests (simple games, 2d&#x2F;3d graphics, automation, web services, algorithm exploration, etc.).  In the past I would use C++, Python, Ada, Haskell, and Ruby for those projects, as well as briefly looking at OCaml, Prolog, Mercury, Dylan, Nim, and some others.<p>For the past few years I&#x27;ve been using Common Lisp (almost) exclusively for these projects, and even some scripting at work.  I have a couple projects in QuickLisp (a latitude&#x2F;longitude &lt;-&gt; UTM converter and an STL file reader), I help maintain st-json (though I&#x27;ve only merged one changeset ;-), and I&#x27;ve written bindings to Blend2D and ZBar (both on GitHub but not in QuickLisp yet).<p>For me, Lisp hits a sweet spot between high level features, performance, and interactive development that I haven&#x27;t found in any other language.<p>Here are some things I like about it:<p>* Interactive development<p>The Common Lisp mode for Emacs is fantastic.  There&#x27;s a REPL in the editor and it&#x27;s super easy to send code back and forth.  It&#x27;s very convenient to play with a function as you&#x27;re writing it - it&#x27;s like an interactive unit test.  When the function&#x27;s working, the test code can be copy&#x2F;pasted from the REPL into the unit tests.<p>Code navigation is also great.  Alt-. will jump to the source code for the function under the cursor, and since SBCL and all of the libraries I use are open source, it works for <i>everything</i>, even things that would be language keywords in other languages.<p>Other languges have REPLs, but Lisp emphasizes it much more than the others.  Haskell and Python have REPLs (ghci and Idle) but it&#x27;s rare for software written in them to include a REPL, shipping Lisp software will often have a REPL available - I can connect to the StumpWM REPL, for example.<p>* The syntax<p>Some people get hung up on the parenthesis, but I like them.  The syntax is consistent, it&#x27;s easy to indent, it&#x27;s easy to navigate in the editor, and there aren&#x27;t punctuation marks all over the place.<p>* High level with good cross-platform performance<p>I&#x27;m too lazy to post evidence right now, but IME unoptimized Common Lisp is 15-20x faster than Python using the same algorithm, and maybe 1&#x2F;2 - 1&#x2F;10 the speed of C or C++.<p>With simple optimizations (adding type&#x2F;function type declarations, etc.) the Lisp code can be 30-50x faster than Python, and near the speed of C++.  Usually the optimized Lisp is almost exactly the same as the slower code, but has a few type declarations and (declare (optimize (speed 3))) added in.<p>* Libraries and Community<p>The CL community is pretty small, and most libraries are created by people scratching their own itch.  They&#x27;re not always perfect, but they&#x27;ll usually get the job done.  If not, most maintainers are happy to get pull requests.  I personally like that, but it may not work for people who want &quot;off the shelf&quot;, supported libraries that work in every situation.<p>I&#x27;ve found the community generally helpful and easy to work with.  Getting libraries added to QuickLisp is quick and easy.<p>Interfacing with C code is really easy.  For small libraries or a function or two using CFFI is dead simple.  For larger projects cl-autowrap can wrap whole libraries easily - it uses llvm and clang to autogenerate the entire binding.<p>* Lots of books and references available<p>Lots of smart people (Guy Steele, Paul Graham, Peter Norvig, etc.) have used and written about Lisp, and there are some really unique and interesting books about it.  &quot;The Art of the Metaobject Protocol&quot; and &quot;Let Over Lambda&quot; are two examples that really ighlight what makes Lisp unique."

2019-08-14,"&gt; Lisp is a programmable programming language.
— John Foderaro, CACM, September 1991<p>Often times programming languages are designed with a particular use case in mind. (E.g. JS: web, Perl: scripting, Erlang: telephony, etc.) LISP was made to think about computation, and it acts well as a programming language work with programming.<p>One of the goals of Racket (a dialect of LISP) is to make it easy to create your own languages.<p>&gt; Racket is the second best programming language in the world—the first best one is the one you build in Racket."

2019-08-14,"I am not a programmer by profession, so I can chose my own poison. Scheme is just too much fun! I never liked python,ruby,c# etc. What scheme gave me was a smallish set of well-chosen primitives that compose well. Simple syntax together with macros so that I can abstract away any boilerplate that any eventual language designer forgot to foresee in a way superior to any other language. Lisp macros really are superior. I know enough haskell to know that &quot;we don&#x27;t need macros because we have typeclasses&#x2F;an expressive typesystem&#x2F;template haskell&quot; is only a half true.<p>Guile scheme is my scheme of choice.

2019-08-14,"Start looking outside your company for a job. You will likely need to settle for lower pay if you want to move to a management position. It&#x27;s obvious that your current bosses think that you can&#x27;t manage a team.<p>Also just because you&#x27;re excellent at your job it does not mean you will be an excellent manager. Great managers don&#x27;t need to be technical wizards but they need to know how to evaluate people and be able to make the best decisions from the information your team gives you. Managers are best at managing people and making sure you get the best from the team and you&#x27;re able to manage your bosses too. Which means that if they ask you to acomplish X then you will accoplish X plus more.<p>Techies believe that the best way to management is to show how great they know their area of expertise. No, that won&#x27;t get you into management. You need to show that you can get people to do what you want, inspire them, and as you get up the ladder you can manage a budget and all the other parts of a particular department.<p>You will also notice that managers can be jerks but when they speak to a team they come across as very charasmatic.

Some people make big toys.<p>Nobody is expected to understand anybody else&#x27;s code, so you can indulge any kind of whim, and it is easy to make any whim work well enough. Meanwhile, the mathematical bedrock of computation outcrops more frequently, so that programs can resemble theorems if you like that."
2019-08-14,"It&#x27;s elegant. It&#x27;s (relatively) easy to write a basic parser. LISP code is readily expressible in the same basic data structures provided in the language so you get meta programming almost for free and thus extending LISP is (relatively) easy too. Whereas C feels like an abstract machine language, LISP feels like an abstract &#x27;mathematical computation&#x27; language. It&#x27;s, like all languages, a different way of thinking about computation in the same way that human languages also seem to be (at least marginally) different ways of representing or expressing thought.<p>And once you&#x27;ve come to appreciate it, jokes like &quot;HAVE YOU READ YOUR SICP TODAY?&quot; will be funny to you.<p>In terms of &#x27;getting shit done&#x27;, it&#x27;s not so &#x27;good&#x27;, not that one can&#x27;t get shit done with LISP, but that it&#x27;s not necessary nor, given all likely real world constraints, particularly that much of, if at all, an advantage relative to other (families of) languages.<p>It&#x27;s also historically important so there&#x27;s a benefit in knowing about it and being familiar with it too. And knowing the history helps understand why people still love it, even as a lot of what was once unique or special about it can be found much more widely."

I wonder if people who know they have to sell in the next three years, but don&#x27;t want to sell today (e.g. a work move) are also a target market.  If I know my job is going to move me in 2 years, I might like to use your service to retain 80% of the upside, but insure against downside when I sell.<p>2. I once read a book about real-estate investing, which said that the real way you make money is to buy rental properties with poor cash flow, &#x27;fixup&#x27; the tenants to improve the cash flow, and then sell, repeatedly.  I wonder if your appreciation-potential-evaluation&#x2F;downside-insurance model applied to rental properties for sale, combined with coaching&#x2F;tools for aspiring landlords, might be attractive.<p>It seems like right now, you are primarily using the purchaser as a source of capital, and other comments are saying &quot;why don&#x27;t you just raise the money yourself?&quot;, but if you were also using the purchaser as more like a franchisee, someone who is actively working to improve the cashflow of the property by upgrading the tenants with your (automated) advice, that might create a more interesting relationship where you have more room to add value (its more complex to analyze multi-tenant rentals, its more complex to choose high-potential landlord partners, etc).<p>Random thoughts.  It&#x27;s a very interesting idea, very original."

Eventually most of us come back down to Earth but it is a fun ride.<p>There is also a mystique around the powers of Lisp.  I do believe it is a massively expressive and powerful language in the hands of a master.  But part of it is historical.

I just exited a Ph.D. program in algebraic geometry, looking at performing differential geometry over discrete &quot;manifolds&quot;. In particular, I was interested in porting General Relativity to a discrete differential geometry realm. Now, I&#x27;m looking for remote work.<p>In broad strokes, my talents lie in three main domains. Relaying what I hear from my peers: 1) my ramp-up time on technical subjects is fast, 2) my analysis is deep and careful, and 3) my explanations of highly technical material are lucid and helpful. Words are words though, so I hope to find a team with lots of opportunities for growth, and where my natural talents are useful and appreciated.<p>On the DevOps side, I have a relatively comprehensive understanding of Linux as an OS, having used Linux primarily since middle school. These days, I pretty much live in the command line and (finally) have the background to rely primarily on man&#x2F;info pages and source code for my documentation needs, without resorting to blogs or wiki pages.<p>Finally, I love math. I find it beautiful, exhilarating, not to mention useful. Regardless of day job, I find myself spending a good bit of my free time studying algebra, geometry, and their intersection. This interest spills over into languages like Haskell and Scheme, hardware execution models, and even the Linux kernel.<p>I would flourish in R&amp;D or any position that can use an overabudance of curiosity and a scrutinizing eye.<p>Looking forward to hearing from you!"
2019-08-14,Pretty cool concept!  You&#x27;re basically letting people buy into your real estate hedge fund. :)<p>Something I didn&#x27;t see addressed in the FAQ:  Do I get to include closing costs and agent fees in my cost basis before determining your 20% cut?<p>If not I can see a case where appreciation was minimal and I actually lose money one you get your cut because those fees eat up all the appreciation.

2019-08-14,"Many comments mention the merits of Lisp. That&#x27;s all well and good, but I think they miss the largely historical reasons that Lisp is so popular here:<p>Paul Graham wrote <i>Ansi Common Lisp</i> and <i>On Lisp</i>. Both are great books and were used in university courses in the 90s and 00s.<p>Paul Graham cofounded a startup called Viaweb, implemented in Lisp, that sold to Yahoo.<p>Paul Graham wrote a bunch of essays about tech startups at paulgraham.com. These essays frequently extolled the virtues of Lisp and other high level languages, citing it as a major factor in Viaweb&#x27;s success.<p>Paul Graham, in his essays, strongly encouraged skilled, motivated programmers to build startups instead of working at large companies.<p>Paul Graham created Y Combinator, betting his time and money on the growth of startups that he predicted and promoted, popularizing startup incubators in the process.<p>Paul Graham created Startup News when Reddit started going mainstream, predating the existence of subreddits. Startup News provided a real-world application to inform the design and development of Arc, a Lisp language.<p>Paul Graham renamed Startup News to Hacker News. And here we are.<p>===<p>As someone who has been here for 12½ years, I view the Lisp sentiment as echoes of HN&#x27;s past, inextricably linked to the Lisp enthusiasm of HN&#x27;s founder: Paul Graham.<p>While I agree with many comments here that Lisp is a language worth learning, I think they miss the mark as to why Lisp continues to come up on Hacker News. The majority of the original Startup News members were Lisp enthusiasts."

In a previous life, I ran for political office and raising money would have been so much easier if I had kept those contacts warm over time. Big problem here is that it requires Google Contacts. Do people actually use that? Phone&#x2F;FB contacts would be much more useful in my book.<p>I actually was just thinking about this type of product just yesterday while walking around a part of the city I&#x27;ve never been to -- how cool would it be to proactively shoot folks a text whenever I&#x27;m in their part of town (determined by GPS)? I end up doing this manually and I always forget folks until it&#x27;s too late."
2019-08-14,"One thing not mentioned in the current set of responses is the REPL style and interactive coding style that you can have with a LISP that is different than what a traditional compiled language gives you in the edit-compile-run-edit loop or a dynamic language gives you in the edit-run-edit loop. When you are using a REPL you can poke and push at any part of the system like a debugger but the system is still alive. Without that interactive nature sometimes you end up doing print&#x2F;debugger work to understand some quirk of a datastructure but in a LISP&#x2F;REPL it&#x27;s plainly visible and you don&#x27;t have to think about it.<p>If it&#x27;s integrated with an editor you can load functions or different versions of the function and see how each work with live data, you can slurp new data in, and all sorts of flexible dynamic things that let you find the program you want (which always helps when using third-party or unfamiliar code). This is more a feature of all kinds of REPL languages and not wholly specific to LISPs.<p>One of the basis of a LISP&#x2F;Scheme language is that it is constructed of very few basic primitives that are assembled into a greater system and that greater system is part of your program instead of being things you don&#x27;t touch (like libc), and you are (generally) welcome to touch them, alias them, or manipulate them to help your goal and program. This allows things like being able to temporarily hook a function call to add some debug information and then unhook a function call via a REPL and carry on. I find that pointing to people to r5rs <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;schemers.org&#x2F;Documents&#x2F;Standards&#x2F;R5RS&#x2F;HTML&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;schemers.org&#x2F;Documents&#x2F;Standards&#x2F;R5RS&#x2F;HTML&#x2F;</a> and focusing on sections 4, 5, and 6 help show off how little is required to describe the basics of the language."

2019-08-14,"I&#x27;m confused; it goes beyond the big, GP social networks by focusing on more meaningful relationships (how?) but I create them by pulling directly from these sources of relationships?<p>What exactly is a &quot;personal&quot; CRM that doesn&#x27;t focus on selling? A curated address book?<p>&gt;&gt; Most people realize the value and fulfillment that come from maintaining relationships, but occasionally still fall out of touch due to forgetfulness<p>I think these is the fundamental premise that I don&#x27;t personally agree with; the value of the relationship is what keeps you engaged. It&#x27;s not simple forgetfulness that causes you to lose touch - you are prioritizing other activities over the relationship.<p>This doesn&#x27;t seem right or make me feel good though; it makes me seem like a self-centered jerk, so can&#x27;t be true - I must be lacking (yet more) networking applications that &quot;promote keeping in touch&quot;.<p>I think there is opportunity for very specific purpose networking tools, like linkedin before they decided to be a general-purpose social network or centered around communities and activities. I don&#x27;t think &quot;relationships&quot; is specific enough, unless you&#x27;re focusing on physical relationships like dating or hookups.<p>Also, the amount of private information you&#x27;re asking to expose right out the gate is a non-starter for me. If it&#x27;s curated (and thus meaningful) make your on-boarding &amp; setup reflect this. I realize it&#x27;s largely due to eas-of-use, but to me the process is a giant data vacuum."

If your algorithms are any good you&#x27;ll make a lot of money, and you&#x27;ll help your customers make money.<p>My problem with Lofty is that it is bad for society.<p>Fundamentally, this is gentrification-as-a-service. You&#x27;re driving additional demand to neighborhoods at inflection points, and if it works well it&#x27;s definitely going to accelerate displacement. It is true that Blackrock et al already do this and likely have similar in-house algorithms, but this will widen the market and make things worse. I&#x27;m not completely against gentrification, especially when there&#x27;s development that increases market supply- and when done right that can actually decrease displacement. (an example you&#x27;re probably familiar with is the USC Village. Despite the criticism it gets, it removed thousands of student renters from the South Central LA market which likely resulted in downward pressure on prices) But housing speculation like this drives up prices and only hurts poor and minority communities.<p>To Jerry and Max: did you consider the ethical implications when deciding to start this? I completely see the angle that you&#x27;re democratizing access to an investment asset that currently mainly benefits wealthy institutional investors.

In the U.S. I would think it could be a very narrow edge they put themselves on, one which could be very costly but not necessarily because of a lost job for a candidate.  IANAL but I don&#x27;t think any employment laws would prevent it directly (but some may indirectly).  The fact that they are accessing a stolen asset however, means they could be sued over the use of the data pretty easily.  Either way, any company with any ethics would avoid it as accessing the data itself is a quagmire."

Thankfully, generally speaking, it’s unlikely they’ll waste time attempting legal remedies, and it’s also unlikely that HR is going to go into details about your actions if questioned by a potential future employer, but the distinction between “So-and-so worked here from $start to $end”, “So-and-so worked here from $start to $end and was terminated with cause”, and “So-and-so worked here from $start to $end and was terminated for fraud” are material to your future job prospects."
2019-08-14,"My first CRM implementation in a large enterprise was back in 2004, so 15 years ago, OMG. Since then, I have seen and heard of many implementations that failed miserably because one critical factor: data entry was too hard&#x2F;complicated. Just look at any CRM solution out there, pick up any entity, let&#x27;s say, an Account. Click &#x27;add new&#x27; and you will see 3 thousand different fields populating your screen, for those you won&#x27;t have 30% of the data to fill in. Some process will  mandate that you fill in at least 60% of that data somehow, so you cancel that creation and move ahead using a workaround.<p>In my opinion, CRM data entry should always be incremental&#x2F;progressive, very granular, allowing processes to flow without frustrating users.

(i.e. What perks are you offering that make it worth doing the deal through you? Negotiations? Acting as a buyer&#x27;s agent?)<p>As a data point, I used to have a ruby script that would take a bunch of MLS IDs and go pull a ton of facts from Zillow and a few other sources. I would have my realtor set up a high-level search (i.e. SFH in these areas under $500k) and then take their daily emails and run them through my script to identify potentially &quot;undervalued&quot; properties. I still had to hand-check them after, but it was a pretty useful second filter (the MLS search being the first)."

So I can use your insurance to protect myself in the event the value of my house decreases in the future.<p>Your company is directly responsible for the first 20% decline. After that, other companies are responsible for the rest. And even if you go out of business, I&#x27;m still covered by those other companies.<p>Firstly, is that correct?<p>Secondly, if so -- what happens if you go out of business and my house goes down exactly 20%? I assume that means I have no coverage.<p>Thirdly, who&#x27;s insuring the houses after a 20% decline? And why should I have any reason to believe they&#x27;d still be in business if the market collapses 20%+? The last time that happened, almost every insurance company and investment bank went out of business.<p>Finally, how much does this cost as a percentage of the house&#x27;s current value yearly? Roughly...<p>It&#x27;s an interesting idea.

This is probably the critical thing I do because it sets a track of what kind of material I should be focusing on for the subseqent learning tools.<p>- Anki&#x2F;spaced-repetition to remember things like acronyms<p>- Quick YouTube talks (specifically those not in a webinar format; usually bad production quality and a lot of padding not related to the topic)<p>- Games to put theory into practice (CTFs, bug bounties, video games that are very abstracted from real hacking but still require exercising logic)<p>- Podcasts that look at the industry from different perspectives. Currently listen to CyberWork, which has a lot of fluff but I offset that with Darknet Diaries which does a great job of storytelling.<p>- Trying to explain these concepts in layman&#x27;s terms to others"

2019-08-13,"Your goal is to train them, guide them, coach, mentor and turn them into good developers that you would want to hire.   It&#x27;s a full time job.<p>My approach is I start by giving them simple tasks to get comfortable.  I have them pairing with more experienced folks to get hang of the teams approach.   I engage them in discussions, making sure they have solid foundation for what they&#x27;re working on.  In my case for Enterprise app, that&#x27;s making sure they really understand OOP, Making sure they understand interface and composition over inheritance, making sure they understand SOLID principles.<p>When it comes to code, I talk a lot about design.   We can take a problem and solve it 5 different ways, and weigh the pros and cons.  Sometimes there&#x27;s no best way, and what&#x27;s more important is understanding your approach and why.   You might want to optimize for shorter development time, or for faster code execution, or for extensibility or for reliability and they all require different things.  What is the current constraint of our situation calling for?   Sometimes we can take the same code and rewrite it over and over in different ways till we are sick of it.<p>My goal with interns is to make sure they understand the fundamentals, and then to realize that there&#x27;s truly a hundred ways to skin the cat, and not to run with the first solution they think of.   I don&#x27;t really like the review over software, other team members can do that, but I prefer to pair and we just talk casually and share screen while we talk about the code.   If what they did needs a completely revamp, I might give them a pseudocode and send them off after discussion.<p>I make sure they understand that code is a small part of it.  Did they capture the WHY of the code?  Did they test?  What type of test?  unit? e2e? stress?   Did they document on how to test&#x2F;run their code?  Did they write documentation?<p>Your code review must match up to your documented code guidelines, I show why our approach is in alignment with our guideline.  You can&#x27;t review without a guideline.   The end goal is to have someone that will eventually become a very productive team member.<p>In the beginning, spending 2-4hrs is not far fetched for me.  It all comes down to their strength and prior background.  Good luck to your interns."

2019-08-13,"LOI&#x27;s for enterprise clients are totally fine and tying it to a trial is common in my experience, although in my experience that is for trials that last months and may take weeks to months to configure and setup. We have used LOI&#x27;s quite a bit to help us find the right business model and to gather support before we were actively making final sales.  It also can help you show intent and early demand to investors.<p>Overall enterprise clients generally are quite receptive to these, at least for more complex products, as they are not contracts, simply non-binding letters which generally also do not require much if any legal review.  If you put detailed terms into the LOI that is when things can get stickier and then legal review becomes necessary at most enterprises.<p>What are you trying to use the LOI for, if you had 10 in the next 2 months what would change?  In my view a product that can be tried by an enterprise in 7 days means there is not a ton of complexity to the product and likely a low barrier to entry so an LOI may be useless or worse delay trails and conversions.  If after 7 days you know if they are buying or not then why do an LOI?  Reality is it may take 1-2 weeks to get an LOI done at a fast moving enterprise and a month wouldn&#x27;t be atypical at many.<p>If the product takes 2-4 weeks of setup or you need to install equipment etc at their site than an LOI would be smart to show intent.  But you&#x27;d still have to define why you want an LOI and what comes after.  Is it just because you want to gauge their interest before spending weeks configuring the product, then ok.  Is it to show investors demand?  If so then it may not help you a ton, as the investors will wait to see LOI to conversion rates since the trial period is so short."

Yes you don&#x27;t have a predictable income, but your constant worrying about it will hamper your ability to have one. It is a vicious loop. Be calm, keep improving your skills and producing better results.
In your anxiety to provide for your kid, it is easy to forget to actually &quot;be&quot; with them, love them. Children can easily pick these things in you.
Read&#x2F;tell them stories every night. Goof off with them - this is your chance to be a kid again !! It is surprising how easily you can get away with &quot;my kids insist I do&#x2F;play this with them&quot; :)!. The world can wait, it will be there still, when you return to it.<p>Like others have said, lower your costs - increase your savings. Keep increasing your Savings Rate. Drop things that cost but add little&#x2F;no value. Convenience has a cost - Embrace inconvenience. Prefer buying used things, learn to invest at a low cost. Stay healthy. Parks and libraries are free, use them over other forms of entertainments."

If you&#x27;re not faced with some case where you&#x27;re flashing a laptop on a regular basis, don&#x27;t aim for 100% coverage on your settings.<p>1. Figure out what files really aren&#x27;t easy to replace (eg. vscode config, bashrc, etc.<p>2. Make a dead simple script that copies all these files&#x2F;directories (and the script itself) to a temp folder and makes an archive of that folder.<p>3. Email it to yourself.<p>4. Make a `&#x2F;remind me to ....` on Slack or an email service to remind you every few months to do this.<p>When I do recover, I don&#x27;t just copy and paste all the files in. I use them as references as I rebuild. Because after a few years, my configs are filled with obsolete cruft or there&#x27;s better ways to do things and I&#x27;ll notice it when I go to paste in that segment into the bashrc or whatnot.<p>This certainly isn&#x27;t an approach for everyone.

They even managed to virtualize the secure-element and access the console from there.<p>A task like that is something that is very rare in startups these days and to get it fully working like this is a herculean task, because the interals are closed-source and undocumented and was certainly reverse-engineered.

2019-08-12,"So I&#x27;ve got a MacBook 2016 that&#x27;s slightly affected. It&#x27;s my impression that the keyboard is simply the weak spot of the current MacBooks. Meaning, if something goes wrong, chances are it&#x27;s the keyboard.<p>In my case, the fix is fairly easy. Put canned air in the office and at home. Apple has a support document about it. I need to do that every month or two.<p>It wouldn&#x27;t stop me from getting a MacBook, I need it for my work. But I&#x27;ve got two tips; budget for a nice Thunderbolt dock at work and at home, so you can use external input devices. Don&#x27;t eat at the keyboard.<p>If you can hold out, perhaps you can wait for the 16&quot; model that&#x27;s supposedly coming, it&#x27;s rumored to have a different keyboard. But these are just rumors and you could wait for a looooong time."
2019-08-12,"Definitely - I&#x27;ve been doing this for about five years with all my machines. A rough overview of the setup:<p>- A public repository with a Nix configuration file: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gitlab.com&#x2F;victor-engmark&#x2F;root"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gitlab.com&#x2F;victor-engmark&#x2F;root</a>. This does the global setup, installing applications, configuring global services, enabling hardware, etc, and gets me 90% of the way to identical machines with a single `nixos-rebuild switch`.<p>- A public repository with dotfiles and main application configuration: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gitlab.com&#x2F;victor-engmark&#x2F;tilde"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gitlab.com&#x2F;victor-engmark&#x2F;tilde</a>. Allows me to configure user applications once for all my machines.<p>- A private repository with secrets such as SSH keys and host-specific configuration like video drivers, screen layout etc.<p>This makes it possible to get from a fresh OS install to a developer workstation with everything from keyboard layout to my favourite window manager configured as I like it within minutes.<p>I consider learning configuration management a nice bonus of this setup, but of course that is not for everyone.<p>The biggest problem with this is how many programs seem to go out of their way to make their configuration hard to version control. Firefox moved to SQLite for everything years ago, but at least there&#x27;s the Sync service. Some applications reorder configuration items every time they save (I&#x27;ve built scripts to order them properly). And others include things which IMO don&#x27;t belong in &quot;user&quot; configuration files such as window size, recently opened files and which configuration tab was last open.<p>PS: I recently moved to Nix on NixOS from Puppet (similar features to Ansible and Chef) on Arch Linux for the system configuration. Nix has several massive advantages over at least Puppet and Ansible, both of which I&#x27;ve used a fair bit:<p>- <i>Much</i> shorter configuration. For example, `services.fail2ban.enable = true;` is enough to install, enable and start a fail2ban service when building the configuration, and `time.timeZone = &quot;Pacific&#x2F;Auckland&quot;;` means I don&#x27;t have to even think about where that piece of configuration is stored, or in which of the infinite formats used for Linux configuration.<p>- Trivial rollback to earlier configurations, during runtime or at the boot menu. This saved my backside when I screwed up a GRUB-related setting - just reboot and select the previous configuration.<p>- You can install applications as a non-root user to try them out.<p>- I&#x27;ve been using Nix for less than a month, but it&#x27;s far easier to just get stuff done with it than with Puppet or Ansible, and the end results so far are just generally nicer.<p>So if you want a simple system configuration you can copy around to configure everything the same way I would thoroughly recommend NixOS."
2019-08-12,"Edit: We just came back from a long walk out. At first I was quiet and awkward. Then I talked about it and handled it better. I even told her how I asked the HN community for help and how it helped me. It turns out she did the same in some mom&#x27;s community.
The advice she we got was completely different. Hers were things like &#x27;take a cute pic&#x27;.
Mine were more practical and what I wanted to hear. Even though some of them were scary. 
Maybe, I should have provided better context. Everyone assumed am from US or EU. Anyways, thanks for the help and sold advice. I was in the toilet shaking when I posted this. You guys helped me to think about it in a practical way. I still don&#x27;t have a solid plan but I feel like I have a clear head."
2019-08-12,"I&#x27;ve recently employed a docker-based strategy for this. I work for multiple clients, some of whom go months between giving me work.<p>Each client has their own docker-compose setup on my machine - and I have a secondary machine that I rsync the dockerfiles and some supporting scripts[1] over to for out-and-about. I have a couple of scripts for generating the docker templates for new projects.<p>This means I only need to manually set up three things on a new machine: Docker, a password manager, and a text editor (I&#x27;m using Atom, but Vimmers &#x2F; Emaxions could probably roll this into the template generator)<p>Depending on how locked-down your setup is, you might find that as time goes on and distros go out of support, you need to update your dockerfiles - but I think you&#x27;d need to make those kinds of tweaks with any system.<p>Note that I no longer advocate a dockerfile per-project, but per-client (or some other sub-structure) - that way, production dockerfiles don&#x27;t interfere with developer dockerfiles. Some day, I&#x27;d like to experiment with &quot;sidecar&quot; containers instead... some serious advantages there.<p>[1] Supporting scripts include the templates, a few bash aliases, an easy way to find the ip of a docker machine, an easy way to open a bash shell within a docker container, etc."
2019-08-12,I was really impressed when I got a new MacBook this year. With my previous Windows machines it was always one or two days of reinstalling everything and then a few more weeks until I had all my settings back. With the Mac I restored from Time Machine and after a few hours I had my machine back pretty much the way it was before with just a few settings missing. That alone is worth a certain premium to me.

2019-08-12,"What are your concerns regarding how much time is spent?<p>On my team all code is reviewed by at least two peers and I find it difficult to not review changes. Sometimes people screw up requirements (or they were unclear and the developer is unfamiliar with the existing implementation), sometimes their variable names suck, or the level of abstraction is inappropriate, or the tests say they&#x27;re testing one thing but really do another.<p>On larger code changes this can be up to an hour or two a day (depending on how many are opeened) but I see it as an investment in the health of our codebase and avoiding technical debt."
2019-08-12,"I recently started doing this. I&#x27;m using GNU Stow plus Git to maintain my dotfiles and scripts (one thing I do in scripts is check uname to decide if its macOS or Linux). You could use Gitlab, GitHub, or host your own Git (e.g. reachable via WireGuard). Furthermore, I use Topgrade [1] to maintain most machines. It abstracts Homebrew, APT, Vim Plug, Pip, Cargo, and a plethora of other software management tools. I keep a spreadsheet to write down changes I make on a system, and then allow myself to cross which machines also have this change.<p>This all works well for me, and my Macs have TimeMachine, which is synced over WLAN at home network. However my Linux machines don&#x27;t have such luxury (referring to the UI here).

2019-08-12,"My system for multiple Debian and OpenBSD machines:<p>Configuration files, secrets files, and personal scripts are stored in a git repository. There is a shell script that sets up symbolic links for the configuration files, &#x2F;etc&#x2F;hosts file, and crontabs (the machines all back up to each other and to several servers using rsync and hardlink snapshots automatically, in addition to offline media backups). Machine-specific configurations (mostly keyboard and screen) are conditional on hostname and pulled in by symbolic links or templating.<p>The scripts have some OpenBSD-specific conditionals. Also .profile is conditional on the operating system.<p>GNU Emacs configuration lives in a separate git repository. EXWM is my window manager on Linux and OpenBSD, which makes things easier. I run different versions of Emacs on different machines (some from the package manager, some built from source). The configuration is conditional on terminal or graphics mode, as well as on X11 specifically. There is also conditional configuration for Mac OS X for when I have to work on someone else&#x27;s machines.<p>I do not automate operating system or package installation (I also get new hardware &quot;every couple of years,&quot; and all the machines have different software installed), but the installed package list (`apt-mark showmanual` on Debian and `pkg_info -m` on OpenBSD) is part of the backups, so I can restore or bring up a new machine from the list quickly.<p>Reference and media files are synced with Unison, my personal notes and projects are in git repositories, and mail is synced with offlineimap.<p>I find the above makes it easy to bring up new machines and, more important, effortless to keep the relevant configurations on multiple machines consistent, while not getting in the way of differences (different software on different machines, software compiled from source vs installed via the package manager).<p>I plan to start using GuixSD in the near future, and look forward to using it to automate server and virtual machine configuration and provisioning."

If you pull up any population density map you can see it, yes California is a big state but the density of the population overwhelmingly is on the East side of the Country.<p>2. The cost of land and overall infrastructure as well as employment costs are far less in the South East than in the West or North East.  Not to mention there are more favorable terms and less bureaucracy to build generally than say in California or New York.<p>Even if you look at the centers outside the South East you&#x27;ll see they picked lower cost states, and what are likely states which will give better terms on taxes and land but still have the overall infrastructure to support them.<p>Just my 2 cents, but to me it seems like they are close to their customers based on population density.<p>*edit, added a sentence."

Sometime after, I then moved onto financial services, then to construction as I got my teaching credential, then teaching, and, finally, after all that, eventually found my way to a 2yo start up doing software development (toss in a couple more kids along the way). It took me about 7 years to find software, and now I&#x27;ve been doing that ever since. It was the first time we had some wiggle room in our finances.

2019-08-12,"We had a term where I used to work - Promotion Oriented Architecture. In most places progress in the engineering org chart is heavily influenced by delivering software for complex usecases. Unfortunately IME most developers correlate complexity in the problem domain to complexity in the solution domain. This becomes a very strong driver for adopting novel solutions, even when a simpler one would have sufficed.<p>A second factor is the difficulty in measuring success. Once a solution is adopted it is very hard to demonstrate the opportunity cost incurred by not selecting a simpler solution. And the costs themselves may not be evident until long after delivery. And since measurement is hard, the lack of data also makes it difficult to articulate effective counter arguments to gratuitous complexity"

2019-08-12,"Hey man, first off... no judgement intended, but look on Glass Door and make sure you&#x27;re being paid appropriately for your line of work in your region. And... consider moving to a region that pays more. Just saying, $50k seems low for tech &#x2F; anything that would bring you to the Hacker News community.<p>If you&#x27;re freelancing, and sometimes you get paid and sometimes you don&#x27;t, you need to work on getting clients to pay up-front (most are happy to do the first payment up-front at least), or at minimum make sure your contracts are solid and you&#x27;re billing and following up for the work you did. (This is the bane of freelancing, and it gets more complex the more clients you have.) Fixing your contracts and invoicing will keep things consistent. Cut any client that doesn&#x27;t pay on time, and never lift a finger to help someone who is behind on payments -- so many times people try and be &quot;nice&quot; but if they don&#x27;t pay, they&#x27;re just using you.<p>Generally speaking, so many issues are sorted out for you if you take a job at a bigger company. Stability, insurance, consistent pay... this is a huge draw for a lot of people. Freelancing is fun for diversity, and the pay can be better, but in the long-run most of my friends who work at big companies seem like they have more time for their families. Something to consider.<p>Savings is going to be key, and it&#x27;s impossible to retroactively save, like it&#x27;s impossible to retroactively diet, so you just fix the issues as you see them and try to avoid mistakes and stay healthy going forward. You need to find a way to get money saved up. It&#x27;ll help with your stress. When I freelance, I try and keep 6 months of cash for all bills on hand. My mortgage, car payments, etc. -- should work dry up, I want runway to fix it.<p>The prerequisite to the above is having a budget. A lot of people just sort of spend what they spend, and don&#x27;t think about it. This is lazy and wasteful. If you eat out a lot, set a budget... and consider scaling that down. When I first started tracking, I realized I was spending about $600 a month eating out. I cut that to $300 -- it was a bit harder at first, but I like cooking and meal prep, and within a year I went from eating out almost every meal to almost never eating out at all -- unless it&#x27;s for work.<p>Once I had a budget, and my target savings goals, I got there by auditing my spend, and cutting expenses. Then putting aside 10% of my paycheck (for a few years), into paying off all debts and building savings. Once I hit the &quot;cushion&quot; goal, I still take 10% and put it into a 1) rainy day fund, and 2) retirement fund. The rainy day fund is for bigger purchases... things like, &quot;Oh crap, I need a new AC,&quot; type stuff.

2019-08-12,"On a non-monetary note, here&#x27;s some advice I gave my brother recently.  (My daughter is now 15 months old, and I was thinking about what advice I wish I&#x27;d been given before she was born):<p>1) Remember at all times that no matter how tired you are, your partner is almost certainly much more tired. Basically, give her a free pass for the first few months, if not longer. (The hormonal changes a few days in are no fun either)<p>2) There is no point comforting a crying baby - they just don&#x27;t understand what you&#x27;re trying to do. Distract the fuck out of them instead. (This from a baby psychologist on a BBC documentary.)<p>3) Babies are their own tutorial. They start off really simple, with about three things to remember, and then once you&#x27;ve got the hang of those things they start adding new ones on. But you don&#x27;t need to panic about whether you can do it, it&#x27;s not complicated, just full on.<p>4) Bonding - do not panic if it takes you six months (or longer) to fall in love with your child. I certainly felt incredibly protective of Sophia from the moment she was born, but I didn&#x27;t feel fully connected to her until she was able to smile at me, and we could have some kind of interaction. It&#x27;s really easy to feel awful because all the TV and movies says it happens instantly, but it can take a fair while, so don&#x27;t worry about it.<p>5) Ignore any advice you don&#x27;t like.<p><a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;andrewducker.dreamwidth.org&#x2F;3746257.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;andrewducker.dreamwidth.org&#x2F;3746257.html</a>"

2019-08-12,"Congratulations!  One thing, not as major as some of what other commenters have mentioned but worth knowing, is that you should not feel guilty about buying used clothes&#x2F;cribs&#x2F;etc. for your kid.
1) most baby clothes get worn very few times before they&#x27;re outgrown, so you can get them in good shape at garage sales or thrift shops
2) your baby doesn&#x27;t care whether it is dressed stylishly or not, it just cares if it&#x27;s comfortable and its parents are nearby
3) your kid will likely throw up on it five minutes of putting it on anyway :)<p>Some parents feel guilt about buying used things for their child, and end up spending a lot of $$ on new clothes, crib, etc. for a child that will not benefit from all that extra expense in the least.  You don&#x27;t want to cut corners on, for example, health care or quality food, but things like clothes because they are visible can cause some parents of newborns to spend a lot of money they don&#x27;t need to.  Save it for the things that actually matter."

2019-08-12,"Depth. You should absolutely shrink your market size at first. You should go for demand shaped like a well, not a lake. You can always spread out later. But if your initial cohort of users absolutely loves your product, you will be in a great situation.<p>from pg:<p>When a startup launches, there have to be at least some users who really need what they&#x27;re making — not just people who could see themselves using it one day, but who want it urgently. Usually this initial group of users is small, for the simple reason that if there were something that large numbers of people urgently needed and that could be built with the amount of effort a startup usually puts into a version one, it would probably already exist. Which means you have to compromise on one dimension: you can either build something a large number of people want a small amount, or something a small number of people want a large amount. Choose the latter. Not all ideas of that type are good startup ideas, but nearly all good startup ideas are of that type.<p>Imagine a graph whose x axis represents all the people who might want what you&#x27;re making and whose y axis represents how much they want it. If you invert the scale on the y axis, you can envision companies as holes. Google is an immense crater: hundreds of millions of people use it, and they need it a lot. A startup just starting out can&#x27;t expect to excavate that much volume. So you have two choices about the shape of hole you start with. You can either dig a hole that&#x27;s broad but shallow, or one that&#x27;s narrow and deep, like a well.<p><a href=""http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.paulgraham.com&#x2F;startupideas.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.paulgraham.com&#x2F;startupideas.html</a>"

If you understand overfitting, L2 or batch processing in Keras, you will be able to use in any other framework (after looking up its API).<p>When it comes to the mathematical background, Deep Learning Book by Ian Goodfellow et al. is a great starting point, giving a lot of overview. Though, it requires a lot of interest in maths.

The closest example is CS231n: Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition (which is, IMHO, a masterpiece).

Having children is world changing, because you no longer have to think only about yourself — there is someone else who loves you, and depends completely upon you. There is no one that I&#x27;ve ever spoken with has ever said that they felt ready for this change. That&#x27;s completely normal, and that&#x27;s okay.<p>My wife and I were relatively young — age 21 — when we had our first son. Our situation was somewhat similar to yours in that we had a financial challenge; we learned how to utilize what was available to us. As others have said in this thread: your community and relationships are extremely valuable. It takes a village!"

2019-08-12,"I tried to do this, I wanted to track my cats. My problem was that I was trying to fix this by using one tech. I did a fair bit of research on Bluetooth, cheap 433mhz radio, accelerometers etc. All had drawbacks, from size, cost, availability, missing features (eg the signal strenght) and I gave up when I moved to London.<p>If I try this again, and by that I mean when I try this again, I will go a different route. The core will be a pair of accelerometers, with a nfc tag, sending to a central unit the acceleration data and wifi signal strenght. A network of nfc readers will send info about what tags are they seeing. Maybe even some cameras.<p>The acceleration data will provide fine movement data and the rest is supposed to allow for data calibration and coarse tracking. Not an easy project, but should be fun."

I wanna tell you things I wish someone had told me, some of which will involve your career.<p>Assuming you and your partner live together-- you will have a strong hint if you&#x27;re having a boy or a girl by how the pregnancy affects the woman. Girls generally are a sleepy pregnancy. Boys are generally energetic pregnancies. This has to do with the fetus producing sex hormones which affect the mother.<p>Being a parent is a marathon, not a race. I burned myself out before the baby was even born trying to be everything to everyone. Trying to keep my wife happy, trying to keep an employer that could never be happy satisfied. Let me repeat this point. You need to separate yourself from things that can&#x27;t be satisfied. From employers whom you can never work enough for, from people who use all of your time and energy.<p>From now on, your life will be about stability. Children thrive on stability, and you will too. When you enter the stability mindset suddenly whole swaths of society make sense.<p>You&#x27;re going to have a hard time getting a job with a child. You won&#x27;t have time to study interview ephemera. Your hair will turn gray from lack of sleep. You won&#x27;t have time to participate in the latest fads, or to get drinks after work, and you will be judged for that.<p>But all the meanwhile, you&#x27;ll be doing something vastly more important."

2019-08-11,Initially I avoided macros and simply learnt to write &quot;flow-oriented&quot; small programs in Scheme.  It took a while to get used to not using many intermediate variables and simply feeding the output of one function into the next.  Once I started seeing patterns I found myself writing small general purpose functions from which I could assemble larger more complex functions.<p>BTW it is important realise that Common Lisp and Scheme have significant differences. Personally I prefer gnuScheme. I hear that many business applications prefer to use SBCL.
2019-08-11,I know several diabetics with pumps. If that is the type of thing you mean then it seems reasonable. If you mean getting an Amazon health snooping chip to monitor my health &quot;just in case&quot; then the answer would be &quot;no bloody way&quot;

2019-08-11,"For Windows, I use a PowerShell that launches a install of Choco followed by a bunch of Choco installs. For Mac, I have a bash script that installs homebrew then runs a bunch of brew and cask commands, installs xcode utils, and then command lines some App Store installs that aren’t available from cask."
2019-08-11,"I&#x27;ve been using puppet for everything for 8 years now. I try to avoid using the pre-built modules so that I know what everything is doing but I do use a few. There&#x27;s a base config I use everywhere and then some modules that are specific to my workstation and some that are specific to servers. Makes it really easy to bring up a new personal laptop&#x2F;desktop&#x2F;server and have a great base setup (passwordless ssh, a tinc overlay VPN, automatic upgrades, root emails that show up in my inbox, etc) as well as making it very easy to bring up new services (e.g., a new website is just a few tweaks and a deploy) or migrate between machines.<p>Couldn&#x27;t recommend it more. I started with puppet which seemed most robust at the time but I&#x27;m sure one of the others would do the same. Having all your configs in a single git repository and easy to deploy from a central point is great. And once you have that doing things like centrally managing keys (great for ssh and tinc) becomes really easy."

Ageism is more about potential - someone who is 40 but not a millionaire raises some flags.<p>But for a freelancer, it makes sense - this person has become too expensive to hire full time and&#x2F;or chose to forego a higher salary in favor of free time and family.

2019-08-11,"For me it was &quot;easy&quot; on Linux. But you need to commit to it, no pun intended.<p>I moved from Ubuntu to OpenSUSE Tumbleweed with almost no downtime. Only two things I had to change IIRC was to create the same group as Ubuntu with GID 1000 (100 on TW) and to find out the different package names because ubuntu is a mess.<p>The process that lead me to my current setup<p>- Install OS fresh (always using the same username because there are many cases where you can&#x27;t eval or access env&#x27;s)<p>- Ignore most of the $XDG folders except Desktop and 
Downloads.<p>- Have a centralized root folder and a scripts folder inside of it. All my scripts start with a check to see if the root is correct by checking an ENV<p>- Start a repo bare = false, worktree = &#x2F;home&#x2F;user, and use git add + excludesFile. I&#x27;ve tried everything there is and this is the best option by far because it&#x27;s way faster, you have to be explicit about what&#x27;s in your vcs. On VCS GUI .desktop I have added MimeType=inode&#x2F;directory; so it&#x27;s aware of the root.<p>- All my dotfiles are there but I use KDE and I added all the config files I care about so I can see what changes on updates, it helped me debug problems on update more than once.<p>- Don&#x27;t customize the OS manually in any way (unless the GUI writes to a config file), create a script and only make changes through it. That includes what you install, what you remove, config changes, daemons, EVERYTHING.<p>- I prefer programs that are configurable by config&#x2F;plain text files.<p>It&#x27;s &quot;reproducible&quot;, you have a script that describes your OS.<p>Personally use flatpak for everything that isn&#x27;t on TW&#x27;s repos and docker&#x2F;podman for local development.<p>Now some examples of things in my script that also show some statistics after I run it. There&#x27;s also a &quot;first run&quot; set of functions that I only run when it&#x27;s a clean install.<p>sudo zypper install &quot;${LIST_OF_PROGRAMS_TO_INSTALL[@]}&quot;

2019-08-11,I have a pulse; I&#x27;m not going to believe unsubstantiated speculation without seeing anything that resembles evidence.
2019-08-11,I found the problem was I only ever migrate to a new machine every five years +&#x2F;-.  Many assumptions are outdated by the next run.  Therefore keeping main dot files in vcs and a script to install my favorite packages is enough.

2019-08-11,"You&#x27;ve asked a tough question.<p>The page says the owner is looking to transfer to business to a new owner. I presume the owner wants the software to continue to be developed.<p>If there&#x27;s an existing customer base, and existing revenue based on proprietary sales, then that&#x27;s a monetary incentive for someone else to take over.<p>If the software is made open source, then part of that goes away. I have no idea what the market situation is for that product, but it comes down to asking what the benefits are.<p>Yes, there are moral ones (à la Stallman), but &quot;open source&quot; tends to focus on the software development advantages, eg, more potential contributors, more popularity leading to secondary income, etc.<p>In practice, these rarely occur. It&#x27;s just that it does occur for the most popular and well-known packages.<p>So it seems much harder to find a developer willing to take on open-source development of a package like this, than one willing to keep it proprietary.<p>At best there might be an appeal to history, &quot;if you aren&#x27;t able to find anyone to take it on, then would you release the source in a version that lets someone in the future see it&quot;?<p>That&#x27;s tricky because it&#x27;s an emotional appeal, at an emotional time, and you don&#x27;t seem to have an existing connection to the author to build upon (&quot;stumbling across this website&quot; means you likely aren&#x27;t even using the software), nor something tangible to offer.<p>Now, it&#x27;s possible that someone here could be interested, but it seems not only unlikely (few discussions here concern retail sales of Windows desktop apps, or the underlying technology, and those that know those skills likely have existing careers), but doubly-unlikely as it seems there&#x27;s little reason to think it&#x27;s worth the effort even to consider the possibility."

At a personal&#x2F;family level, it&#x27;s typically you using it, and modifying it if needed, once every other year or so, with literally nobody looking at it in between. Chances are you&#x27;ve done and are doing enough bash that you rarely look up its syntax. When was the last time you used terraform&#x2F;ansible?<p>Lindy Effect (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Lindy_effect"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Lindy_effect</a>) says bash will outlive all other recent solution.<p>Full story
I went through this phases:<p>- full crazy pxe install + Debian&#x2F;Ubuntu preseed, etc... But still needed some bash scripts. It required a lot of work from one OS version to the next. There were enough changes between versions of the pxe server that I had to revisit its config every time!<p>- I eventually bought a laptop for one of my kid that didn&#x27;t support pxe. I installed the base OS with a USB key, and realised how easy it was, and that it was significantly less painful to install half a dozen laptops this way, than fighting my pxe server. My install became USB OS install + well, my good old bash scripts!<p>- I got involved with ansible very early on and decided to solve both world hunger and global warming with it, but more importantly, my laptop installs. I spent many hours on this. Got it fully automated, and felt great!<p>- one of my kids&#x27; laptop got destroyed, buy a new one, install from USB stick, fumble to install ansible, and realise that ansible has by now changed significantly and my scripts need a lot of work. This is in the middle of the school year, while super busy at work, I just don&#x27;t have time to deal with this. But, there&#x27;s a great news: I still have my old bash scripts, and guess what, they still work.<p>- last upgrade:
I went from from my old dozen of bash scripts to this:

More significant: I sat down with my kids and get them to upgrade their laptops (which helped a lot to fix my documentation)!<p>PS: I have zero local files, everything is either on a cloud drive (pCloud), or on github if I want to keep history&#x2F;share it (eg: my dot files)."

Both were highly educated, from educated families. We called police and paramedics on one. They sent her to mental care and gave her the drugs needed, but the screeching and demonic voice still remained. Both were cured permanently when an exorcist came in.<p>Both friends said their bodies were out of their control and even surprised when they started talking to the exorcists. One had a very mother who was a highly educated medical doctor. She was the victim of such a thing in the past and paid a lot of money to fly in the exorcist.<p>A relative was sick for a week. She went to a high end hospital, ended up in intensive care, attended to by specialists. Treatment cost $3,000, and the hospital finally released her because they did everything they could and the insurance wouldn&#x27;t let her stay much longer. Another relative offered a spiritual treatment and her fever cooled within an hour.<p>Now you can call all these things coincidental, but the correlation seems very strong, whether exorcism is a first or last resort.<p>They seem a lot more dangerous in jungles, or areas that were cleared out from a former jungle or swamp.

Desks would switch about four times a year using a verifiably random scheme, and in addition, there would be projects that we would work on with random people, so we switched desks a lot. Each desk comes with a proper 2-screen desktop setup, so pulling out your laptop was inferior. Via PXE boot, people would regularly reinstall their system for various reasons, so it would regularly be a fresh Ubuntu install. An additional requirement was that others must still be able to work on my system without (m)any quirks.<p>Only a few of us used any sort of automation. Most that did chose Ansible, and all I ever heard from them was cursing on new systems and, between homework, constantly tweaking the deployment script. I&#x27;m sure the comments will say Ansible works reliably and painlessly for them, but from what I&#x27;ve seen, it seems to take some time to get into it if you want to setup GUI systems in detail.<p>What worked extremely well for me was a shell script that I grabbed from my server (wget example.com&#x2F;setup.sh), ran, switched user account, ran step 2 (since it mounts the user&#x27;s homedir, you don&#x27;t want to do that while logged in), and then logged back into my real account. After less than 5 minutes of manual work, I had my desired software, the right desktop environment, task bar &#x2F; alt tab &#x2F; system tray &#x2F; clock &#x2F; etc. settings, and I mounted my homedir on a local server, which was fast enough to painlessly run virtual machines with GUI OSes off of it. I would be as productive and comfortable as on my private laptop after a few minutes of work in the worst case. The script took a few hours to create at first, and with a new Ubuntu release maybe another hour to make it work on the mix of old and new systems. The advantage over other people&#x27;s setups was that anyone could wipe my system without a second thought (usually you&#x27;d have to ask the desk&#x27;s owner, they&#x27;d want to copy files...) and others couldn&#x27;t snoop through my files (at least, not opportunistically: they&#x27;d have to purposefully install a keylogger rather than just &quot;sudo; ls &#x2F;home&#x2F;lucb1e&quot;) so I can jot down thoughts or save passwords in Thunderbird without worrying.<p>In a more common scenario (not shared systems that are regularly wiped), you&#x27;d leave out the mounting of the homedir and copy essential files instead, such as your bashrc&#x2F;vimrc. Using a simple shell script is something I still recommend to manage setting up personal systems. It&#x27;s what you would do anyway, except stored in a file instead of typing the commands manually. So that&#x27;s what I still use today, though I don&#x27;t switch systems often enough to warrant maintaining commands for GUI configuration preferences (which can be a pain to figure out how to set from the command line). My current setup script is included in my bashrc (which I copy together with a .vimrc) and mainly pulls packages. I specify which categories I want, e.g. if the system has WiFi it&#x27;ll install wavemon, or if the system has a GUI it&#x27;ll install wireshark and xdotool."

2019-08-11,"Think about what Earth was like 50 million years ago. It was the Eocene &quot;New Dawn&quot; period. India was just starting to join Asia (physically, in the tectonic sense). The Cretaceous-Tertiary extinction saw one or more asteroids kill off most of the dinosaurs. Both North and South poles were forested and Alaska was a rain forest. Grass was a new member in the evolutionary family tree.  Primates started appearing, and mostly dwarf species thrived.<p>If you think about what the fossils from this time period looked like, you can pretty much guess what your message will look like to a future finder in a similar time scale. What you can&#x27;t guess is what any life form will look like, because nearly nothing alive that long ago even looked like it does today. And we should expect that in the same time period going forward.<p>Buildings from only a couple thousand years ago are barely recognizable until we dig cleanly around them, and we can&#x27;t even figure out half of the features we find in them.<p>Imagine such longer time scales. The digging will be a <i>lot</i> deeper. Tectonics and natural flora cycles will ensure that everything we were has been ground up and recycled repeatedly. It will be nigh impossible to find anything more intelligible than the 50 million year old fossils we find today.<p>But all is not in vain. With how over populated the Earth is right now, they&#x27;ll find a whole lot of human-based crude oil to run whatever kind of automobiles they&#x27;re driving by then."

2019-08-10,"Hi folks, I recently left Google (8 years, 4 months, 4 days :)) and co-founded a deep learning startup. We’re building a large scale model to learn human behavior and detect, predict, and explain suspicion and fraud. Our focus is on insurance involving human beings, accidents and their health - such as disability, workers’ compensation and other areas.<p>“Insurance” may sound like a boring problem domain, but it’s far from that. On the ethical side, it’s a huge problem, with estimated $40B-$80B paid out to fraud annually, with very little recourse to the fraudsters. And we’re all paying for it. The detection process today is almost entirely manual&#x2F;human intuition based, not data driven. Our mission is to put a stop to this loop hole by leveraging large historical data sets and deep learning and introducing a modern, systematic real-time detection approach. We put it in the hands of professional detectives. We provide realtime monitoring, alerts, explanations and supporting evidence.<p>The data set is a time series of events starting with an accident + injury, followed up by many diagnosis, interviews, witness statements, medical reports; treatments, with some final outcome. The outcome can be a full recovery, partial disability or a permanent disability.<p>This time series is represented by a large structured as well as large unstructured corpus (10s of millions of documents). The problem domain is super interesting - we’re building a real world “Minority Report” to stop bad actors from abusing the system, and help the good actors get paid immediately, and stop bad medical providers from doing evil.<p>There is a lot of interesting NLP work. The data sets you’d be working with involve individual demographics, job histories, geography mapping, health history, injury causes, recovery and treatment methods, objective witness statements and subjective claimant reports, industry codes, criminology, graph theory and workplace safety, to name a few.<p><a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.propublica.org&#x2F;article&#x2F;health-insurers-make-it-easy-for-scammers-to-steal-millions-who-pays-you"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.propublica.org&#x2F;article&#x2F;health-insurers-make-it-e...</a>

We are super early so you’re getting in on the ground floor, but we are well funded (closed a large seed round recently from several top-tier VC’s in SF and NYC). We already have a large data set and a customer and are seeing early success with our initial model. Our office is in the middle of Manhattan.<p>You’d be working along side industry experts and researchers. We’re building a company culture taking the best engineering and cultural practices from Google and mixing in the freedom of working at a startup.<p>You can publish white papers and speak at conferences. We’re working closely with Google (TF + cloud teams) so you’ll also get access to that resource. You can use your favorite tools, including PyTorch and FastAI, and get access to powerful VM’s.<p>If you’re interested in the current position, or want to reach out and stay in touch for when we start hiring again, or want to collaborate because you’re working on a similar problem, connect with me on linkedin (mention hn&#x2F;yc) or email me: tomasv at deepfraud dot com."

These courses are made to spit people out to the easiest part of the market: start ups and other (small) businesses willing to pay little and receive a lot.<p>Learning PHP, Python or Java for back-end development is ineffective for Bootcamp courses and bootcampers.

There is also <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;facebook&#x2F;create-react-app"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;facebook&#x2F;create-react-app</a> which is super popular but I don&#x27;t recommend it. (Because it&#x27;s based on Weback and I believe that Parcel will eventually become the state of the art to build web assets.)<p>If you need SSR then <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;zeit&#x2F;next.js"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;zeit&#x2F;next.js</a>.<p>If you are not sure whether you need an SPA or SSR, let me know. I&#x27;m happy to elaborate.<p>Another option is to use to the web framework I&#x27;m building (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;reframejs&#x2F;reframe"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;reframejs&#x2F;reframe</a>). The nice thing about it is that it allows you to build an SPA as well as an SSR app. And even better is that you can start with an SPA and easily switch to SSR later and vice versa. This means that you can start hacking today while later deciding whether SPA or SSR is right for you.
So my (biased) recommendation would be to use Reframe. Although Reframe is new and if you&#x27;re not an early adopter, then it&#x27;s probably nothing for you right now.<p>&gt;  a plethora of frameworks, transpiled languages, etc such as: Gulp, Typescript, JSX, Dart, Angular, React, Bootstrap, Babel, Wordpress, Drupal, Flutter, NPM, Web assembly, Vue.js, Minification of code before deploying, jQuery, and a gazillions others<p>I recommend to start with the simplest setup possible and later decide if you want to add niceness to your stack. That is: JavaScript with Parcel, Next.js, or Reframe. You&#x27;ll eventually realize over time what you need or not.<p>And I wouldn&#x27;t even start with bootstrap, instead I would use CSS flexbox.<p>As for API between your frontend and backend you can use <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;reframejs&#x2F;wildcard-api"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;reframejs&#x2F;wildcard-api</a>. It&#x27;s another thing I built and it&#x27;s much much easier than GraphQL and REST. Which is neat to get up and running quickly.<p>In a nutshell: start with minimalistic simple stack. You&#x27;ll figure all the rest later while building your app.<p>&gt; Auth support (custom and Google OAuth)<p>Just curious -- why do you need custom auth? Why not social login only?"

2019-08-09,"I think the interviewing method depends on the role. If it is a senior developer role that requires solid knowledge of a specific technology, I would absolutely value their ability to write code.

2019-08-09,"I am also above the 40 mark, but I think it is about how you present yourself more than anything.  What you are interested in doing etc.  There is quite a bit of agism in tech, but I find that the cultures that have it are usually the ones to avoid anyway, so it is kind of a filter for me.<p>I spent years consulting vs freelancing and the age helps when consulting.  Consultants are experts and hired for advice and a specific task usually.  Freelancers will be treated like an employee without all the benefits.  One is not equal to the other.<p>If you are going the freelancing route age&#x2F;experience can be more of a question that is hard for people to ask, so just address it early.  Usually the first opportunity to address it is in your position statement part of your cover letter.  e.g. I really enjoy staying on the technical implementation side of the equation... or something to that effect.  This lets them know where you are comfortable and either they&#x27;ll reach out if that fits or not.  But everyone does the math when they see how many years you&#x27;ve been working, it is hard not to.<p>As for your questions, at least from my point of view:<p>1. Age can increase the likelihood you&#x27;ll be overlooked, so you need to make sure your presentation on your resume and cover letter is solid.  Experiment with it too.  Although I think as a freelancer it is a little less likely to cause you grief.<p>2. Pay is based on experience most places so people may. The reality is unless you are crushing things at a large company you are probably stuck near the same pay you had 10 years ago anyway.  This is kinda typical if you stay technical and don&#x27;t move into management.<p>3. Consultants are definitely different than freelancers.  I built consulting agencies as my startups, and that was always how I sold myself.  Freelancer is a dev for hire, a consultant is an expert.  That is how I always found it, so I always avoided freelancer positions as being a consultant increased my fee by multitudes and increased how I was viewed.  You have to decide who you are and what services you are providing.<p>4.  Only if you want to, many places you can still code and not have to worry about being in management.  But mentoring junior roles will likely be expected.<p>5. I love this one.  When I interviewed 4 years back at the startup I am at now, I literally walked into a place where the average age of the team were within 2-3 years of my son.  I think it was a little more awkward for them. They are essentially interviewing someone their parents age and were probably more nervous then I was.  My personal style &amp; opinion is to disarm everyone and have a little fun with it, there is no hiding the facts, just don&#x27;t let them get in the way of the person.  Age is a number, how you approach them, how you act is far more important."
2019-08-09,"Some differences between then and now are also different idioms such as CSS naming conventions.<p>See GetBEM.com - for Block, Element, Modifier naming.<p>For instance, current conventions are to put a class name on far more HTML elements than years earlier, and avoid using hierarchical specifiers.  (Yes, I know, at first it may seem to defeat the <i>cascading</i> within &quot;CSS&quot; without the hierarchy, but it&#x27;s more nuanced than first glance.)  It&#x27;s especially useful when hiring front-end&#x2F;UI developers to maintain the project after your initial build, as many will have learned BEM at various coding bootcamps."
2019-08-09,Yes you’ll look weird
2019-08-09,"A bunch of my current company’s backend is in JS on node. I’m not sure it’s so bad.<p>I’ve had a different experience that most didn’t know much programming, but understood some typical webapp patterns.<p>If more bootcampers came out with a solid understanding of programming principles and software engineering basics, the language they knew wouldn’t matter as much.<p>Edit: I’ll also add that yes, they probably are looking for a job quickly, and that should be OK. Many bootcampers are trying to improve their lives by making a drastic change in their career. I think bootcamps set students’ expectations too high. They apply for as many jobs as they can without really knowing if they are a good fit. Often they’re not but there is some company out there that needs a jr web dev who would love to help them develop their skills and career. It’s just probably a bad idea to go for early and mid stage startups."

2019-08-09,"As someone who more or less recently did this, I can tell you about my journey. I went from fulldev LAMP stack (with some JQuery) to Vue ... which immediately got me embroiled webpack config files, linters, Babel, ES5+ES6 syntax and all the rest. Vue is great and pretty quick to pick up the basics, but as soon as you try to veer off the tutorial train you start finding unhelpful code examples that require a bevy of alternative things to learn and the stack keeps getting bigger and wider in every direction. As someone who started learning webdev in the Perl days when you couldn&#x27;t just Google answers, this was the worst part of picking up new things - there is no &quot;one path&quot; to do anything, everyone uses a slightly different stack and all these tools are intertwined in a way that makes progress very tedious without direct guidance.<p>For example, I learned the basics of Vue then tried to hack something together. But all the example code I found was using single file components (SFC) which is an alternative file structure for Vue that I had to learn first in order to make sense of the code samples. Then I needed to setup Webpack for some reason or another and Babel just seemed useful, so I spent a while in config hell learning all about those. In order to keep things simple I tried to avoid learning Vuex and Vue Router but I kept finding sample code that used both to the point I ended up learning them in order to unroll code samples, then I learned about event busses as an in-between solution to passing data around - at which point I decided I might as well just use Vuex after all. But it was frustrating to have to learn a big stack of things from a side channel to really understand code I was reading... I dare you to find a Vue tutorial&#x2F;sample beyond a basic introduction that doesn&#x27;t use some combination of those things.<p>That being said, I ended up going a step further and now I&#x27;m using the Quasar Framework. Quasar is like a wrapper around Vue that lets me avoid fussing with Webpack&#x2F;Babel&#x2F;Linters&#x2F;SASS&#x2F;hot reloading configs and I would have probably been better off doing a basic Vue tutorial then going right to Quasar. It also simplifies the frontend with integrated material design and that has always been the tedious side of doing full stack stuff for me, especially when fussing around with early stage ideas.<p>So, finally, getting to the plusses: Hot reloading lets me edit&#x2F;upload a file and have the webpage change beneath me without even refreshing, that&#x27;s pretty cool. Frontend work is much, much better and simplified. I rarely have to fuss with positioning CSS nightmares or worry about different screen sizes or browser differences because that is all abstracted away from me, and I am fine with that. And once it is setup with Vuex, the API-style data communication to the backend is a simple and clean way to separate the front&#x2F;back.<p>OAuth has turned out to be a hairier beast than it has any right to be, but for me that is still a work in progress. Any advice on a simple solution for that would be appreciated!"

2019-08-09,"&gt; What is a minimal set of JS&#x2F;CSS frameworks, templating engine, deployment tools, IDE I need?<p>None. You don&#x27;t need any of that to build a modern web site. The web is still, at its core, HTTP requests that send text to a browser, that in turn renders what it receives. Even though web site do more these days, they still run JavaScript to do it, which you can still code in a basic text editor.<p>The better question is what problem do each of the modern tools solve, and which of those problems matter to your goals? Odds are, yes, you&#x27;ll want some. And many people will tell you their favorite combo of tools and declare it to be the answer.<p>My recommendation is find your own answer, by first sticking with what you know, and adding one piece at a time. If you know python, stick with that. Django has its own toolkit, and it works. Whether or not you like it is up to you. But it is a starting point. You can always start from there, add on modern CSS. Bootstrap is at least decent to let you work with some recent CSS frameworks to see how they operate, but there are certainly other choices as well. React and Vue are popular, I believe for good reason, so I&#x27;d at least try a few tutorials to see how they strike you. Over the course of trying those, you&#x27;ll pick up webpack, babel, and npm, and get to understand the ecosystem.<p>If you play with one tech on the side each week, in a couple months you&#x27;ll better be able to answer those underlying questions of how each solution solved problems in web development. And you&#x27;ll be able to make your own choices of which ones you want to stick with."

I&#x27;m sure there are many other areas where you can create tremendous business value from the data in SAP, which SAP doesn&#x27;t pursue due to them being too &quot;niche&quot; for them or due to ignorance.

2019-08-09,"SAP, Oracle, IBM are purchased by CTOs because they have comfort that they are dealing with &quot;big enough companies to understand their enterprise needs&quot; - which translates to &quot;the sales reps have big expense accounts and wine and dine me&quot;. I have worked with all of the above vendors and I have seen that so much of the marketing budget goes towards &quot;entertainment&quot;, junkets, conferences, etc.<p>Besides buying from a big vendor makes them look good in the eyes of their credulous board. There is too much risk in being blamed for buying from an &quot;unproven vendor&quot;."

2019-08-09,"Start with Bootstrap.  Build as many sites as you can just using Bootstrap and then study what the classes are actually doing.  Then replicate the classes and make changes to them.  Bootstrap has enough that if you go through each thing it has, you will have a decent appreciation for the look and how the CSS&#x2F;HTML&#x2F;JS fits together to make a site.  Then start using jQuery heavily.  Find jQuery modules and use them. Play with the options.  Then start playing with the code.  Those 2 things will be good enough to then move on to something more complicated; which ultimately is just abstracting these basics and attempt to make them easier.  But you have to already know what is happening if you don&#x27;t want to get confused as to why you are using the tool and what your other options are besides this tool."

They can also be a problem if the job they are interviewing for doesn&#x27;t have a performative aspect similar to the performance found in the interview.

2019-08-09,"Freelancer here, 58 years old with almost 40 years experience, 10 as a freelancer&#x2F;consultant.<p>To succeed as a freelancer or consultant you have to build a reputation for delivering results and a network of contacts. You don’t want to apply for jobs or go through interviews. You want clients to find you and not ask anyone else to bid on jobs.<p>I don’t think what you call yourself matters. In the software business titles don’t mean much.<p>Customers outsource because they need specialized skills. Many small and medium-sized companies don’t have full-time staff, or can’t attract and keep people, so what qualifies as “specialized skills” can vary. One of my most lucrative clients pays me top rate to manage Wordpress sites.<p>Base your price&#x2F;rate on business value, not on what other people charge. Business problems have costs, risks, and time value, base your fees on those. Delivering results right away without hassling clients with lots of questions and irrelevant details has significant value to your clients. The more you understand their business and can fix things without supervision the more value you offer.<p>My customers pay for solutions so they expect me to solve business problems, not just write code. That means I do some project management and sometimes people management.<p>My age does not come up, I don’t think any client has asked. I work remotely, that helps."

Technological solutions could still be of use as follows:<p>1) predicting&#x2F;detecting behavioural problems well in advance of the individual(s) in question becoming locked into a violent path (this would be challenging on both technical and ethical&#x2F;privacy fronts)<p>2) more narrow-window prediction&#x2F;detection of violent intent, and&#x2F;or materials that would constitute threat to life (guns, as a prime example) and immediate notification of first responders. Essentially what some folks call a &quot;sense and respond&quot; system.<p>3) Environmental deterrents&#x2F;safeguards coupled to the detection systems described in (2) above.<p>A multi-pronged strategy would likely deliver the best outcomess w.r.t minimising the loss of life. Solutions at each level could also be re-purposed for emergencies that aren&#x27;t gun related, so the overall benefit to society would be meaningful.<p>Disclosure: I founded a startup over a year ago with the express purpose of solving such problems (== preventing loss of life in violent scenarios in general) and had to shut it down due to lack of funding. I have thought about these issues for a couple of years now and have some specific ideas on the subject. Happy to discuss further with anyone interested in collaborating, pointing me to funding opportunities etc."

2019-08-08,"On the ageism - I feel for you man.<p>But I recommend not doing one. You are skilled enough that you could dedicate yourself to 3 to 6 months of serious study of the technologies you are interested in. Teach yourself by doing projects that interest you, and then use those projects as evidence of enthusiasm and experience.<p>Boot camps might be beneficial if you don’t feel capable of teaching yourself, but they will have so much training-wheels stuff that you are well past so it will be a mixed bag of value. Plus it costs a lot of money.<p>I don’t think the fact you did a bootcamp will increase your value much. Certainly not as much as self study and projects in a public git repo."
2019-08-08,"Where do you want to go? It sounds like you are implying you want to get back to the technical work? If the job does not allow, then you may need to find a role.

During the time I&#x27;ve been using it, various features have come and gone. Just in the past couple months, it has changed appearance on me 3 times. It&#x27;s amazing that they&#x27;ll do that but won&#x27;t provide a setting to allow you to disable something that&#x27;s clearly and understandably annoying some users.<p>All I can say is that I&#x27;m glad it doesn&#x27;t bother me as much as it bothers some people.

As you said, should I make a &quot;next-gen&quot; version, and if so, should I deprecate the old version (I think this might be a good approach)<p>3. are there developers who, if given a nudge&#x2F;opportunity, could help in this clean up?<p>Just some thoughts."
2019-08-08,You&#x27;re supposed to post the original source. Have you tried using a filter?
2019-08-08,I think HN takes a pragmatic approach. There is quality news on those paywalled sites. They are paywalled because they need to pay professionals to write quality researched content (it isn’t some internet marketer trying to make a quick buck) so ethically it seems OK and there are workarounds.<p>I think there would be a natural balance in that a paywalled article needs to be even better than average to do well as fewer people can read it to upvote it. So hopefully when a paywalled article appears it’s better than average.<p>Medium.com is my only concern because they paywall run of the mill blog quality articles. I’d encourage people to post using a friends link in that case if they can get it.
2019-08-08,"Post modern ERPs are loosely coupled entities instead of large monolithic apps. This allows for companies to more easily assemble best of breed solutions (eg SFDC + Workday + Infor +...). This allows a lower barrier to entry.  Pretty sure this shift combined with disruption theory by Prof Christensen provides a roadmap to do something here (vertical or industry focus, SMB focus, etc)<p>That being said, SAP continues to innovate and the switching costs of ERPs (especially highly customized installations) are incredibly sticky. There’s no easy answer. It would take incredible and consistent execution, one win at a time, over 10 years."
2019-08-08,"Contrary to others here, I would still suggest to stick with Erlang, but use Elixir&#x27;s toolkit.<p>You can use `mix`, `exunit`, release, etc... from Elixir, and they can handle your Erlang codes fine. You also have better integration with editors like VSCode.<p>The reason for sticking with Erlang is that your project can be used in both Erlang and Elixir community. But if you write pure Elixir, it&#x27;s pretty hard to use it in Erlang.<p>You can also write Elixir macro to wrap your Erlang code in an API. Not the other way around.<p>Project structure between Erlang and Elixir is similar anyway, so it should not be too difficult to have one single project for both Erlang and Elixir code."
2019-08-08,"I can give you my anecdote of a similar situation. I was pigeonholed into a job using legacy tech a couple years ago. I quit because it was a dead end. I found a company willing to let me learn modern tools on-the-job, which I did. That ended up not panning out in the long run because of work&#x2F;life balance. But that is when the story gets interesting:<p>My next job was the old job. I got hired back into the job I quit, but instead of being stuck on the old tech, I&#x27;m working on modernizing multiple old products, including my own legacy products, into new tech.<p>It wasn&#x27;t the original plan, but it ended up being a 12 month sabbatical to modernize myself."

Ask for 5%, settle for 3+%<p>and this comment:<p>&gt; I feel you’re closer to “somewhat co-founder” status if you’ve contributed to major milestones over 5 months, especially without pay and no major investment. Assuming you’re negotiating pre-money and you’ll get a non-competitive salary; id like to see at least 10%. Consider you will be diluted very soon.<p>Anywhere from 3% - 10% I&#x27;d say is a reasonable number, pretty much depending on who&#x27;s the better negotiator."
2019-08-08,If you think that’s “blatantly ignoring users in favor of A&#x2F;B testing” definitely don’t look into what your average growth team does.<p>It looks harmless and possibly a morale booster for some. So what if you’re not the intended audience? Close it and move on.
2019-08-08,"Hmm, that $100K stretch goal is pretty much required for me to be able to use this instead of a yubikey.

But I know lots of people believe in the whole &#x27;trusted&#x27; movement. And I suppose having a &#x27;hacker&#x27; version &#x2F;available&#x2F; is at least a bit better than what yubico offers."

Why not try doing things that don&#x27;t require coding skills, and try doing more point-and-click things. Personally I only code if I <i>really</i> have to and my livelihood depends on it (but luckily I can now afford not to code and focus on other things). I recently switched to doing social media marketing for a small handful of clients. It&#x27;s good money for what is essentially managing a few Twitter &amp; Facebook accounts :)"

2019-08-08,"Nice work! This is a great idea and something I&#x27;ve thought should exist since getting interested in CBT a few months back. Before even trying the app, here are some thoughts.<p>- On pricing: $4&#x2F;mo seems like a difficult price point to build a business around, and it doesn&#x27;t reflect the value you&#x27;re offering. People pay hundreds&#x2F;thousands per month to therapists to improve their mental health. If outcomes from using your app compare favorably to a therapist, shouldn&#x27;t your pricing reflect that? $4&#x2F;mo makes me think &#x27;toy&#x27;, not serious therapeutic tool. For people to be willing to pay <i>anything</i> for an app like this, they have to be convinced it can really work. But if they <i>are</i> convinced, they&#x27;ll pay a whole lot more than $4&#x2F;mo. I would consider freemium (so people can try it out and see the value) and then a much higher price point (maybe $50-100&#x2F;mo?). You might get undercut by competing apps, but if you&#x27;re clearly the best one, I think many people will want the best option and won&#x27;t be very price-sensitive if they believe it can really help.<p>- On branding: while it&#x27;s important to mention that the app is based on CBT so you can piggyback on the awareness people already have about CBT, I think referring to it as a &quot;Cognitive Behavioral Therapy app&quot; severely restricts your market to people who already know what that means, which I&#x27;d guess is a very small slice of the people who could benefit. I would try to lead with the benefits--feel better quickly; easier, cheaper, more effective than a therapist; evidence-based; etc.--and save the more technical&#x2F;jargony stuff about CBT for supporting info.<p>- On stigma: I would also try to avoid positioning this as something mainly for people experiencing a &#x27;mental illness&#x27; like clinical depression&#x2F;anxiety, but rather something that <i>everyone</i> can benefit from and use to feel better and improve their lives, regardless of how they currently feel. I think many people who don&#x27;t consider themselves to have a serious problem still engage in cognitive distortions and could see major benefits from using CBT techniques, so I would try to include these people in your messaging as well. While going from bad mood to good mood is obviously valuable and desirable, so is going from good mood to great mood. But if you make it seem like using the app is effectively self-identifying as &#x27;mentally ill&#x27; or even just &#x27;feeling bad&#x27;, many folks in the latter camp will be turned off, so that&#x27;s something to be careful about."

2019-08-08,"No, do not do a bootcamp. As others have said bootcamps are for people who have never coded before.

It sounds like you are itching for a more fast paced (to use a cliche) environment so I would recommend you start looking at other companies to work for while trying to learn the skills necessary for those jobs.<p>That said, if its mainly salary that you&#x27;re concerned about then 150k is a pretty good amount. Even in more &quot;trendy&quot; companies - there is a ceiling to how much developers earn, AFAIK the only way to earn more than ~200k as a developer is to work for a FAANG company.<p>Finally, don&#x27;t think that just because you heard one story about somebody who got a 150k job straight out of bootcamp that this is the norm.

2019-08-08,"I&#x27;ve used a couple of principles regarding CBT to become more social and to get a better dating life. The first book I read was Michael Hall&#x27;s Mindlines, which was an NLP book (a nonsense pseudoscience acronym). A couple of years later I learned about CBT and saw it has a lot in common with NLP. The biggest difference: CBT has scientific research into it and NLP doesn&#x27;t, a couple of people simply made it up. When I tackled these problems I was 16, around 18 I was a lot more scientific about this.<p>The key insights regarding CBT for me were the following:<p>1. Start with small goals and celebrate them.<p>2. Log the following questions:<p>A. To what extent do I think event foo or thought bar will happen? E.g. to what extent do I think I&#x27;ll get ridiculed while introducing myself to this new group of people?<p>B. (after it happened) what actually happened and to what extent was this in line with my expectations? After doing it for 10 times, 5 groups were cold and generally non-responsive, 1 ridiculed me and 4 were very friendly and happy to have met me (from experience this would be a particularly worst case realistic example for me).<p>3. I&#x27;ve used this so many times: if you feel terrible, ask yourself whether you&#x27;re having the right perspective. If you feel like you do, then ask yourself it&#x27;s the only right perspective. If you feel you do, see if you can find other perspectives anyway and ask yourself whether those perspectives gave you new information. This did wonders on how I viewed my physical attractiveness. My opinion used to be: I&#x27;m ugly. My opinion now is quite nuanced and grouped into segments by age and personality type. Conclusion: the people I like either don&#x27;t care (too much) or they find me attractive. It took me a long time to this conclusion. For a long time I had another one which was: I&#x27;m not that good looking but looks don&#x27;t matter too much in dating, or at least not when people meet me.<p>Those 3 insights really helped.<p>It&#x27;s funny, I also studied psychology but that never really helped as much in this area as CBT before it.<p>---<p>If you guys feel up for it, then send me an email (see my profile) to reach out to brainstorm on things regarding CBT&#x2F;psychology, dev or UX. I thought this was completely solved but apparently it isn&#x27;t.<p>I wish there were more positive psychology[1]&#x2F;tech companies on the whoishiring thread, if I weren&#x27;t applying for McKinsey right now, I&#x27;d have publicly asked to see whether I could help you guys out.<p>[1] While CBT isn&#x27;t part of positive psychology, I feel they&#x27;re quite close to the spirit of it which is why I include it."
2019-08-08,"Are you sure you need a bootcamp? It sounds like you are selling yourself short and&#x2F;or not getting job prospects in the right fields. As someone who recently was reviewing resumes bootcamps are so variable in quality that they are in the same boat to me as no-name certifications. A bootcamp is just making the time to spend dedicated effort for you to learn something and it&#x27;s only going to give you as much as you put in. If you&#x27;ve spoken to people and heard success stories it&#x27;s likely not because they went to the bootcamp but they used that time effectively- this is the common advice for any of these short-term career shift sort of programs for any industry.<p>Are you sure that AI or large scale systems actually exists in the markets you are looking for? Not all markets support the same industries and as you would probably know the number of times it&#x27;s just lip service and held together in the back with cellotape is still amazingly high. To really get into this sorts of things you would probably be having to pursue a role labeled as architect if it wasn&#x27;t a market where these things were relevant. The kind of job you are looking for probably isn&#x27;t being posted in a place you can find it, and I have found that recruiters are the gatekeepers not any public posting. I haven&#x27;t tried cold messaging recruiters of companies I am interested in on LinkedIn but I think that&#x27;s probably what I would do, you could also cold message engineers working in something you find exceptionally interesting.<p>Try some of the alternative sites like hired.com where it just isn&#x27;t blindly submitting resumes.<p>Are you just interviewing poorly? Is your resume even relevant? I remember reviewing someone&#x27;s resume last year that still had Windows 98 as a skill. As just a general resume trend listing every version of a thing you know is less popular than listing the types of skills you have and if they want further details be ready to provide it.<p>From the salary side are you just capped out for the market? There are definitely some places where 150k is the ceiling that&#x27;s very hard to break without some sort of exceptional relationship with you as an individual and the employer, or an industry that just happens to command higher salaries. If you want to get into say 250k town in a 150k market you&#x27;ve got to be doing something differently than just being a tech lead and trying to climb the ladder.<p>A couple weekends to get up to speed so you can talk to the interviewer at the same level will always do better than &#x27;I can catch up&#x27; but in the conversation it is clear you are missing the big picture. Someone who is living and breathing the problem but just needs to switch gears to actually apply themselves to it will go to the top of the stack versus someone who is like &#x27;teach me.&#x27; So many people show up to interviews and show only passing interest in the work to be done and the conversation. Don&#x27;t be that person."

Basically, you can set up the Lotus Bud app to check in randomly during the day (window of time, and frequency are both configurable) and invite you to &quot;clear&quot; for a moment.

2019-08-08,"I would recommend you learn by doing, one step at a time.<p>Here is an example path that builds skills on top of each other, mostly geared towards programming, based on the background info you provided:<p>1. Create Tic Tac Toe. This will get you familiar with the core game loop. Read input, update game state, draw, repeat. It is a bounded project so you can finish it. Finishing projects is a skill on its own. If you want to use C or C++ have a look at Simple DirectMedia Layer (SDL) or Simple and Fast Multimedia Library (SFML). These libraries abstract OS functions like reading inputs and putting pixels on the screen so you can focus on the core game mechanics. If you want to use Python look at PyGame, for example. The industry mostly uses C++ with Visual Studio so keep that in mind if you want to join a company later on.
Here you can find some tutorials on SDL: <a href=""http:&#x2F;&#x2F;lazyfoo.net&#x2F;tutorials&#x2F;SDL&#x2F;index.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;lazyfoo.net&#x2F;tutorials&#x2F;SDL&#x2F;index.php</a><p>2. Create Pong or Breakout or any such 2D game with familiar mechanics. Then asteroids. Then battle city. Then super mario land. Each of these on its own teaches you a skill that you didn&#x27;t have before. If you find yourself repeating the same code, abstract it away. This is the beginning of a game engine - a small framework of reusable components from game to game.<p>3. Once you have done enough 2D projects that you feel like you have a good grip on most components individually and how they come together as a whole, move on to 3D. Read Game Engine Architecture. Read good open source game code like the doom3 <a href=""http:&#x2F;&#x2F;fabiensanglard.net&#x2F;doom3&#x2F;index.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;fabiensanglard.net&#x2F;doom3&#x2F;index.php</a>
Create small graphics demos where you can learn how to use shaders - shaderToy is helpful here. Create 3D Tetris.<p>4. By this point you will know enough about games to be dangerous. You will know what is most interesting to you. Maybe it&#x27;s AI, or graphics, or physics, etc. Create demos and games that showcase that field you are really interested in. Try and partner up with people with complementary skills to yours.<p>There are many ways to learn game development, the one I&#x27;d recommend the most is the one that seems most interesting to you and gets you actually creating and finishing games."

2019-08-08,"Based on his admiration of Metafilter’s moderation and how much has been written in Metatalk about how their moderation works I’d say he spends a lot of time responding to flags and emailed notes, watches new and some special lists&#x2F;views, and maybe keeps open the few threads he intuits to be contentious (possibly with access to a linear view of comments being added to an article, and extra metadata appearing?)<p>Good, efficient moderation requires internal tooling and view development."

Learning to setup a Windows machine for Java development is difficult if you aren&#x27;t familiar with environment variables and the like.<p>Java, like C++, has gotten more and more features&#x2F;keywords over the years. Frameworks like Spring Boot tend to make use of those features. Also, Spring Boot is a sit down and read the guides compared to something like Rails or ExpressJS and the like. Depending on your Java knowledge the documentation is going to be hit or miss I think. Also, convention over configuration makes it harder for new developers to get the hang of developing with a framework like Spring Boot because they don&#x27;t know the conventions usually."

2019-08-07,"I personally would make a different suggestion here:
1) set up a new corp as soon as possible to be able to track business expenses right away, issue stock, etc
2) use an S-CORP instead of an LLC. All those additional “processes” people usually mention are really just “good business,” not that difficult to keep up with, and ultimately will only add security especially if you will have cofounders &#x2F; investors.
3) use ONE corp for all your MVPs, track per-product costs nicely for each of them (Xero does it well), and only maybe spin them off into separate companies if&#x2F;when they succeed"

2019-08-07,"The biggest thing you can do if you have developers that work on one of your teams is actually care about security, listen to them when they say there is a risk, understand it, challenge it and then address it.  And if you or the business choose not to address a specific concern now, which can happen, go back to the team and explain the why of the decision to keep them in the loop -- this is not optional if you want the teams trust.  Personally, with my teams I make sure they get feedback on decisions as quickly and clearly as I can when the business makes a call on product etc. I always seemed to have frustration with the lack of feedback as a developer and work hard to prevent that on my teams.  A lot of times as a developer on a team (especially larger teams) it can feel like feedback is being given to the business but very little is coming back on decisions that are made.  If the devs understand the concerns or limitations as to the why, many times they can come up with ways to make mitigation still happen but within some constraints that benefits the business still and doesn&#x27;t let technical debt rack up.  Taking the team out of that loop means you will get frustrated developers that see&#x2F;feel that the company doesn&#x27;t care, so in the end, why should they, bad cycle to get into.<p>And I don&#x27;t think it can be said enough, do more than pay lip service to security.  Care about security and work with the team to identify and address areas where there are problems.  Especially in my experience startups always have this as a failure point.  I&#x27;ve yet to see a single startup get security right early on, not saying some don&#x27;t but almost always speed, getting investor dollars and &quot;well come back to it&quot; outweigh the security items raised. In the end this will always bite them, either in terms of cost to fix it later, or in embarrassment when it leaks or is hacked by a bored 14 yr old.  Think of how many major startups&#x2F;companies you can list that still had plain text passwords someplace, it is insane?  Good logging is not an excuse to abandon good security practices.<p>I could ramble for a long time on this, but hopefully that gives some ideas."

Use your leverage as &quot;extensive&quot; contributor up to this point. Once you start this negotiation you have to set a time limit (2 weeks?) to complete it and be nice about it but be clear you will not be making further contribution under the old terms.

2019-08-07,"Indie game designer here with a long history of self-education. My history isn&#x27;t really applicable any more but it may help with your journey.<p>With an interest in comic books and cartoons, I began practicing animation in the margin of my paperback books. Flip-books got me interested in Flash, and I spent some years learning basic frame-by-frame animation. Setting up menus and basic playback controls opened the doors to ActionScript, which got me started with choose-your-own-adventure animations. As I experimented with basic game mechanics, I started to play more games, and eventually turned to Java to learn &quot;real&quot; programming, where the concept of game loops and loading external images was introduced. After practicing on and off for years, Unity appeared and opened the doors to 3D game development (I was taking a computer graphics course in college around this time as well). I took some time to read up on level design, since I never really worked in 3D space prior to this. Since then, I&#x27;ve picked up bits and pieces of incorporating stronger media (textures, music, sfx) and polishing the user experience (more attention to the GUI and overlays). Most recently I&#x27;ve added analytics and other metrics to improve my understanding of how users behave. Funny enough after all that, now I&#x27;m designing tabletop games.<p>That&#x27;s my journey, at least.<p>Comic books -&gt; Cartoons -&gt; Paper animation -&gt; 2D Digital animation -&gt; Scripting games -&gt; Developing games -&gt; Using external assets -&gt; 3D games -&gt; Level design -&gt; Low-level concepts -&gt; Polishing media use -&gt; Polishing GUI -&gt; Analytics -&gt; Tabletop"

And look for patio11 posts, as he has posted alot about money and getting more of it. I think the golden nugget is don&#x27;t tell a future employer what you are earning now. My advice - don&#x27;t be embarrassed to be earning double what you are earning now for doing the same thing somewhere else.<p>Options to think about: Contracting, Skills that pay more (React?), Companies that can pay more (trading companies? FAANG companies?), Cities that pay more, Countries that pay more, Roles that pay more (management, architect), Negotiation with current employer (will they pay more if you say you might leave).<p>Don&#x27;t trade your spare time for money. Trade time for making your time worth more money.<p>Also maybe cut your expenses more? The only time I&#x27;ve been in your situation as a dev is with a non working partner to support. If you are single, consider living in a shared house for example. Also I&#x27;m not a big earning like a lot of the HN crowd."

Come up with a small idea, make a prototype, and play it.  Ask yourself which parts are fun and which parts aren’t; make an adjustment and try again, or start over with a different game idea.<p>As you go through this process, you’ll necessarily need to acquire some technical skills, but they’ll each be in support of a specific outcome.

2019-08-07,"We needed recently translate our chrome extension (languagelearningwithnetflix.com) into 18 languages. We are poor and had less than $1000 for the job.<p>Here&#x27;s our approach.<p>1. Move all strings into a Google doc. Takes about 8 hours.<p>2. Organise strings into groups with screenshots, think carefully, split strings, look for reused strings, reword things to make them simpler and easier to translate, add notes to some strings to make the meaning more explicit. Very tedious part of job, 2-3 days work.<p>3. Put the doc, editable with link, onto upwork with a fixed payment, somewhat generous for translation wordcount. Check translator is a native in the target language, had some good feedback and ideally some IT&#x2F;programming experience. Order translations for the languages we can check ourselves (5-6 languages).<p>4. Check the translations received for issues. Translators typically misinterpret the same things, as the source was not clear enough. Fix these issues. Maybe 4 hours work.<p>5. Now send to 10+ other translators for the languages we don&#x27;t understand. Cross fingers that these will be ok.<p>6. Check translations of labels for homogenous usage of semicolons, capitals, fullstops etc. Struggle with zh&#x2F;ja&#x2F;ko.<p>7. Use a small JS script to transform CSV output from sheets to JSON for chrome.i18n.<p>8. Cycle through all locales and for overflowing text or other issues.<p>9. For any extra strings that we might need later, can try Microsoft UI translations database, or else, Google translate (which is mostly ok, can check the reverse translation).<p>Honestly this all was quite a lot of boring work, but we probably ended up with reasonable translations at a good price, and managed to pay translators reasonable money."

2019-08-07,"Just wanted to point out that typically in the US, the role you seem to be describing is that of an engineering manager, not a project manager.  If your company is finding engineering managers in 2-4 weeks, it probably is not a top-tier tech company.<p>At the highest paying tech companies (FANG) there are usually 3 &quot;manager&quot; roles:<p>- Product Manager: Interfaces between marketing, engineering and design to manage the development of new features and products.  Not necessarily a people manager and does not directly manager engineers.<p>- Project Manager: Manages scheduling, task assignment, communication between teams, assigns bugs.  Does not directly manage engineers.<p>- Engineering Manager: Primarily a people manager, usually was a SWE previously.  Does manage engineers.<p>Of the 3, the project manager path is probably the least lucrative at the same level.  Product and engineering tend to have similar pay.<p>Good engineering managers have a unique blend of managerial skill AND technical skill.  On the other hand, there are lots of anti-social weirdos that are great ICs in engineering.  As a result, I&#x27;m inclined to say that supply and demand is working pretty well."

2019-08-07,"My personal general rule is once you take money for the product&#x2F;service you should form the LLC, e.g. money should be deposited into a business account not your personal account.<p>I didn&#x27;t always have that rule, I used to do a few deals first and put the money in a separate personal account with maybe a DBA under my name at most (many times without that) then if things were looking good I&#x27;d move forward -- this is a good way to test.  But with the way the U.S. is and how litigious everyone is, the small price to gain a little extra buffer in the form of the LLC is not worth delaying.  Part of this will depend on the value of the product&#x2F;service and who it is serving.  But basically, if you take money and something happens you could personally become liable for it if you took the money personally.  If you are 25 and have no responsibilities or assets then that&#x27;s probably not a big deal.  If you are 40 have a family, kids, house, assets etc the math changes.

They&#x27;re experts, not only because of what they learned building Firebase, but also because they got insight into how our big customers ran their services and teams.<p>Vikrum actually built a browser plugin at Firebase that was simple but incredibly useful. It color-coded cloud settings pages for different environments (prod, staging, dev) to prevent someone from accidentally changing the config in prod when they didn&#x27;t mean to. We required the whole Firebase team to use it, and it honestly saved us from multiple downtime incidents.<p>If you&#x27;re managing a service, I really suggest you try Gold Fig out.

2019-08-07,"I&#x27;ve had similar thoughts in the past. My conclusion was that education and misinformation is a <i>huge</i> problem these days, so part of my mental&#x2F;time resources are being spent trying to improve general &quot;information&quot; handling to people. Bad actors are doing too much, and the common person doesn&#x27;t have tooling to aid them against this endless stream of information.<p>I&#x27;m working on this through implementation(s) that are centered around:<p>- A UX that focuses on small information <i>(the goal of being easy to consume, while linking back to source material to not lose context)</i><p>- distributed &#x2F; federated <i>(naturally sharable, not platform locked)</i><p>- immutable <i>(aspects of it can be immutable and source material from the internet should be archived into the system for permanent reference)</i><p>Point 2 and 3 are largely implementation details that I feel are important for a system. The first point, the UX of &quot;small&quot; information is an attempt at reducing the data load on humans these days. To expand:<p>We&#x27;ve got a world of information at our finger tips. I can spend hours digesting information and forming conclusions but not only do I need to mentally retain my work, but I have to mentally retain the components of my work to back up how I came to those conclusions. I find this extremely difficult. I believe it would be beneficial to promote people recording these conclusions, and conclusions from conclusions <i>(and so forth)</i>, in such a way that it can be easily shared, digested, debated further and improved upon.<p>While I&#x27;ve been slowly planning this for ages, recently I bumped into Kialo[1] and found their UI to be quite similar to what I had envisioned. notably how in the debate, statements are linked to other statements to breakdown conclusions into smaller, digestible components. This is tailored towards debates not specifically generic information, but I think it&#x27;s all meaningfully related.<p>My implementation is too early to share, but I&#x27;m speaking about this because I believe the information tooling is important to humans. If this interests you I look forward to your contributions in this space :)<p>I appreciate your desire to help humanity.<p><i>note</i>: I should note that my implementation has a bunch of technical aspects that may or may not be worth while to the overall goal. The distributed and immutable nature of the implementation might detract from the overall goal. I believe point 2 and 3 have merit though, but that debate is out of scope haha.<p>[1]: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.kialo.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.kialo.com</a>"

If you strip away all the supplementary features, you&#x27;re left with the minimum viable product.<p>Are the MVP features getting interest &amp; engagement? If so, it sounds like you need to double down on that and rethink those supplementary features. If not, you need to rethink your core features and figure out if it&#x27;s due to execution or a false premise. If the MVP is solid on its own, you should have people wanting to use it and possibly even pay for it. If that&#x27;s not the case even remotely, you might consider a pivot and maybe even a hard pivot.

Each in itself a role in production; however no harm in learning how to do at least a few. I will strong suggest starting with Blender (it&#x27;s free and great) and use CG Masters courses.<p>The other piece is bring your assets live through code. Again this has different roles:<p>- Gameplay programmer, Graphics Tools Programmer etc.<p>Here you have the option to learn from ground up or just learn the tools and API&#x27;s (Unity, Unreal etc). Ground up route is arduous but greatly beneficial as is anything when you derive from almost first principles. For this I would say:<p>- Write an animation loader which can read skeletal animation and play it<p>- Write a mini game engine which supports animation, physics and sound.<p>I have not listed the mandatory: GL, Vulkans, Metals, and DXes of the world to be learnt.<p>As listed in the other thread, what route you choose will heavily depend on your end goal. I would say though from personal experience, just learning to write games on the side is not only fun but also makes you a better programmer, the better part may not happen when you work on a real game though there are exceptions.<p>[1] Blender -<p>[2] CGMasters"

2019-08-06,"Who are the main developers who will be working on this project? If the developers are largely used to Node, or Ruby, the package management, and language features might make them more comfortable, and if they are not comfortable with C++ already, the Rust learning curve might be negligible compared to some of the oddities with C++.<p>If you have developers coming from languages like Java or C# which have a structural similarity to C++, or if you have developers already familiar with C++, I would say that there is no need to throw that experience away, and that experience would get you guys farther than trying the new language.<p>In my experience, the clang compiler is very developer friendly in terms of error reporting and features. The only people that I know that say that C++ is old and clunky were those using gcc and C++98. Make is pretty open ended as a scripting tool&#x2F;build tool, and there are plenty of alternatives if you don&#x27;t like make.<p>I would choose based on demographics of your team. If you have a bunch of young developers, or if you want to hire a bunch of young developers, Rust is pretty popular with that crowd, and has a lot of language features that will make them feel comfortable. That being said, I only recommend Rust if you have a developer that is very comfortable with it, and can guide you through the borrow checker, whether to use stable or nightly rust, and the foreign function interface. C++ will require more discipline because there is less constraints that prevent you from shooting yourself in the face with code readability and memory safety, but it is proven, and if you have the C++ developers on hand, have them decide on a style guide and review process that works for your team."

2019-08-06,"Even bare metal hardware has potential vulnerabilities, eg Spectre &amp; Meltdown, micro-code bugs and management console back-channel attacks.  Hypervisors have been shown to be vulnerable to certain advanced attacks.  And there are no doubt, many zero-days that are yet to be discovered. Making an OS lighter by changing the implementation is likely to introduce unintended new vulnerabilities.<p>The OSes you mention have relatively small user base and thus their security models are relatively unproven.  I note that all of the environments you mention use Linux for the userland and thus you will have apps that also have potential security risks.<p>Perhaps it would be better to re-frame your question in terms of the requirements that you intend to address.  For example for highest level of security you could go with an OS like seL4 and rewrite everything to avoid Linux system vulnerabilities.  Probably not practical. And the rewrite is not guaranteed to be bug free.<p>The most secure environments are carefully specified and architected for their intended application. The more general purpose an environment the greater the number of potential vulnerabilities. It has been said that the most secure computer system is powered-off, disconnected from all communications and located in a locked and sealed underground vault in a remote off-the-grid location."

And maybe it can be crowdsourced.<p>From what I understand, these types of violent outbursts come from a feeling of isolationism paired with mental health issues. These people see those around them as being part of &quot;the problem&quot; and flock to online communities that &quot;understand them&quot;. These communities become cesspools of reinforcement of their twisted &quot;solutions&quot;, and they lose all connection with the real world.<p>To combat this, we need to get them some connections so they can get over that feeling of isolationism. Unfortunately, it&#x27;s really hard to help someone who doesn&#x27;t want help, so we need to be a bit tactful.<p>This idea isn&#x27;t really fleshed out, but here are some notes:<p>- social app where people can identify individuals they are worried about
- people get connected based on mutual concern, and each can share how closely they are related to the individual

People think they can get away with it.

Cell phones, internet, video games, might not only lower street crime (by changing drug distribution) but also, through social atomization, by giving people alternative social outlets than ones full of people they&#x27;d get into altercations with.<p>So one angle is direct social technology designed to somehow lower the crime rate.  Just spitballing here, how about some improved version of NextDoor?<p>Another angle:  Make it easier to talk to the police.  For example, in Baltimore, a lower proportion of murders are getting solved than a few years ago because people won&#x27;t give police information, and there is now a higher rate of murders, too.  To improve the rate at which people report crimes, make it much easier for people to talk to the police.  Have the social networks expose the local police department as part of the community in some way.  (I don&#x27;t really know how to make this work.)"

2019-08-06,"This looks super cool. I got a bunch of questions!<p>1. Am I correct in understanding this is meant as a client-side only solution for now? Right now we have a pretty complicated translations process that needs to support translations that are spread across the client and server. Would this support a hybrid approach like that?<p>2. Another question I have is where does the `translations.json` file come from and where is that stored? Is that just generated by the CLI and then we have to deal with serving that however we want?<p>3. Is there one `translations.json` file per language? One with all of them? Are there performance concerns with sending large files like that over to the client? This is a general question for me to other developers of large sites: how do you deal with <i>tons</i> of translations?<p>4. Any plans to support existing translations? E.g. if I have an existing set of translations keys and values can I plug those in somewhere? I know y&#x27;all are bootstrapping so it wouldn&#x27;t surprise me if that&#x27;s a Future feature.<p>Again, love the idea of this, and it would be super cool if this solves the problems due to complexity we currently have with supporting a ton of languages.<p>--<p>For some background our current solution involves a generating a rather large (&gt; 1MB) `translations.json` file for each language that we serve to the client via a CDN. Typical map of keys to values.<p>We create the keys ourselves as we go along something like `dashboard.salesCard-helpText`. Then we have to kludgy Drupal instance to populate the key and value, add some tagging to show it needs to be translated. Translations get entered into that Drupal instance. All of this is entered manually. Then that gets used to generate the `translations.json` file I mentioned earlier.<p>We have plans in the future to overhaul the process."

The C++ spec weighs a lot, so I&#x27;m hesitant to call myself an expert, but I have a good working knowledge of the languages. For a previous employer I worked on a commercial Windows IDE for ~3 years.<p>I&#x27;ve been working on the foundations of a 3D game engine for ~3 years, which has taught me a great deal about C, systems and graphics programming on both Win32 and Linux. I chose to build it without libraries (Handmade Hero style) which began as a learning exercise, but ended up teaching me to value simplicity much more than I expected.<p>I can configure and maintain webservers, proxies and load balancers having worked with the web for 10 years.<p>I have a good understanding of the Linux network stack and APIs at the systems level - I&#x27;ve worked on several custom TCP + UDP protocols in the past.<p>I love building tools. Sometimes I feel like I was made to build tools. I build all kinds of tools - tools for computers, tools for automotive maintenance, tools for making tools. I&#x27;ve been building a game engine, which I would consider a collection of tools, for years and I still enjoy working on it.<p>Lastly, and I think this is interrelated with the tools thing, I&#x27;m a systems programmer at heart.

2019-08-06,"I think downvotes are fundamentally broken.<p>If upvotes are agree&#x2F;approval and downvotes are disagree&#x2F;disapproval then why are downvotes used for automatic moderation too? It is a problem in this site and other sites that double-use downvote to mean two different, contradictory, things.<p>The strange thing about HK in particular is that they already offer a &quot;flag&quot; button. If the flag was dedicated to moderation and the downvote dedicated to discussion, the site would be fine, but downvote will auto-hide comments, grey them, shadowban people in certain cases (like green accounts), and is weighed during flagging&#x2F;dead-ing (e.g. one flag for a grey comment Vs. multiple flags for others).<p>I think it has a chilling effect. People are hesitant to post controversial opinions no matter how well written because the consequences (via simple downvotes) can be problematic to even accounts in otherwise good standing.<p>In an ideal world a site should have an upvote&#x2F;downvote and flag button. The first two should be dedicated to discussion only, and having a controversial viewpoint should be noteable but not punishable. The latter (flag) should be for comments thats that violate the site&#x27;s guidelines or community standards (e.g. -isms, trolling, insulting, etc).<p>PS - Part of the problem right now is that for comments the flag button is hidden below the fold. Many new users may never see it."

Let&#x27;s say it takes on average 30 minutes per Github to evaluate - that 500 hours per 1000 candidates, of which that time is coming from people who should be doing Engineering tasks. Even if they can afford it, it will slow down the process too much.<p>And then how to evaluate Githubs? - did they just fork something? Was it their code? Did they get help? Etc.<p>Github is maybe OK for a later stage interview where the investment is worth it to discuss the projects with the candidate in an interview. It could be a nice alternative to a coding test. But you need an interview to get a feeling for if they really wrote the code.<p>My advice - be a good dolphin, and learn to jump through this hoop.<p>It&#x27;s like the driving test where you need to prove you can &quot;reverse around a corner&quot; - something I have never done while actually driving."

2019-08-06,"A few comments which are just my opinions.  First, I&#x27;d argue both languages will solve similar problems fairly equally in terms of outcome &amp; performance. But if you have C++ knowledge on the team already it should be the default unless there is proven reasons to move away.  This isn&#x27;t because I don&#x27;t think teams should learn new things, but when the business is trying to make money or get started that is not the time to risk a project on learning a new language.<p>If you haven&#x27;t already worked in Rust and haven&#x27;t already done POC&#x27;s in Rust now isn&#x27;t the time to risk a project on experimenting.  You could take a small portion of the project and do a test in both languages to see the pros and cons.  I&#x27;d probably not put a ton of weight on the implementation time difference here (unless it is large) because Rust might take you slightly longer just to figure out the differences but that isn&#x27;t a negative and would quickly pass. And when you pick the portion of project do not unfairly bias the test towards either language, that is easy to do to bias the outcome.<p>If this is a vital system where failure has negative consequences for the company I&#x27;d argue again you go with C++ which seems counterintuitive initially but makes sense.  With Rust the team will be learning so the number of mistakes and rework will be higher initially.  The team is already C++ experienced so they understand its worts and issues, and all languages have issues.  So the first result will mean the C++ software will likely be more solid than the Rust version, not because of language capabilities but because of experience in the coders.  If the system isn&#x27;t vital, can accept more risk and is smaller I&#x27;d go with Rust, simply because that is the perfect time to experiment.<p>TL;DR; don&#x27;t bet a non-trivial project the company is needing to help grow or profit on a new language when the team hasn&#x27;t already proven competency on smaller test projects in the language."

I found Sentry[1] to be the most valuable tool for monitoring what&#x27;s going on inside my (Django&#x2F;React) app. Sentry catches every exception&#x2F;error in front- and backend, then collects and aggregates them, so I get a single ticket&#x2F;notification for every type of issue, instead of thousands of those for every instance of the same problem.<p>For me, that&#x27;s much simpler than trying to log each error and analyze the log later on. I still create application logs, but only read them if I need more information about a problem logged by Sentry (most of the time I don&#x27;t need that at all, because Sentry collects a lot of context already).<p>Another plus for Sentry is that it can be self-hosted, which makes GDPR compliance a little bit easier.<p>Besides that, I use Monitor Scout[2] for checking that my app is still up, and fail2ban[3] to get rid of script kiddies trying to brute-force passwords and stuff.<p>[1] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sentry.io&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sentry.io&#x2F;</a>

2019-08-06,"I&#x27;m reminded of a couple of things.<p>&quot;You don&#x27;t hire people and motivate them, you hire motivated people&quot; -- Peter Drucker<p>&quot;You choose to be happy&quot; -- a bunch of old people<p>The first quote applies to extrinsic and intrinsic motivation. And I think it also can relate to optimism and pessimism. If you are looking for extrinsic sources to make you optimistic, then it will be fleeting. Find the optimism and the belief that the future can be better than the now in yourself.<p>The second quote, I don&#x27;t recall where I read it. But the tl;dr was that someone went around and asked a bunch of old folks the secret to being happy. The majority response? You choose it. It explains why you can find happy people in poverty or miserable people bathed in riches. I think the same applies to feeling optimistic: it is a choice.<p>Knowing that I can be happier than I am now (even though I consider myself doing pretty good in that department) gives me reason to be optimistic and to strive for that. There are things I want to see and experience. There is more to life than I have yet to experience. I also know that my world could come crashing down; but I&#x27;ve been low before, and I can do it again, and again, seek being better than I might find myself.<p>All the things that news that you find yourself surrounded by: One, know that it is _designed_ to rope you in and invoke a negative reaction. Two, can you do something about it? If so, and it is meaningful to you, then do your part to improve it. If not, then don&#x27;t. No need to have the world pull you down. Besides, there is always political&#x2F;economic instability, polarization, and extremism. Climate change might doom us all; it might not. World poverty is diminishing and standards of living are leaping higher every generation. I think Stephen Fry did a neat little video a while back (can&#x27;t find it) that showed the different countries of the world and their economic condition over the last couple hundred years: it all got better.<p>There will always be negative things. Sadness, loss, disparity, suffering, and outright evil. People have endured it, survived, and continue to lead happy lives. I think that is amazing, and helps me be optimistic."

2019-08-05,"Why not mark every produced gun with small chips? It need 2 sort of chips. One for private weapons, like many americans have it at home. And the other is for police or people who work for the government. Simcards in mobilephones can be tracked and located, guns should be too. 
Everyone who buys agun,will recive a box wich he has to place infront of his house. If the private weapon leaves the marked area without permission, there will go an loud alarm from this box, also an automated policecall. That the weapon is leaving the registered area without permission. If private person want to take weapon to a shootingranch, they can have a second gun there, or need an timelimited ticket for a route, from home to the shootingranch.  
For citys, areas or bulidings, these Boxes which can register the chips on weapons and play alarmsounds, will directly alarm, if a non allowed weapon is entering an area. There are solarpowered dustbins. Why not install an weaponalarm on it?   If anyone makes a buisness out of this idea, feel free to think on me. Good luck."

These business users just want someone local&#x2F;on-site to help them with basic things like outlook assistance, resolving network (more likely wifi) issues, etc.  At least in the U.S (at least for the numerous firms that I&#x27;ve worked for), the business users are totally fine with just giving &quot;app-building&quot; (and other fun, &quot;advanced&quot; types of work) to vendors&#x2F;suppliers&#x2F;bigtime consultants.   And, then you have the senior leadership on the business side that actually prefers to outsource (get rid of) the local&#x2F;on-site I.T. people...who suffers?  Primarily, the non-senior business users suffer, and then the people who don&#x27;t want to do the &quot;advanced, agile, app-building&quot; work suffer also.<p>I think one way to &quot;look for a job&quot;...is to make one...That is, start your own business...where YOU become the respected, hopefully high-paid vendor&#x2F;supplier&#x2F;bigtime consultant...And then sell your services to non-tech companies, so you handle their traditional I.T. needs.  You will get price pressures to lower your costs, because you&#x27;ll be competing against the TCS, WiPro firms of the world.  But i imagine - at least at some small scale - there must be local markets for small&#x2F;medium businesses that want a local&#x2F;on-site presence of IT support.   This might be worth a shot!  Good luck!"

Your work experience is far more important than your education, so move the education part down so in between &quot;recent work experience&quot; and &quot;volunteer work&quot;.<p>3. &quot;Software Specialist&quot;? Is that your official title? Can you just change the title to something else like &quot;Software and Systems Engineer&quot;? The difference is tiny but could make it a lot easier getting past recruiters and HR.<p>4. Emphasise the programming part of your current role in both your CV and when you talk about it in interviews.<p>Finally, pick what kind of a developer role you want - your CV says you know python, git, sql, linux - so maybe you want to be a backend python &#x2F; django developer?

Apart from Pivotal&#x27;s (the company that&#x27;s the main maintainer of Spring and Spring Boot) own resources, <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.baeldung.com&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.baeldung.com&#x2F;</a> and <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mkyong.com&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mkyong.com&#x2F;</a> are fantastic for learning about Spring and Spring Boot, too.<p>Concepts such as AOP or inversion of control aren&#x27;t exclusive to Spring Boot (or Java, for that matter). It&#x27;s useful to learn about them anyway and yes, if you don&#x27;t know about those subjects before starting with Spring Boot you&#x27;re in for quite a steep learning curve because you&#x27;ll not only have to grasp the ins and outs and implementation details of a new framework but understand entirely new abstract concepts at the same time as well.<p>As for beans specifically, the definition of that term within the larger context of Java has varied a bit over time so there might be at least some ambiguity here, which can lead to understandable confusion. Traditionally, a bean in Java is a class which a.) is serialisable, b.) has a zero-argument constructor and c.) has getters and setters for modifying the internal state of its instances. Due to these properties beans lend themselves to storing and passing application state (for example in the larger context of a dependency injection environment).<p>With Spring and Spring Boot, &#x27;bean&#x27; usually refers to the @Bean annotation that allows to have a method return an instance of a particular class, which will then be made available to other components of the application through Spring&#x27;s dependency injection.<p>The @Bean annotation leaves the object instantiation and wiring to the user (see <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.baeldung.com&#x2F;spring-bean"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.baeldung.com&#x2F;spring-bean</a> ) whereas other Spring annotations such as @Component or @Service (both are so-called stereotypes, with @Component being the more generic one that simply marks a class as &#x27;managed by Spring&#x27; while @Service denotes that the component in question is to be used within the application&#x27;s service layer. See <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.baeldung.com&#x2F;spring-component-repository-service"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.baeldung.com&#x2F;spring-component-repository-service</a>) delegate wiring to Spring dependency injection."

2019-08-04,"well. 10 years is too soon. lets say 20 years. computers have become some kind of wearable. natural language has replaced programming - people dictate their programs to machine learning systems.<p>Almost all jobs that physically allow it have become remote.

2019-08-04,"Generally speaking, my advice is simply don’t use passwords at all. Use other methods that allow you to avoid them.<p>Any password that is chosen and easy enough to remember by a human being is one that is weak enough to be easily cracked, perhaps by well-known methods, or perhaps by more recent ones.<p>Let computers do what they do reasonably well, and don’t try to make humans do that job.<p>Specifically, one key is to use hardware tokens that have been tested and proven to be reasonably robust. You have to tie them into your authentication system, but hopefully that’s not too hard.<p>What about biometrics?<p>Well, don’t use biometrics as a password, because your finger or your eyeball can get taken from you, and you wouldn’t like the after effects. More importantly, if the biometrics for your finger or eyeball become compromised, then how do you change them? All of my fingerprints were compromised in the OPM data breach, because I worked for the DoD, and OPM was where all that information was stored. I’m sure there have been other major breaches of biometric data.<p>Biometrics, if you’re going to use them at all, are best used as the equivalent of a username. They identify who you claim to be, but they explicitly do not authenticate you. You may have my fingerprints, but my username is already pretty well known, and so having my fingerprints would be unlikely to help you there.<p>What else?<p>After all that, if you still have to use passwords, then try to use them as the final layer of security on top of all of the above. Don’t be dependent on them for your only security.<p>And where possible, use a good password manager program to remember and generate all of them for you, so that you minimize the human weakness of that part of the chain."

2019-08-04,"I have sold a couple of companies, not necessarily side projects, but the ideas are the same overall.<p>Easiest transactions are ones where you let a broker handle the details and take their commission, yes it eats some of your gain but it is well worth it to not waste time with people who will happily waste yours.<p>Outside of that, basic rules.  You are selling essentially assets not really a company likely.  So the typical transaction involves an asset purchase agreement with terms and conditions spelled out as to what you are selling, what you are promising, and what the sellers obligations and yours are.  Biggest rule, <i>nothing</i> transfers to buyer until money is paid.  You can use escrow services in two ways, first is they take the full amount of the purchase, once they have the money they tell you and you will transfer the assets to the buyer.  You confirm with the escrow company you have done this and they confirm with the buyer they have received it.  Again this is where it is best to have a defined asset purchase agreement and make it very detailed.   Then one of two things happens, all the money is paid out to you (typical for small transactions) or 80-90% is paid out to you and the remaining % is paid at milestones over some time period, 3, 6, 12 months usually (commonly called a holdback).  The holdback is usually only for larger deals though, &gt; 500k usually.  But I have heard some people wanting a hold back on smaller deals too.<p>Size of deal really matters as to terms.  But you can find common asset purchase agreement terms online, just make sure they are enforceable in your Country&#x2F;State.<p>Biggest pitfall IMO is a contract that isn&#x27;t detailed enough and there is grey area for a seller or buyer to make unsubstantiated claims against the other party to try and gain the upper hand in the transfer of funds or assets.   So always spell out all the details in the agreement.  Even if the agreement is written by non-lawyers that is fine, at least in the US, plain english agreements can be enforced in courts.  Just make them specific enough that it is clear what you are selling and what the buyer is getting and what they are paying for.   I cannot stress this point enough, this is where almost every deal that has trouble starts.<p>If the deal is smaller, try and avoid any holdback and avoid any on-going services beyond getting them up to speed for 30 days or so.  The more complex the asset or the higher the price tag the more you&#x27;ll have to help but that should be built into the price.   Don&#x27;t be afraid of setting fair terms, but don&#x27;t be unreasonable either.  If you aren&#x27;t sure what is unreasonable or fair ask a friend or someone for their opinion who isn&#x27;t in the deal and see if they&#x27;d accept those terms from a stranger, and watch what their initial reaction is to the term.  That&#x27;ll help give you guidance."

2019-08-04,"Project manager can mean different things in different companies. I&#x27;ve seen PM&#x27;s negotiate complex contracts with customers and as a result bring in a lot more revenue for the company without any additional development work. For the regular PM who&#x27;s just managing internally, if they are good the should help reduce the amount of unnecessary work from the business and have developers working on the most crucial work. Being able to negotiate with different &#x27;kinds&#x27; of people is a real skill, and it&#x27;s not just basic office skills.<p>That said I think the &quot;cushy&quot; thing about being a PM though is there isn&#x27;t a new framework to learn next year - you can just keep building on your existing people skills. How to win friends and influence people is more relevant and enduring than any tech skills from the 1930&#x27;s (or even the 1990&#x27;s), for example.<p>But overall IF they are good they are worth it.

Still, it might cause some trouble and costs for yourself (apart from the ethical issues that come with avoiding social security costs in such a manner).<p>The way remote employment (not consulting, which as you&#x27;ve mentioned, involves having multiple clients) could work relatively hassle-free in your case is your US employer setting up a company in Germany (a UG for example, which is a relatively cheap variation of the GmbH) and simply pay you from there, including taxes and social security like any other local employer."

You pay no US tax, and DE tax on 100% of this income. For Sozialversicherung, Rentenversicherung etc it&#x27;s just as if you were selbständig. Since you&#x27;re allowed to give up all sorts of rights in DE conteact Law, the US based contract is probably fine.<p>Contractor for the US company: this is OK too. Since the company does not have a DE presence they can&#x27;t run afoul of the Scheinselbständigkeit rules. You really should register as a Gewerbebetrieb, GmbH or English Limited company though, as that solves a lot of tax questions for you. In any case as a selbständiger in Germany You should expect to get audited in the first few years... And this makes it less likely they&#x27;ll find things you have to pay.<p>I am not a Steuerberater... But I&#x27;ve been in a two selbständig household in Germany for 7 years.

Didn&#x27;t matter that I have a long resume of big organizations, and a letter of reference from the CTO of one of the biggest companies in Germany. I had to form a Gewerbebetrieb and pay back taxes for it. It sucked.<p>Also, good luck on finding a Steuerberater who will help you optimize at all.

2019-08-04,"There are a number of reasons for this:<p>1. America is a paranoid nation. I&#x27;ve lived in many countries, but the 6 years I spent living in Philadelphia, San Francisco, and Oakland, were very eye-opening. Everyone seemed to be afraid of everything. Outside, they were fearful of being mugged or raped or being the victim of some kind of violence. I&#x27;ve never encountered a first world country where people were so afraid of going around in their own cities. Now some of it was justified, of course. There are more dangerous places in America than I&#x27;ve seen in any other first world nation, but not enough to justify the fear. People fear the police. This one I can understand from observing them in action. People also live in fear of financial ruin. One sickness, one job lost at a bad time, one audit and they lose their house and livelihood. There&#x27;s no social safety net to speak of in America, so that does make sense I suppose. Americans freak out when men are around children. I experienced this myself many times while in a park alone, where people would even come up to me and ask me to leave because they had children who couldn&#x27;t play with me &quot;lurking&quot; around. American television was also a very jarring experience. It seemed that their newscasts were to a large part for informing people of the new things they should fear.<p>2. America is a distrustful nation. Civilians don&#x27;t trust police and vice versa. Politicians, scientists, leaders... Nobody trusts anybody. And in a nation where judges are elected, this fosters corruption in the systems that support it.<p>3. America is a divided nation. North vs South is still a very big thing in America. White vs black vs latino is a HUGE thing in America, and the mutual hatred was quite shocking to see. The pure, raw hatred in peoples&#x27; eyes whenever I walked into the &quot;wrong&quot; neighborhood or spoke the &quot;wrong&quot; way is something I&#x27;ll not soon forget.<p>4. America&#x27;s political divisions are becoming worse. They where never very good to begin with, as is evidenced in their effectively two-party system. Politics in America is purely war, and compromise has all but disappeared from their lexicon. Nobody is willing to hear the words of &quot;the enemy&quot; anymore, either in office or out. Speaking to liberals and conservatives in the 2010s was a VERY different experience compared to the 80s.<p>5. America is a vengeful nation. Their tendency to escalate rather than negotiate is especially apparent in their legal, justice, and political systems, and more recently it has become a lot more common in international relations.<p>6. America is a stratified society. Despite the platitudes of the American Dream, I haven&#x27;t seen any first world nation with so much social stratification as I saw in America (and also the UK). To make matters worse, many of the strata fall along racial lines, conflating racism with classism, which makes the problem so much more difficult to solve. The sheer contempt of &quot;lower&quot; classes in the USA by friends and co-workers was shocking, to say the least.<p>7. Bullying is a national sport. I&#x27;ve never seen as much bullying as I observed in America. Their high school groups are very stratified, groups hate other groups, and bullying of people who don&#x27;t conform is rampant. This continues throughout life, and has been fuel for their reality TV shows in recent years (contrast them with the Japanese ones). American culture tends to favor exclusion.<p>8. Inequality is getting much, much worse. The ultra rich are taking so much of the American pie and the poor are getting so desperate that it&#x27;s basically a pot coming to boil. This one thing alone is usually the biggest driver of violence, especially mass violence. This kind of mass violence cannot be prevented when inequality is so high, and it&#x27;s made all the worse by the ready availability of so many deadly weapons. Weapon violence in America is higher than in any other first world nation.<p>Basically, America is a pressure cooker not seen in any other first world nation. Mass violence is a result of that pressure."

Cheat by chucking cloudflare in front of it to get SSL, unless your cloud can do the letsencrypt for you.<p>Avoid Kubernetes, docker, nosql, lambdas and anything else that’ll complicate things.<p>You want a monolithic crud app that serves up HTML like it’s 2006."

2019-08-03,"(1) The political attack:  Google is increasingly coming under fire for being a monopolist.  Such attacks could lead to the demise of or restrictions being put on AMP.<p>(2) The technical attack:  kill the web as we know it.  The idea here is that the web is hopelessly corrupted by the entanglement of text with code (e.g. Javascript,)  the advertising-based business model,  pop-ups,  etc.  A particular sign of this is &quot;scanning&quot; behavior where you go to Google News or Hacker News or your round of daily blogs and hit &quot;reload&quot; to see what is new.  This has multiple insidious effects on the human nervous system,  one is that some of your attention is used to suppress content that you&#x27;ve seen before,  which lowers your working IQ.<p>It may sound like science fiction,  but I think we need to replace the web browser with an intelligent agent which can &quot;scan&quot; content for us and only show us what is new,  interesting,  non-toxic,  etc."

1.) find a niche that you find interesting before you source
2.) you bulk buy this product and ship it directly to Amazon warehouse
3.) make attractive Amazon listing and put much effort into your launch so that you can get your product ranked
4.) with a successful launch and a quality product you can get to the first page of Amazon
5.) just sit back and refill orders<p>It has some cons as well, but it is definitely viable way how to create passive income. The cons are following:
- the fees for Amazon FBA including monthly seller fee, shipping to warehouse, warehouse storage each month, long term warehouse storage, shipping to customer, Amazon referral fee
- you are dependent on one platform
- you are not building your own brand (but you can start it afterwards if you see FBA is working for you)"

2019-08-03,"Senior engineer speaking. 20 years of experience in the software industry.<p>Management is knowing of to make people work together toward a common goal.<p>1. A managerial role is not _easy_ to hire for if you&#x27;re looking for someone who has (for a start) correct skills &amp; experience to manage a team (of engineers only, or of various backgrounds).<p>One of their roles is to help his team focus on what they want to&#x2F;can do for everyone to succeed. That implies a lot of ingesting, structuring information and communicate it in all directions, all of the time.
You need practice, and skills, to handle that without becoming completely numb.<p>2. Technical skills aren&#x27;t everything. Far from that. When hiring, it&#x27;s among the last items on my checklist. You want people to be motivated for the job, to be capable and willing to work in a team, to be willing to learn and spread what they learnt. What they know and can bring in total derives from that.<p>3. You get 1 manager for several members of a team. And a manager also coordinates with other managers &amp; team members. 
Budget-wise, you can take and compare the manager compensation with any one team member&#x27;s compensation but that does not make much sense.<p>4. Companies success being the result of (mostly) the technical excellence of their teams is the worst toxic professional myth I&#x27;ve encountered; it took me 5 years to see it and 10 more to accept it.<p>Purpose&#x2F;strategy (know what you want) + design (know how to get there) + logistics (know who&#x2F;what to ask for it) trumps most of the rest.<p>The bonus is if you also have the technical skills to do it but that&#x27;s not a requirement.<p>Being an engineer is great, I love it.

2019-08-03,Is there a standard for decentralized web?
2019-08-03,"The reason why we have AMP in the first place is that normal news websites are unusable. The extra caching&#x2F;preloading it enables is a bonus, but the main benefit comes from AMP websites not being as shitty as regular sits.<p>It&#x27;s pretty easy to make usable web sites with regular HTML, and it&#x27;s almost certainly possible to make just as shitty AMP sites. However, AMP solved the political&#x2F;bureaucratic problem by providing a strong carrot to make a non-shitty version of the web site, and made it easier to make a non-shitty one than a shitty one.<p>The publishers already have to spend time remaking their web site, and the goal they get provided with is &quot;keep it simple and lightweight&quot;, and doing shitty things is made hard&#x2F;expensive. So they grumble and do it, getting it mostly right. (Although they seem to have realized the &quot;potential&quot; and started shittifying the AMP pages too).<p>They could have a normal experience that is very similar. Yet, they still serve the non-AMP, ad- and tracker-laden main page that takes 20x as long to load, jumps around while doing so, and tries to blast you with an autoplaying video that remains stuck to your screen while you scroll.<p>I don&#x27;t get the hate for AMP - it somehow succeeded in the impossible quest to get publishers to make less shitty web sites, and it does improve user experience by preloading the pages.<p>It&#x27;s just like with the &quot;acceptable ads&quot; program - some web sites participating in it serve significantly less shitty ads to people who only allow &quot;acceptable ads&quot;, while serving a worse version _of the same ad_ to everyone else.<p>So maybe, to answer your question: Build a standard (or extend the AMP standard) that works just like this, but is enforced by the browser. Much harder to do and unlikely to get enough momentum&#x2F;incentive to actually succeed, though."

Just like ad blockers were a response to websites not respecting people&#x27;s attention and safety, likewise AMP is a response to them not respecting people&#x27;s time."

I do hold a small amount of hope that Nintendo will have realised the demand for Wario Land 6 by then, and that some sort of proper Paper Mario revival might be on the cards, but I&#x27;ve hoped for that for a while now. Lootboxes may be classified as gambling by then too.<p>Not going to predict anything web development or tech related, since those fields change a lot, and well, who knows what things will look like after 6000 different JavaScript frameworks have come and gone. All we can know there is that HTML, CSS and JavaScript will probably be used for websites and apps in some form or another.<p>Finally on a political note... well a schism may be on the horizon in some societies. At least, the US seems to be more and more divided between the &#x27;left&#x27; and &#x27;right&#x27;, and the cultural values underpinning both sides seem to completely unreconcilable at this point in time. So I can see tensions building, politics becoming more divided and fraught and things getting worse until eventually, one side tries to change the law (or constitution) in a way that breaks the camel&#x27;s back and things just collapse.<p>I also see at least one &#x27;first world&#x27; country ending up as a dictatorship, if only because the rise of populism and authoritarianism seems to be an issue just about everywhere right now.<p>But those are just a few minor predictions right now."

Mostly, it sounds more like a statistician who codes, than a researcher who focuses on data-as-source.<p>Anyhow, the first module is complete, and I still have the rest of the 20-module course outline - which was aimed at public health professionals - and was thinking of crowd-funding each module, if anyone is interested? It&#x27;s based on the Sloyd model of teaching, so each module is discrete, building on the previous module, and provides a functional and holistic understanding of the scientific method as it applies to data."
2019-08-03,Started using Prolific a few days. Love the fact that it has a clean and simple interface and it pays in British Pounds which then translate to higher CAD&#x2F;USD amount. The only thing is that there are not enough survey and the site does sign me out sometime after showing a 500 error. Would also love to know if you guys plan to have a mobile app&#x2F;mobile friendly site at some point. Started using Qmee app on my phone and love it&#x27;s interface and level of engagement so far. I understand that Prolific and Qmee might be serving different markets but would be nice to see Prolific implement some of it. Would love to give additional feedback if you&#x27;d like.

I do most of my coding in Sublime over ssh i.e. my test sites live in containers on a little core2duo desktop. Each container has it’s own Sublime. I can spin up any sublime, from any project, from any machine on my lan. As it’s internal go for a weak but performant ssh cipher or you will get too much latency. Copies of the same containers are used in the live environment. I have a container running Gitlab for versioning.<p>The core2duo box cost £25 and I love it. It’s also a file&#x2F;plex server.

2019-08-03,"If you make many web pages that do not require JavaScript, CSS, and many images or videos, then that also improves the speed, and is better for accessibility.<p>For other cases you do need some scripts and stuff, I have suggested a &quot;widget&quot; attribute nd &lt;widget&gt; element. Both &lt;script&gt; and &lt;widget&gt; elements support the widget attribute. If recognized by the browser and enabled by the user, then the element and its contents are replaced by something implementation-dependent (and not necessarily representable in normal HTML). Otherwise, a &lt;widget&gt; element acts like &lt;span&gt;. This also improves speed, as it can skip loading a script if it has its own version, and possibly also use a native code version specific to the browser or an extension. It also allows better user customization, for example if a special text editing widget is used on the web page (rather than a normal &lt;textbox&gt;), then it can be replaced with one that has vi or emacs key bindings, or to implement it without animations if the user wants to implement that script without animations.<p>The other alternative, for stuff that doesn&#x27;t need HTML and HTTP, is to use Gopher. Then, no need to consider what kind of user interface is used and any other kind of accessibility; it already is!"

2019-08-03,"You&#x27;re asking the wrong question. AMP isn&#x27;t bad, Google ranking AMP pages over equally-fast non-AMP pages is bad. But Google&#x27;s main goal here is to preload&#x2F;render content without the content knowing it is being preloaded, so that the page appears to load instantly when the user clicks on it.<p>What I think actually needs to happen is a standard for deferred navigation where the UA can be told to load a bunch of resources and then choose one of them to actually navigate to (basically what AMP does). The problem here is that Google is (as we type here) actively coming up with horrible standards like signed exchanges so that they never have to send users away from their own domain, so I don&#x27;t think they would be fans of a standardized system that killed AMP."

2019-08-03,"The whole marketing aspect behind AMP is that its fast. This is the narrative that has sucked most publishers in.

It relies on WebPageTest.org and tests about 60+ articles pages nightly on 3G and &#x27;Fast 3G&#x27; speeds. The myth that you cannot have a fast web page AND have ads on it is a myth. Several organizations do it and do it well (DotDash dominates the board with their sites).<p><a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;webperf.xyz&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;webperf.xyz&#x2F;</a><p>Before I hit API limits on WPT I was also testing against the AMP version of the page too. The speed differences between the regular page load and the AMP page load was often very similar. I recall in some cases (Quartz, Guardian, NYT) that regular pages loaded faster than AMP.<p>That aside, assuming a regular web page took 10 seconds to load (a top 10 article) you would expect that the AMP page would be faster, say down to 2 or 3 seconds in Load Time in order to make the effort of having yet another template&#x2F;format to support and to justify the effort to re-implement analytics, pay-wall, and ads?<p>Very often it was the a saving of only a second or two. It all adds up, but as someone who works with resource strapped publishes thats not worth the resources. Thats especially true when I could have spent all that time optimizing our regular pages instead of this other project.<p>Why do people think AMP is faster? Pre-caching by Google.<p>The thing is Google (IMHO) could pre-cache regular web pages too. They don&#x27;t.

2019-08-02,"I&#x27;m locked in to my current vendor, but I just wanted to share some of my thoughts about some pain points I saw in your sales pitch.<p>My experience is that most academics pay less than $6.50 per hour for an initial point of contact. For instance, I am currently fielding a survey (N &gt; 5,000 per week, cross-sectional rather than panel) and we pay about $2 all-in, including the provider&#x27;s charge, for a survey that&#x27;s about 20 minutes. We&#x27;d fall afoul of your compensation rate pretty substantially. If we wanted to do some panel work and we needed re-contact, we&#x27;d definitely ramp up our payment quickly to help avoid attrition, but for the first contact, no.<p>If we wanted to be paying out your rate, we would almost certainly have to get an additional sponsor partner to piggyback some consumer research on top of our actual treatment. We don&#x27;t want to do this, it&#x27;s hard enough dealing with our primary funders. This makes me believe you are mostly targeting commercial &#x2F; market behavior researchers. That&#x27;s fine, but the pitch suggests you want academics. For transparency&#x27;s sake, what is your balance of private and university clients as of today?<p>Second, even working with large sample providers, their pools are often fairly small. We requested 5,000 unique respondents a week for a year and found our sample provider could only guarantee a 1-2 month lockout. Obviously the effective pool you need to guarantee 5,000 * 52 is enormous and so we were expecting to have to negotiate on lockout, but all of this dances around the fact that sample providers are not transparent about the size of their pool and researchers like us are constantly worried about fraud both by sample providers and by respondents. How large is your pool?<p>Finally, this kind of quota sampling relies on our ability to weight the sample to the population. Weighting is totally permissible, but responsible weighting is going to cap the weight at the high end -- no one wants the one black Republican to skew the entire poll because they have a 150 weight on their observation (this isn&#x27;t me getting needlessly political, this happened with the USC tracking poll last election cycle). In my experience, the hardest thing about quota sampling as opposed to the old RDD phone samples 20 years ago is that it&#x27;s very difficult to get high education &#x2F; high SES &#x2F; high income respondents. High income respondents should be 10% of the population and they simply are nowhere near 10% of the pools that you get from standard recruitment methods. Can you speak a bit about a) how you recruit high income people into your pool; and b) what percentage of your pool would be high income (say HHI &gt; $125k a year or so).<p>Finally, what is your pool attrition rate? If someone takes their first Prolific survey today, what is the probability they will still be taking a survey a year from now? It&#x27;s nice that you have re-contact as part of your system, but the problem in my experience is not figuring out how to recontact, it&#x27;s getting people to stay engaged for a long time.<p>Hope you have good answers to these questions, and that if you do, answering them here will help you get positive exposure from other readers."

Our only goal in posting it was to attract the sort of folks who might enjoy working within that culture.<p>It&#x27;s worth noting that there&#x27;s a lot of cultural diversity <i>between</i> companies in the tech industry these days, and there are some in which &quot;10x engineers&quot; might thrive.

We just wanted to find a way to catch the attention of people who might be a good fit for us.<p>I think a big part of building a company is deciding what you do (and don&#x27;t) stand for.

2019-08-02,"This is definitely a space that needs innovation! How do you plan to handle the case of survey takers being real people but just skimming through the survey?<p>In my experience running research studies, this was the main problem with MTurk. Things like bots and blatantly junk answers were relatively rare and easy enough to detect and filter. What was much harder to deal with was the fairly high volume of users who just want to finish the survey as fast as possible. It&#x27;s not so bad for short surveys, but anything over 5 minutes starts to have issues with low quality responses.<p>We had to introduce several control questions to check for consistency in answers and measure time to find outliers. But, it was not an ideal setup and there were still many survey takers we suspected were not paying much attention. The breakdown for our studies was something like 60% good quality answers, 35% low quality answers that are hard to distinguish from high quality, and 5% total junk answers. We ended up doing an in-person study where we got much cleaner results, presumably because people pay better attention when they feel someone is watching them.<p>Wages don&#x27;t seem to do much for this.

2019-08-02,"I think it needs to be taken in the context of the twitter backlash against the 10x engineer tweet. The tweet was largely interpreted as &quot;10x engineers are brilliant jerks&quot;. 
People have been writing about toxic environments created by brilliant jerks for years and I think Human Interest is just trying to avoid creating an environment like that.<p>If that&#x27;s not how you want to work, that&#x27;s alright, but casting is as discrimination feels like a stretch."
2019-08-02,"I agree about &#x27;nag &#x27; alerts which trigger every time being quite useless - if a parent is so phased out they forget their child they&#x27;re probably going to tune out routine alerts as well. And yes motion sensors would be costly. 
So let&#x27;s go even more basic. Seems like these accidents happen predominantly in rear facing car seats. So just a light at the back of the car seat which turns on when the seat belt is fastened would indicate there&#x27;s a baby in it. Kinda like an &quot;occupied&quot; sign on airline restrooms. If the baby&#x27;s seat belt is fastened it&#x27;s a sure indicator there&#x27;s a baby in it ( I mean who re-fastens the belt after taking their kid out lol) and the light would be visible to the driver through the rear view mirror or when they get out. 
Can&#x27;t say much about manufacturers trying to escape liability but you&#x27;re probably right about that.
Apparently there is a bill being presented for a law to make all car manufacturers install alerts to check back seats but again, routine alerts are easily ignorable"

2019-08-02,"I see the ultimate solution to be a way of making cars not be hot when parked.  I live in Florida, and the first 10 minutes of every car ride is the AC trying to get rid of the residual heat from being parked.  I would happily spend $5000 more on a car that was not a hot-box when parked.  There is no law of physics that says that the car interior must be sealed when the occupant leaves the car.<p>There are third-party solutions like <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.walmart.com&#x2F;ip&#x2F;Solar-Powered-Car-Vent-Window-Fan-for-Car-Auto-Vehicle&#x2F;613091786"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.walmart.com&#x2F;ip&#x2F;Solar-Powered-Car-Vent-Window-Fan...</a> , but this is just a workaround for the fact that the typical car is not properly vented for a warm climate while parked.  I understand that there are theft concerns with more venting, and that for cars in cold climates you would rather the car hold its heat while parked.  Nevertheless, I think that car companies could solve this problem easily by having extra vents which would open when the car was put in park to keep the car interior at around the same temperature as the outside air."

Namebase is a domain registrar and onramp for the Handshake blockchain.<p>Handshake is an experimental peer-to-peer root DNS. It&#x27;s a protocol that&#x27;s similar to Bitcoin, except that instead of using the coins for money, you use Handshake coins to register names on the Handshake blockchain. Handshake names are top-level domain names (.com, .io,. org, etc), and they&#x27;re different from normal domain names because they&#x27;re unstoppable; no one can censor, tamper with, or seize your name from you. Furthermore, Handshake names are associated with public keys, which enables SSL without relying on Certificate Authorities (a failure point in the security of DNS today).<p>Namebase is a domain registrar and exchange for Handshake (we&#x27;re a separate company from the Handshake Foundation). You can register and manage Handshake names on our website, and if you don&#x27;t have any coins, you can buy some using dollars or bitcoin on our exchange.<p>We&#x27;re looking for a generalist marketer to run content marketing, community events, influencer marketing, SEO, and various growth experiments. If you have experience in developer relations that&#x27;s a big plus!<p>Our mission at Namebase is to give an unstoppable name to everyone on the internet. Handshake makes it possible to have DNS that can&#x27;t be shut down — even the Great Firewall of China can&#x27;t censor Handshake names. We have the opportunity to change how the internet works, and our team is small enough that you&#x27;ll have immense impact on our software development and company direction. Importantly, we don&#x27;t have to do this alone. Our community is incredibly engaged and willing to help out, much more so than a traditional startup because we&#x27;re working on a movement rather than a product. Message tieshun @ our domain if you&#x27;re interested in leading this movement to build an unstoppable internet!"

2019-08-02,"Honestly I&#x27;ve never found a programming language where SQL didn&#x27;t have some tedious tasks.  There are always lots of little edge cases and error handling etc that never seems to be fully covered by the libraries.  That said, for a CRUD type app, I usually default to node.js unless the requirements would exclude it for some reason, then I&#x27;d move to Go, but generally I avoid writing new Java anymore, not that I think Java is bad or evil, I just prefer other languages.<p>For node we use the pg-format package to format most of our queries and then the standard pg package to execute queries.  It is honestly one of the easier and cleaner ways methods I&#x27;ve used.  I am not a big fan of ORM&#x27;s and find a lot of them add way to much complexity for too little benefit, so I am a big fan of either stored procedures&#x2F;functions or straight (but safe) query building.<p>I have written code in node.js, Go, C &amp; C++, Java and Python to manipulate data in different sql databases and they all have some form of tedious tasks in relation to the SQL integration."

2019-08-02,"We just had something similar earlier this year on one of our systems where it sends alerts to clients, but it failed to send them (in our case though the log showed they sent).<p>The solution for us took on three unique steps:<p>1. Make sure unit tests exist for all permutations of failure (network, bad keys etc) and are mandatory to validate that all alerts are operational when new code is being created.  Add a commit hook if needed.<p>2. We created a specific new internal demo account where upon new code being deployed we run a partially automated process (someone needs to push a button right now) where data that triggers specific different types of alerts is inserted into our system to force an alert to be sent out (this is done in production).  We did this because we found that unit testing covered one scenario, but a number of other scenarios exist which can be unique to production, e.g. network access, permissions, different keys etc.<p>3. Add daily checks (or more&#x2F;less often depending on the need) that all third parties (even internal) your code depends on for alerts are up and operational.  We have one where we do hourly checks on the system now to insure it has not failed, another one is only done weekly because the risk of not getting the alert is super low and not client facing.  We found in some cases we have one vendor who was sending success even though the alert was never delivered (it basically ate our request), which was found through these automated checks because say 95% went fine but we would miss an hour here or there -- that allowed us to go back through the logs and get with the vendor to see wtf.<p>All of this seems pretty straight forward and obvious honestly, and we had most of it in place but found it just wasn&#x27;t robust enough in some cases and we weren&#x27;t doing #2 &amp; #3 with enough granularity."

Exceptions to this would be cases where we are relying on non-Python based platforms, such as Elasticsearch.<p>* Frontend components are almost exclusively built as React webapps.<p>Before shifting work to Gitlab, we experimented with using AWS Codestar (which has fully managed build service, automated continuous delivery and deployments, etc...). It was extremely useful to be able to commit code and have that automatically kickoff a deployment so we could examine the changes from within the context of the application.<p>For the scope of this project, I would like your help with the following:<p>- Installation and configuration of Gitlab Enterprise on AWS, Including any integration required to enable automated deployments. This would include configuration of the AWS kubernetes service, etc...<p>- Guidance on how to best handle projects with heavy AWS dependencies - for example, would deploying a review app standup an entirely separate environment via CloudFormation? Or would we have dev&#x2F;test&#x2F;prod AWS assets setup ahead of time that the review apps would depend on (for example, if we were building an app atop the AWS Elasticsearch service).<p>- Guidance on how we can build application templates that may facilitate the process of beginning work on a new project. For example, CodeStar had several project templates to choose from (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.aws.amazon.com&#x2F;codestar&#x2F;latest&#x2F;userguide&#x2F;templates.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.aws.amazon.com&#x2F;codestar&#x2F;latest&#x2F;userguide&#x2F;templa...</a>).<p>- Any other expertise you can provide to help our team move through projects in a more efficient manner (across project management, development, testing, deployment, etc...).<p>Contact information:<p>email: tom@thegrif.net

  2) Can the user tailor which app names are shared vs. those they prefer to keep private?
  3) Did earlier prototypes try a generic approach for ID, e.g. capturing hWND of the focused window and querying
     it&#x27;s class, title, executable name, etc?  Do Mac&#x2F;Linux have analogous facilities for window identification?
  4) Was it a challenge to distinguish browser-based apps? (e.g. Chrome, vs. Docs)
  5) Is there any attempt to consolidate contexts that involve switching between multiple apps? (e.g. while I&#x27;m
     coding VS Code, I jump to a browser to search docs for an API).
  6) Is there some lag&#x2F;hysteresis, so if you switch briefly to a different app and back, it doesn&#x27;t generate noise?

I was sad to see they weren&#x27;t able to make it.<p>One interesting feature they had was low-fi video (grainy black and white, very low framerate), with the same basic idea as knowing what app you are in: a chance to see whether you were at the computer, and maybe a little hint at your mental state, but maybe not too intrusive. But I don&#x27;t know how it acted in practice. They had complete drop-in, but I like your one-sided-talk-first.<p>Another interesting feature might be something like a I&#x27;d-like-to-know-when-you-see-this-page.

Personal note:<p>I as a software developer myself was initially rather critical about taking a position at a gaming company due to stories of crunch time and low pay, but my experience has been very positive in both regards at InnoGames: Crunch time does not really apply to a mobile gaming company (very few hard deadlines), and especially not to our team, as it is not a game team; and I was offered a better compensation package than what I had initially asked for. The workflow and processes in the team are driven by ourselves, and the two worlds of the job between creating and maintaining software on one side and providing support to game teams on the other are challenging in a very positive way and provide a lot of variety.<p>We have several open tech positions but this one is directly in my team so feel free to shoot me any questions about the position at dennis dot neufeld at innogames dot com<p>Link: <a href=""http:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.jobvite.com&#x2F;m?3LZ4zkwc"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.jobvite.com&#x2F;m?3LZ4zkwc</a><p>Other open positions: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.innogames.com&#x2F;career&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.innogames.com&#x2F;career&#x2F;</a>"

You try to rank your content for certain keywords in search results<p>- Real estate. I&#x27;ve been a real estate investor since 2008 and I can say that it&#x27;s probably the most well known way of building passive income. Simply put, you buy a house, rent it out and continue the process. However, it&#x27;s a long term game because of the amount of starting capital required to buy. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it if you don&#x27;t have much money to start because of the repairs and maintenance you will be responsible for as tenants continue renting.<p>I hope this helped.

In short, we’re the fastest way for organizations to learn more about their future customers.<p>We’re looking for engineers who are curious about product development and consumer behavior, want to work on related challenges, and value opportunities to explore new technologies that execute against a robust, collaborative product vision. We use Ruby, NodeJS, VueJS, Postgres, Mongo, Redis and many other technologies, but we don&#x27;t think it matters if you&#x27;ve used similar technologies on a different stack. Our engineering teams tackle a diverse and evolving array of challenges; from architecting and scaling our microservices to handling real- time video and using machine learning and natural language processing to empower real world business solutions. This position is full-time and on-site at our NYC (SoHo) office or full-time and remote (within the US), though remote engineers may be asked to visit NYC occasionally.<p>Full Stack Engineer: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.workable.com&#x2F;j&#x2F;7A871F883C"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.workable.com&#x2F;j&#x2F;7A871F883C</a>

2019-08-01,"I recently read Carl Newport&#x27;s &quot;deep work&quot;. One of the points he made that struck home the most was that a leading indicator of success for most knowledge workers was the number of hours spent doing deep work. Ie - the number of hours spent doing uninterrupted work that makes use of your differentiated skills.<p>As a remote worker the thing I  treasure most is the opportunity to organise my schedule to spend the majority of my time doing deep work. Frequently communicating and getting feedback on my work asychronously rather than constantly being interrupted and dragged into synchronous interactions as in an open plan office.<p>The thought of allowing anyone to contact me at any time, at the push of a button feels like a huge step back.<p>There are lots of challenges around communication in a remote company, however I don&#x27;t think the solution is recreating an open office online."

All those things will still work in 10-15 years time.

Magic is a simple idea with endless potential - one phone number that you can send a text message to 24&#x2F;7 and get anything you want, whenever you want it. Food, flowers, plane tickets, reservations, electronics, you name it. We fulfill these requests magically for our users by being a common interface to a growing network of national and international service providers. Most of our users use us on a regular basis to make their lives easier and to be more productive, but of course, we fulfill our share of crazy requests: meeting celebrities, skywriting, 1,000 gallons of seawater, helicopters, motorcycles...<p>But all of this is just the beginning. Magic is a command line interface to the world; it is an API for everything. You can’t &quot;sudo cancel my Comcast subscription&quot; but you can &quot;magic cancel my Comcast subscription.&quot; It’s a unified plaintext interface that sits as a layer of abstraction over the set of all possible products, services, and actions. It’s the Star Trek computer. It’s your companion and your friend.<p>Magic was founded in 2015 by a team of software engineers with one simple premise: create a natural language interface to the complexity of the world, delivered by a combination of artificial intelligence and human expertise. We are hardcore developers at heart, we are highly iterative, and we are relentless. We are minimal and focused on writing code that really matters.<p>ABOUT THE POSITION:<p>Our primary technologies right now are Node.js, Meteor, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, AWS, Docker, Ansible. Experience with these are very nice but not required. We believe in using the right tool for the job.<p>We are currently hiring for experienced senior and mid-level engineering positions. This is a full-stack, generalist role for which you will be given a high degree of autonomy and will be expected to deploy impactful code to production in your first week. We&#x27;re less concerned with your resume and more concerned with your ability to get real stuff done.<p>ABOUT WORKING REMOTE:<p>This position is full remote and you can live wherever you want, or travel while you work with us. As our team is distributed across several time zones, compatibility with both UTC-7&#x2F;8 and UTC+8 is helpful and willingness to participate in team meetings at non-standard times for 5-10 hours per week is ideal.<p>Come build the future of human-computer interaction with us.<p>Bonus points if you&#x27;ve got...<p>- Experience working with Node.js, Meteor, modern web application frameworks
- Experience with devops, the AWS suite, Docker, Ansible, Jenkins

We&#x27;re ok if it takes a little longer to get things right because we believe it leads to better products, better software, and happier engineers in the long term. There&#x27;s obviously a tradeoff between speed and quality, and while we&#x27;re always trying to find the sweet spot, we tend to err on the side of shipping well designed software.<p>Related to this, engineers are expected to give input on the product. It&#x27;s not &quot;here&#x27;s a spec, go build exactly what it says.&quot; We think building great products is a &quot;contact sport,&quot; meaning there&#x27;s typically a lot of (respectful!) debate and refinement over the things we build before they reach their final form. This means pointing out the UI inconsistencies and UX awkwardness when starting to build out the frontend or coming up with novel ways to leverage the immense dataset we have on the backend to drive better outcomes for our customers.<p>We also do a lot of team activities here.

See it as a 1 hour vacation into alice in wonderland. I don&#x27;t see myself ever using lisp, but after using an imperative language for a long time and having it become second nature, I found it quite a fun mental leap to learn functional programming. Well lisp is basically a similar mental stretch... you can get a taste of it in only 10 bullet points (in the link). it will take you only 1-2 hours. I found it wildly refreshing, enlightening... any time you see paradigms youre used to for 10+ years done a different way there are so many &quot;ah-ha&quot; moments its like firecrackers going off.<p>The part that is very cool, is that in lisp there are no statements, only expressions. So the &#x27;physical limitiation&#x27; of writing code almost feels like theres no rules, such that it just flows effortlessly. Like in English, you can&#x27;t end a sentence with a preposition (like a statement, you cant put an if statement in the middle of the expression 1 + 1). But in lisp, there are no rules like that.<p>It&#x27;s super fun to bend your mind in new ways even if you dont use it. I highly recommend it, it was really a fun day doing that tutorial."

2019-08-01,"What would the tech solution look like?<p>A lot of the &quot;solutions&quot; today are nothing more than generic nags when you shut off the car based on nothing more than any weight on the rear seats, which people quickly learn to filter out (since an empty car seat triggers them every time).<p>Motion sensors and infrared based sensors aren&#x27;t reliable for babies in particular (due to lack of motion during sleep, or hats&#x2F;thicker cloths&#x2F;blankers).<p>The only tech solutions that may work today are:<p>- Cameras above the seats and image recognition, but this is expensive to get right. It could be used for other things which is a perk (like security, or &quot;child mirror&quot; usage).<p>- Integration into the car seats themselves (e.g. when the harness is clipped, it completes a circuit).  But how does the car seat communicate with the vehicle itself?<p>Plus liability has to be considered. If the vehicle manufacturers (or car seat manufacturers) do nothing at all they aren&#x27;t liable. But ironically if they try to make this problem less prevalent but fall short, they can be suited for that failure (and or be forced to generate expensive recalls).<p>I apologise for bringing up politics: But this is an area where government could help. If car&#x2F;carseat manufacturers had liability immunity and or a government body that spends money developing the tech&#x27; I could definitely see it take off.<p>I&#x27;d personally like to see a 3.5mm jack receptacle inside the latch-anchor opening. A carseat plugs in. It completes a simple electrical circuit. The car&#x27;s infotainment unit now &quot;knows&quot; a child is onboard.<p>But that&#x27;s just one idea. Maybe there&#x27;s others. I think liability, cost, and practicality are real problems though. The technological solutions need some real thought. I just like the above because K.I.S.S."
