"super project ! i ve  pretty baffled with the difficulty to save a webpage in proper format. I’ve tried with PDF converter, getPolaroid app and of course firefox screen shot feature for the entire scroll thing.
Will try this for saving purposes.<p>I am also interested in cloning&#x2F;forking sites for modification purposes, I will feedback you on the results four my consulting gigs"
"BTW, for digital cartography, I highly recommend The Guide to Map Design by Amy Lee (Mapbox): <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mapbox.com&#x2F;map-design&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mapbox.com&#x2F;map-design&#x2F;</a>"
This is one of those &quot;exciting mix of tech terms&quot; submissions. Really well done!
"I always wonder what is keeping the world away from WW3. I guess that nuclear weapons make it too frightening to start any large conflict if it can involve mushroom clouds.<p>I don&#x27;t think leaders would really retaliate a nuclear attack, since it always is preferable to de-escalate a nuclear conflict than to escalate it. Mutual assured destruction is something nobody is interested in."
"&gt;So what do we achieve by building new highways and speeding up travel? We don&#x27;t actually shorten people&#x27;s trips; we just enable them to live and work farther away from each other.<p>That is a good thing. One of the reasons why the Bay Area is so expensive is that the commute to cheaper areas in Central Valley is so long. Mobility allows choices. The type of home and the neighborhood you want to live in, is no longer as tightly coupled to the type of job you want to do, the place of worship you want to attend, the school you want your kids to go to, or the doctor your family wants to see.<p>Yeah, having a corner grocery might be good, but without mobility, the grocers are going to realize that you don&#x27;t really have much choice about buying from them, and maybe start charging higher prices, or not stocking as much variety, or higher fewer people and having less service.<p>Mobility means more choice, and more decoupling. This means you not having to live in a high priced, crappy home because of proximity to your job. The further the distance we can make 30 minutes of commute, the more choices people have."
"This appears to confuse the representation of a number, with the quantity it represents."
What part of the employment agreement guarantees you “meaningfulness”? I know the parts that guarantee my pay &amp; benefits.
"He mentioned that Cambridge switched to four digit phone numbers in 1939. Where can one find out such things like that, where did they record and document it as a fact? I wonder if they still had manual operators or was that automatic switching?<p>the link: [1] the first automatic switch was introduced in 1922; so they had the fascinating problem of interoperation between manual switched regions and automatic ones. So that Oxford might have had it either way.<p>[1] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.btplc.com&#x2F;Thegroup&#x2F;BTsHistory&#x2F;1912to1968&#x2F;1922.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.btplc.com&#x2F;Thegroup&#x2F;BTsHistory&#x2F;1912to1968&#x2F;1922.ht...</a>"
"Gosh, what a click-bait title. I guess this is a politically biased article, trying to attack  Trump. It&#x27;s not that I like the tariff nor the fight b&#x2F;w the countries, but it&#x27;s just that the title is straight wrong.<p>&quot;China Exodus&quot; has been a thing for almost a decade, meaning that there has been good reasons to leave China other than that little tariff thingy. Rising labour costs, ever-increasing regulations, unexplained government actions, a large number of Chinese (copycat) competitors, government-backed industrial espionage, corruption, lack of justice, etc. It has been like this since mid 2000s, and many global corporations have either already moved their critical production lines or set up backups outside of China.<p>Quitting is impossible? Nope. Totally possible and many have already done that since years ago. The actual problem is small businesses who can&#x27;t afford to build new suitable production lines in a hurry. China is indeed the best factory right now, since it&#x27;s almost a grab-and-go. But that doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s going to be the best for everyone nor forever."
"The problem of many web-based businesses is, they can&#x27;t decide (or don&#x27;t want to) if they are more like the phone company, or more like a bricks-and-mortar business.  If they are like the phone company, they are not responsible for guaranteeing that what you buy over the phone is legit, but they also don&#x27;t get a cut.  If they are like a bricks-and-mortar business, they do take a cut, but they get liability.  It is similar to Facebook, Twitter etc. trying to sometimes act like a phone company and sometimes like a conference hall.<p>The reason is clear: they want to be compensated like a retailer or conference hall, but have the (relative lack of) liability of the phone company or the postal service, who don&#x27;t make any claims that communications via their services are going to be honest, just that they allowed the two parties to communicate.<p>Gradually, they are all going to be forced by society (not only government) into one role or the other, but I am not surprised they are trying to put that off as long as possible."
Mathematical physics and engineering holds up to empirical scrutiny.
"If you are lost high in the zone, water is precious. So, lost people would tend to congregate near water, thats a basic survival outcome. The commonality of head wound, across a long time window argues for something which is more likely to persist over long times.<p>So, I go with <i>yeti favoured a head-shot, and only predated on lonely travellers high near the lake</i> as the least-likely outcome.<p>Every archeology program made by the BBC says &quot;ritual&quot; so there&#x27;s that. Maybe blunt force trauma from a long tibetan horn? Or blunt force trauma for <i>playing</i> the long tibetan horn?"
"This subject has been treated so irresponsibly these past few days that not only people are making inaccurate statements such as &quot;the Amazon provides 20% of our oxygen&quot;, but also high profile people such as Emmanuel Macron (France&#x27;s President) and Cristiano Ronaldo (World famous soccer player) are sharing false information and photos[1]<p>[1] <a href=""http:&#x2F;&#x2F;translate.google.com&#x2F;translate?hl=&amp;sl=pt&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fg1.globo.com%2Ffato-ou-fake%2Fnoticia%2F2019%2F08%2F22%2Fveja-o-que-e-fato-ou-fake-sobre-as-queimadas-na-amazonia.ghtml&amp;sandbox=1"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;translate.google.com&#x2F;translate?hl=&amp;sl=pt&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http...</a>"

"This wouldn&#x27;t be anywhere near as severe a problem as it is if Steam&#x27;s service wasn&#x27;t running as something as ridiculously privileged as NTAUTHORITY\SYSTEM.<p>On the plus side, reading the writeup [0] it seems unlikely that this affects the Linux client (or even if it does, it&#x27;s at least limited to the current user account).

"&quot;2. Seek out problems and iterate;&quot;<p>This is bad advice. It&#x27;s like saying &quot;go into a bar and start picking up fights&quot;.<p>If some part of the software has problems, runs slow or has bugs but <i>nobody</i> is complaining, then there&#x27;s no problem. Why waste time improving it?<p>Almost 100% of the time when you solve a problem you just create new problems of different kind in turn.<p>Be lazy. The less code you write the better off you are."
"So cloudflare basically fucks over 8chan over some skimpy mass shooting evidence, and now has a public offering as a corporate company? Get rid of free speech as internet police and sell stock and make millions?"
"The biggest and (maybe) the only problem are the incentives for LEO to manipulate proof to jail &#x2F;convict innocent people. Even an arrest can ruin your life, let alone trial, regardless of outcome.<p>Other than that, insurance companies have a right to cut down on fraud and jail fraudsters."
"Hi, author here,<p>I understand the critics against the subjective criteria like &quot;Look&quot;.<p>Look means: the ability to create a native app which is at least beautiful as modern WebApps.<p>e.g. Slack or VSCode (Electron) are beautiful, while fractal or NoteCase (Gtk) are not."
"I&#x27;ve been doing detection classes with our Polish Hunting Spaniel and she&#x27;s quite the natural, but the hardest part of it is training the human (i.e. me) to NOT give off any queues about where I think things may be.<p>Of course, these are fun classes and in no way controlled environments - but the best thing you can do is to trust the dog&#x27;s judgement."
"So if I choose to import cookies to Brave (which is the default option on first launch), I will have these preset cookies from other browsers as well?"
"Careful how you respond to spoofed ID calls.<p>There is no one, either individual or business, that has the same area code and prefix as my cell phone and would have any reason to call me, so when I see my area code and prefix in the caller ID, I know it is a spam call.<p>For quite a while, I&#x27;d respond by immediately declining the call, but I wasn&#x27;t careful how I did it. It turned out I was not just hanging up or sending them to voice mail--I was hanging up <i>and</i> sending back a text message that said something like &quot;I&#x27;m not available right now&quot;.<p>Of course the text message does not go to the spammer. It goes to the person whose number is being spoofed, who would then sometimes text me or call me trying to find out who I was and why I suddenly text them out of the blue.<p>Take a moment to make sure you know what the various call decline options on your phone actually do."
The title&#x27;s pun is terrible.
"Another cool metric that&#x27;s used commonly when measuring quality difference between two texts is a BLEU score (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;BLEU"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;BLEU</a>)"
I deal with OpenGL a lot so glxgears has been my standby.  If it&#x27;s just X I&#x27;m testing I&#x27;ve always used xclock.
"perl5 needed a single switch to make it loosey-goosey anything goes otherwise have use strict and -w by default.<p>That one decision cost the language so very much. I miss Perl. Python is what was pushed on me by employers and it&#x27;s fine, it&#x27;s perfectly acceptable. As is ruby and many others but I just miss Perl.<p>I hope the Perl6&#x2F;Raku folks get things happening in their tech and perception of it the way they might like. I think they deserve a break."
So every program starts with a delay!  Would be better to calibrate the delay only when its needed.

"For me, the biggest pain points I face with CRMs are in integrations and customizations. Even Zendesk Sell+Support was awful when integrating to our ecom app. Does this CRM offer anything better in this area?"
probably need to check the update release notes if there is any mention about fixing this on the devices.
I&#x27;m sure this will work out for the parties who are frequently discriminated against. Safety is a concern but you sure better prepare yourself legally for what&#x27;s coming.
"It&#x27;s really great how he pushed so hard to open source the previous generation of each game when releasing a new one. It&#x27;s hard to tell how much that pushed the industry forward, but I&#x27;m sure a <i>lot</i> of people became better C programmers as a result.<p>The &quot;smell in VR&quot; kits in this interview were interesting. I hadn&#x27;t realized so much progress had been made on that front (or that it would take so much to make it as convincing as visual input)."
"I recently upgraded from a 2015 MBP to the latest 2019 MBP, and I actually think it surpasses the older model in almost every way. So far I haven&#x27;t experienced any of the keyboard issues that people have been reporting, although I&#x27;m aware that this model has a membrane that was put in to prevent those issues. My only gripe is the need to have a dongle to connect HDMI and USB 2.0, but I still wouldn&#x27;t go back to the 2015 over it.<p>On a side note, I bought a new iPhone SE to see how it compared to the iPhone XS because HN raves about the SE so much. It was pretty underwhelming and there was just absolutely no way I could justify replacing the XS with it."
"Is battery life still a thing?  I listen to music all day on my phone and still have some large amount of battery left at the end of the day.  I know other people are heavier users of their phone, but I feel like the paranoia about battery life kind of went away several years ago."

"we&#x27;ve been living in our current house for 11 years. it is a little over a km from the beach in Denmark, it has big doors that open onto the front porch and in a direct line with those doors are the windows in the bathroom, in the summer if we had both open we never experienced the house getting hot.

"I think today the Javascript ecosystem looks much better than 3 years ago, at the peak of Javascript fatigue.<p>What we had actually was tooling fatigue, and not language features fatigue. Today, with CLI tools like the Angular CLI, we have a ready to use optimized bundle via one out of the box CLI command, so no longer do we have to learn how to configure Gulp or Webpack.<p>I&#x27;m very glad that I decided not to learn Webpack and stick to the CLI, now Webpack is going to be replaced by Bazel transparently, and from a user perspective, nothing changes other than getting an even faster build and a smaller bundle transparently, without having to be a build tools expert.<p>I can now focus on developing the application and not the tooling, which is awesome for me. There are only so many hours in the day and I like to focus my learning budget on what moves the needle most."
It looks like the author is most bothered by compile times of dependencies.<p>Cargo needs to do better with shared caches (so you compile each dep at most once per machine) or ability to get precompiled crates (so you don&#x27;t even compile it).<p>Incremental improvements of compiler speed or trimming of individual dependencies won&#x27;t bring the 10x improvement it needs.

I have partial floorplans, I made a reasonable SketchUp model (I counted bricks in the pictures to get accurate measurements) but I&#x27;m nowhere near my goal, which would be having a complete, photorealistic 3D model I can drop load in Unreal or Unity and make a VR walkthrough (I can only imagine how that would blow my mum&#x27;s mind!)<p>I&#x27;ve thought of outsourcing this, e.g. find a talented game environment artist or architectural modeller and pay them to do this, but I fear the result will be &quot;off&quot;.

"The only way to fix traffic is to fix the problem plaguing virtually every human in the world right now: the inability to be deliberate, focused, and mindful about the task that they’re currently engaged in.<p>Doesn’t matter what bandaids we slap on it, more rail, more carpool lanes, wider roads, etc... those are all treatments to the symptoms not the root cause.<p>I would posit that if people were mindful and conscious about driving, traffic would improve dramatically.

How is it? How did you find people to practice with?<p>7) What is the inflection point (in terms of raw # of vocabulary) to being able to understand Japanese anime or drama?

"I have been a user of LXC and LXD since 2013. Earlier when docker was based on LXC I tried it. Then Docker went its own path and build its own libcontainer library. During that time LXC project added support for unprivileged container and since than I didn&#x27;t use docker. Still today when majority of container runtime including kubernetes is based on docker container (some on OCI), I continue to use LXD and LXC.<p>LXD by default has been more secure given it allowed unprivileged containers very early that works very nicely. Recently when there was a security problem with Kubernetes, I was still ok given we only used unprivileged containers.<p>I love LXD container being lightweight compared to kubernetes and same ansible or other platform orchestration like puppet, chef can work with baremetla, VM and containers and no need to fiddle with shell scripts, Dockerfile and learning container orchestration specific domain specific language (DSL). Hopefully LXD gets more popular.<p>So far OpenStack, OpenNebula and Proxmox support native LXD containers besides KVM and other virtualization. For most of the small website with thousands or million users LXD itself can work pretty well without relying on any cloud orchestration platform."
"This was obviously never going to work; I think it&#x27;s far more interesting as a piece of morality theater and&#x2F;or a psychological ink-blot test. Because who looks at a system like this (individual humans carted around extravagantly in an energy-intensive, 4,000-pound CO2-belching murder machine, on an expensive and space-intensive road created <i>just for them</i>) and thinks, you know what&#x27;s wrong with this system? <i>It doesn&#x27;t generate enough energy.</i> Mmm yeah, you&#x27;re almost right. Sort of like how a violent person doesn&#x27;t generate enough not-punching-people. Keep going with that reasoning. See if you can use the phrase &quot;in the first place&quot; in your answer.<p>It&#x27;s fascinating. Obviously they seem to grasp the system has something wrong with it, and the problem has something to do with energy. But when that line of thought begins to lead them inexorably toward the conclusion that <i>they should actually probably stop driving immediately, like today</i>, they take a quick left turn into something else, anything else, whatever&#x27;s available and &quot;green&quot; - SOLAR, let&#x27;s do the solar. That&#x27;ll absolve our sins. Hence, where do you place the panels? In the road, where the sin occurred.<p>It&#x27;s like the dim awareness of our actual transportation&#x2F;energy predicament, is in the cellar of their subconscious, knocking at the door to enter conscious awareness, but not quite managing to get the person&#x27;s attention. The mental contortions required to actually like this idea, remind me a lot of the ones required to maintain various states of denial. The fact being desperately avoided of course is that a set of changes far more sweeping and less pleasant than they&#x27;re willing to admit or allow, are going to be necessary."

"&gt; <i>Overall, good engineers are so much more effective not because they produce a lot more code, but because the decisions they make save you from work you did not know could be avoided.</i><p>This is spot on, and very much my experience (of the good engineers I&#x27;ve come across).<p>Kind of : management had planned extensive and painful testing of a component that turned out to be discarded entirely (not because of functionality reduction but because it was actually unecessary)."

"I&#x27;ve always thought that the main reason for Starbucks to push their card and reward program is to save on per-transaction credit card fees.<p>By my understanding, in the US, typical merchant fees to accept a card are a flat $0.20-$0.30 transaction fee, plus 2-3% of the total dollar amount.<p>The article mentions the interchange fee (the 2-3%), but for small purchases the transaction fee is more significant.<p>I assume the majority of purchases are individuals buying a single beverage. If an average drink costs $4, a $0.30 transaction fee alone is eating 7.5% of your gross revenue. That&#x27;s an absolutely huge amount.<p>Even if Starbucks cards are bought&#x2F;topped up with a credit card, that $0.30 fee is being amortized over $20+ worth of product instead of $4 worth.<p>I also figured this tied in with Starbucks&#x27; contract with Square some years back - as one of Square&#x27;s value props is eliminating the per-transaction fee for credit cards. Not sure why that was cancelled, though."

A subtle point that is often missed is that only a growing plant population and ecosystem will have a positive oxygen balance and negative CO2 balance (trapping CO2 as tree biomass at ever increasing volume). Stable ecosystems reach an equilibrium and the carbon cycle stabilizes and net oxygen&#x2F;CO2 production consumption becomes zero.<p>To increase net oxygen levels  in the atmosphere and reduce CO2 levels we would also have to eliminate a lot of the microorganisms that help recycle dead trees and go back to the Paleozoic era and before when these organisms didn&#x27;t exist and the Earth witnessed several glaciation events.<p>Adding more stable forests to the world does not reduce CO2 levels or increase oxygen levels (relative to after it becomes a stable forest). It just speeds up the carbon cycle.
"In the 90s there was a popular, now-forgotten CRM&#x2F;bookkeeping system for MS-DOS called Vega. When they launched version 2.0, the founder&#x2F;CEO boasted to the press about how 2.0 was old hat, and how they were working on 3.0, which was going to be so much better. Subsequently, almost nobody bought 2.0, because the current product worked well enough and they wanted to hold out for 3.0. I believe the company went under as a result."

"I failed when I got bored and copied the text, but I&#x27;m slightly proud of my random thoughts.<p>----<p>On one summer night, I was staring at the sky pondering the mystery of the universe.  Why are we here?  What are we?  What is consciousness?  Does consciousness exist outside of the body?
Where do we go when we die?  How did the universe come to be?  Is God the answer?  Why are the laws of the universe set precisely the way they are?  The answer can&#x27;t be the multi-verse, because in that situation there are an infinite number of universes.<p>In an infinite number of universes, an infinite amount of possibilities exist.  That means, in any given unverse, ANYTHING can and will happen.<p>That means, in one of them, as I&#x27;m typing this silly nonsense, a naked clown will kick in my door, but he will be killed before he attempts to strangle me by a piece of debris that crashes through the roof, which let loose from an airliner flying overhead.<p>If that&#x27;s not weird enough, in one of those other infinite universes, he won&#x27;t be attempting to strangle me, he will have a butcher knife.  In another one, he will have a shotgun.<p>In another universe, he won&#x27;t kick in the door, but will blow it up with grenades.  And in one, he won&#x27;t be naked, but dressed in a tuxedo.  In one universe, the plane would drop an engine on him.  Or me.  Or it won&#x27;t be an engine, it will be a large piece of frozen lavatory ice.<p>This doesn&#x27;t seem logical, although Donald Trump did just attempt to purchase Greenland, which does seem very odd and very random."

"I&#x27;ll say it: I think YAML is great and a joy to use for configuration files. I can write it even with the dumbest editor, I can write comments, multi-line strings, I can get autocompletion and validation with JSON schema, I can share and reference other values. It allows tools to have config schemas that read like a natural domain specific language, but you already know the syntax. I haven&#x27;t had problems with it at all."

"Karel Čapek&#x27;s name is a perfect example of the ridiculous habit of English-speakers to preserve foreign spelling. As you&#x27;ll notice, ‘Čapek’ isn&#x27;t written in English, as ‘Č’ isn&#x27;t a letter in English alphabet. Now, how many people in English-speaking countries know how to pronounce Czech letters? I&#x27;ve heard the name pronounced as ’Kahpek‘ or ‘Kaypek’ (e.g. right in the Librivox book linked in the thread). But it&#x27;s actually [tʃapɛk], which would be better represented as ‘Chapek’.<p>Apparently, since English-speakers have no idea how to pronounce English words that they didn&#x27;t memorize beforehand, they also gave up on the idea of representing foreign words phonemically. But they still keep trying to <i>read</i> them that way if they see vaguely-Latin alphabet."

"The underlying problem is that reading essays with a careful critical eye is <i>not</i> scalable. But another issue this highlights is the complete misalignment of incentives of the people who greenlit the adoption of this technology. Because educational outcomes are much harder to evaluate over the course of a bureaucrat&#x27;s tenure than budget sizes (longer time horizon and many exogenous variables), there is a natural inclination to make decisions that reduce costs as long as they don&#x27;t have any <i>obvious</i> (to them or their superiors) adverse outcome for students. This is a pretty low bar, especially so given that most bureaucrats do not have the background necessary to evaluate technical solutions."

Bluetooth audio + maps on a phone holder seemed like it was perfectly fine, and putting myself even further into the Apple ecosystem felt unnecessary. In short, I had always considered an auto&#x27;s entertainment system&#x2F;software to be something to ignore.<p>Renting a car with CarPlay for a week (and a reasonably long &quot;commute&quot; during that time) completely changed my mind. Typically the only reason I ever used a built in car display up to this point was...to set up my phone in Bluetooth. Suddenly I had familiar applications that made that screen useful: Maps, Overcast (podcasts), Messages (read aloud, not displayed, of course), etc. A phone in a holder is, of course, totally acceptable and fine, but as I&#x27;m just starting to consider buying my first car in almost a decade I&#x27;m suddenly looking at CarPlay as a requirement.<p>Other notes on this for those that are interested: A lot of cars with CarPlay also support Android Auto, and they always have a base system if you&#x27;d prefer not to use either.

For example, each network request the mobile app makes to the backend should have a request ID. The mobile app includes that request ID in all its log entries and sends it with the request. The backend plumbs it through everywhere and all its log entries have it, too. If you have multiple instances of things in the backend, like batches of queries sent to a database, log an identifier for them as well.<p>Then you dump all of this into one big index in some semi-structured data store and use the identifiers to pull out all related entries."

"I&#x27;ve used YAML as the format for a config file, and I certainly regret that choice. Trying to explain to someone that doesn&#x27;t know YAML how to edit it without setting them up for failure is quite annoying. There are too many non-obvious ways to screw up, like forgetting the space after the colon or of course bad indentation."
"I worked at Google for quite a while, 2005-2013, and even then, the internal political discussion was pretty toxic, but a lot smaller in scope since there are far fewer people.<p>There were definitely groups meant for discussing politics, and loudmouths like me willingly participated in those - however, it was very uncivil. There was a majority view in the company, and if anyone didn&#x27;t agree with the majority view, the majority engaged in heckling, ridicule, etc. It was already becoming an echo chamber, and as the majority grew, their tactics grew more petty and vicious. However, this was expected in the politics groups, and you knowingly entered that fray.<p>What seems to be happening a lot lately is that politics are spilling over into large, global mailing lists which target a whole geographic region, so many people get involved, and when a company has 200k employees and contractors, you will find some outliers in there who will pick nasty fights.<p>It only makes sense that they&#x27;re cutting down on something that has turned toxic. It&#x27;s a bit disappointing to hear, since I personally enjoyed the occasional, honest discussion with smart people of other viewpoints - these good discussions made the much larger number of ridiculous ones, bearable."

"Probably going to take some heat for this answer, especially as many of the comments here are very negatively Google, but I actually think that was pretty balanced. Sure they&#x27;re (obviously) protecting their own interests, but realistically SO much of the web relies on advertising. I mean, how many startups did we watch over the last 20 years with no real source of revenue (but some of which were actually fun&#x2F;useful) end up doing the whole &quot;we&#x27;ll just use ads&quot; thing? And ultimately as a product owner (web or otherwise), you&#x27;re not going to spend money on ads (and thus fund a whole load the Internet) if you a) can&#x27;t make a return on your ad spend, and b) can&#x27;t understand what and where performs best.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I hate the super spammy intrusive ads, and sometimes retargeting does feel like I&#x27;m being eavesdropped on, but I can&#x27;t be the only one that prefers to see relevant ads? I&#x27;d much rather see ads for sneakers and watches (which I&#x27;ll frequently click), than I would for some other junk that doesn&#x27;t interest me. I genuinely don&#x27;t mind ads if I know it&#x27;s supporting the thing it&#x27;s displaying ads on.<p>And as for the cookie stuff - it&#x27;s a complete mess now. I get that we as a community should probably be spearheading SOME sort of privacy to bubble down to those that don&#x27;t &#x27;get&#x27; it, but talk to the bulk of my non-tech friends and it&#x27;s a non issue. All those cookie popups are clicked without being read (and they never will be read ever get, that behaviour has been established) - the brightest button gets the click and they can move on and get to actually looking at what they wanted. Literally nobody reads, cares or understands. Even the &quot;they&#x27;re selling my data&quot; &#x2F; &quot;they&#x27;re tracking me scandals&quot; - maybe five minutes of outrage and then assuming you can still share cat memes and holiday photos, who cares? Yesterday people were all over Instagram sharing an outraged message that &quot;Instagram have no permission to do what they want with my content&quot; - and yet no one left IG. Everyone is still back today, business as usual.<p>I think at least _exploring_ this whole thing in a way that&#x27;s balanced towards the entire internet ecosystem is way more thoughtful than a knee-jerk &quot;block everything, privacy everything&quot; response. It&#x27;s a pretty emotive topic, and close to a lot of our hearts, but we definitely need more talk. Just my 2c!"
"A priori, the most believable thesis to me would be that <i>Finding Dory</i> increased both interest in keeping blue tang fish as pets and generic internet searches about them.<p>It&#x27;s also misleading to conflate keeping members of a species as pets with damaging the wild population. This is something that is obviously related in some cases (e.g. giant pandas) and obviously unrelated in others (e.g
 dogs). I don&#x27;t know much about the ecosystem in which blue tang live, but I&#x27;d expect most aquarium fish to be more like dogs than pandas in this comparison."
"I&#x27;m super happy that games that look and feel like those from Spiderweb Software exist. I think it&#x27;s charming. But the fact that he feels compelled to write an article in <i>defense</i> of the art style is telling to me. I think it&#x27;s not unreasonable to answer the headline question with &quot;because they&#x27;re stubborn&quot;.<p>Their games look crap, not because of a lack of resources but because of a disrespect for visual design (it&#x27;s not even &quot;art&quot;, they could make a better looking game with colored squares). There&#x27;s probably many, many ways to improve the look that have nothing to do with &quot;AAA art&quot;. He fails to see how Baba Is You is a better looking game than any of theirs, simply because it&#x27;s focused and has a good use of color and contrast. Any $10&#x2F;hour freelance game artist can tell him that the problem with the games is a mismatch in detail, between background and characters, between resolution and texture detail. This makes tiles look either blurry or covered in white noise and together with a sever lack of contrast, makes the game look flat and unlit.<p>Solving that doesn&#x27;t require hiring expensive artists, it first involves acknowledging there&#x27;s an issue at the core that can&#x27;t be solved by sticking stuff on top of it. I see zero patience or passion for that and that&#x27;s why their games look the same as 25 years ago (and I could argue, <i>worse</i>, since higher resolution doesn&#x27;t do them any favors).<p>Again, I have no problem with their games and them looking like they do but going into defense here is a battle they can&#x27;t win. Their best move is to acknowledge that they don&#x27;t care and do so with pride. Everything else just feels at best insecure and at worst somewhat disrespectful towards devs who care."
"I think this is super neat!<p>And I could really see a use case for when bandwidth is a problem for true video calls... next to full video, streaming the avatar info would be next to nothing - so it could turn &quot;video&quot; calls into basically just the audio as far as the internet connection is concerned.<p>Awesome!"

"People who quote &quot;premature optimization is etc.&quot; never provide the full quote. The full quote has a significant degree of highly important nuance.<p>&gt; &quot;Programmers waste enormous amounts of time thinking about, or worrying about, the speed of noncritical parts of their programs, and these attempts at efficiency actually have a strong negative impact when debugging and maintenance are considered. We should forget about small efficiencies, say about 97% of the time: premature optimization is the root of all evil. Yet we should not pass up our opportunities in that critical 3%.&quot;<p>&quot;Premature optimization is the root of all evil&quot; is incomplete without the surrounding context, and people unfortunately take it to mean &quot;never worry about how efficient your code is,&quot; which is not at all what Knuth intended."
"This is actually a pretty good list. Obviously it&#x27;s personal and specific to him but it gives food for thought.<p>With that said I&#x27;ve read a million posts like this and the only thing that&#x27;s ever made me feel like I had genuinely changed my perspective and understood what was happening more clearly was reading the Getting Things Done book.<p>The key insight for me is that so much of procrastination results from a lack of clarity about what exactly should be done next, and keeping a mental load of trying to keep track of everything. Separating the three basic concepts of planning, making decisions, and actually doing the work, into discrete sessions, has been a life changer.<p>I still fuck off constantly and hate myself for procrastination from time to time, obviously, but using the core GTD framework and returning to it when I stray has <i>really</i> helped."

I was thinking recently, &quot;huh, these pipelines aren&#x27;t easily version controlled at all&quot;. Unless you use something that is completely configurable by text, which is pretty hard to accomplish, then it&#x27;s basically impossible to get a snapshot of your services. It&#x27;s even harder to roll stuff back. Or branch it off and test out a new configuration. I&#x27;d wager that a lot of issues in production are configuration related, simply because it&#x27;s harder to introspect and code review versus code changes. Hopefully that can be fixed."

"I replaced the radio in my 2016 Toyota Prius V because the software was sooo bad. It was the only model in 2016 that didn&#x27;t support hands free Siri, They pushed out a final update to etune 2.0 removing features as it moved into maintenance mode, and it crashed and rebooted on hands free calls.<p>I bought my new radio from crutchfield.com, they did all the compatibility checking for me, suggested all the additional adapters and devices for best compatibility, and for $25 spliced all the wiring harnesses for me. I installed it myself, and have been very happy with the results. I now have wireless carplay, so handsfree works great, I can easily get directions&#x2F;eta while driving, I can easily listen to podcasts, and as a bonus I get visual information on various car sensors, like which door is ajar, and the PSI of each tire. The most important feature is that it hasn&#x27;t crashed once.<p>The result has been better than I expected, there were somethings that weren&#x27;t quite obvious, such as there not existing OEM adapters for the hands free mic and the gps receiver for my model of toyota. But ultimately, it wasn&#x27;t hard to run the new mic and the new gps sensor that came with the radio out through the seams of the dash. The handsfree audio quality is way better with the new radio&#x27;s mic. Everything else integrated with the OEM hardware of the car."

"These are quite common in Gloucestershire but you would not know it unless you have some reason to be invited to the big houses that have estates.<p>The health and safety considerations cited in the Wikipedia page don&#x27;t apply to the ha-ha walls that are situated in sizeable estates. The big house, the extensive gardens and the fields beyond are owned by the same family. It has all been inherited rather than bought with &#x27;new money&#x27;. The family and the staff know where the wall is and random members of the public just don&#x27;t have access to the area, in part because of the ha-ha. The surrounding fields are not open to the public either.<p>Others may use the ha-ha in a modern context to hide a car park in a hilly city setting but this is not a true ha-ha wall. These fake ha-ha walls are also for postage stamp sized plots of land. A real ha-ha is at the end of formal gardens that are so big that only gardening staff would need to go that far out from the house. The lawns should be big enough for erecting a marquee, having a large croquet lawn or whatever else goes with having a house that size.<p>In the true country setting, e.g. Gloucestershire or another English shire, there are far worse hazards. A child could fall from a hay barn onto some combine harvester. Or a sheep dip with those neuro-toxin chemicals could be a grizzly end. Normal cows or the bull in a field could get you too. Hopping over a barbed wire fence might not kill you but isn&#x27;t necessarily easy. Only a stupid, trespassing city dweller who should not be in the countryside under any circumstances could possibly fall off a real ha-ha and any ha-ha that is not part of a grand estate is not a real ha-ha.<p>Rivers and flood prevention can also provide a good excuse for a stately home to have a version of the ha-ha. This will be a ditch arrangement with a berm, this hides the riff-raff using the riverside path and the ironwork that takes the place of a wall for keeping them out."

"&gt; Hinton has said that when he was growing up, his mother gave him two choices: “Be an academic or be a failure.” His family tree is branch-breakingly weighted with scientists. His great-great-grandfather was George Boole, founder of Boolean logic, familiar to anyone who has done a “Boolean search.” One of George Boole’s sons-in-law was Charles Howard Hinton, Geoffrey’s great-grandfather, a mathematician and sci-fi writer who coined the concept of a “tesseract” (a four-dimensional object we can see in the 3-D world as a cube—well known to all readers of the classic children’s novel A Wrinkle in Time), and who ended up in the U.S.<p>Interesting fact from reading this that normally gets  neglected in media."

"I have a better idea, bake in ID in browsers, then make the website&#x2F;script request the ID and the user can choose if they want to  identify themselves or not. A basic  ID should only be a public key. Then the browser can make a &quot;signup&quot; request where they can get more info about the user. The user id can then be used for a passwordless login. Kinda like Google or Github ID but built into the browser, standardized and easy for developers to integrate. For extra security client certificates can be used (but current implementations need to be overhauled) and second factor hardware keys can be used for additional security. Ad publisher do not need to have the same level of security as bank id, so there need to be something very basic and easy to implement as well."
"As much as SHAKEN&#x2F;STIR is a fun tech, I think the article misses the part which will actually hurt the callers:<p>&gt; Require Traceback Cooperation in Contracts. For all new and renegotiated contracts

investigations by identifying the upstream provider from which the suspected 
illegal robocall entered its network or by identifying its own customer if the call originated

"There&#x27;s a difference between a conscious choice to maintain a certain style or level of detail, and a lack of willingness to improve said style. The whole article reads to me less like &quot;I don&#x27;t want to upgrade to 3D or higher detail&quot; and more like &quot;I&#x27;m too comfortable to want to improve the current art by putting in 10% more detail&quot;.<p>Disclaimer: I&#x27;m not a business owner and don&#x27;t work in the games industry. My opinions are that of a layman from the (sometimes similar) maze of the development agency sector.<p>Lesson 1 is correct. Perfectionism will always be there.<p>Lesson 2 has a false premise that the amount of effort and cost to increase art quality is more than the value gained in sales and profit. It&#x27;s not wrong that hiring more people will be a bit of a gamble, but also putting more time in it to iron out kinks is an alternative step. If you&#x27;re a business owner then long hours are the norm, no?<p>Lesson 3 is just putting the blame on the freelancers. Yes it&#x27;s hard to find talent and yes it&#x27;s hard to afford it, but that shouldn&#x27;t be an excuse to just give up on trying to strive for better.<p>Lesson 4 I agree with.

And you can read.<p>Yes you learn to read slow at first, and then you develop fast reading by yourself, it&#x27;s natural and comes with reading a lot. I don&#x27;t know anybody reading sound-by-sound past the age of 10, and usually kids learn to read whole words after they read their first long book (traditionally it&#x27;s &quot;Kids from Bullerbyn&quot; here).<p>I wonder how much longer it takes to teach kids reading such complicated writing system like English.

"Moving from car centered sprawl, to dense transit oriented city isn&#x27;t something that can be done in one step.

"I was very fortunate that my university had a ton of old Lisp books, and after browsing through a bunch of them I found some really good ones and learned from those.  Unfortunately, I don&#x27;t remember the titles (though a book on CLOS stands out in my memory as being an excellent introduction to the awesome power of OO programming in Lisp), but if you have a university with a good comp sci library you may want to check it out.<p>Parenthetically, I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s true but I&#x27;d heard that there have been more books published on Lisp than all books on other programming languages combined.<p>I&#x27;d also recommend that anyone who starts out with Common Lisp give a modern Scheme (like Chicken, Racket, or Guile) a try.  I found Scheme to be much more to my taste and once I learned it I viewed CL as quite backwards in many ways, so Scheme is what I use today if I can at all help it.<p>Finally, newbies should check out Emacs and eLisp.  eLisp is more primitive than either CL or Scheme, but it&#x27;s still great when combined with Emacs, which you can customize and improve to your heart&#x27;s content.  In addition, there&#x27;s a mountain of eLisp code to build on for you Emacs improvement projects.  I came to eLisp after learning both CL and Scheme, so it was pretty easy to pick up, and that&#x27;s what I&#x27;d recommend others do too, just so you first learn what Lisp is truly capable of."

"I like the article but this nit bugs me:<p>&gt;Some residents can afford more expensive homes as a limited supply increases demand, but those that can’t are pushed away into more precarious living situations and longer commutes.<p>Limited supply doesn&#x27;t affect demand, they&#x27;re largely independent unless you look at induced demand, but that mostly affects things like roads and power lines. It should say something like:<p>&gt;As demand rises, the limited supply increases price.<p>or<p>&gt;As supply outstrips demand, prices become unaffordable for large segments of the population.<p>It&#x27;s just slightly wrong to indicate a causal relationship between supply and demand in the housing market, which is kinda what this whole page is about."

I&#x27;ve thought about this a decent amount and I just can&#x27;t agree that unsupervised outdoor wandering is a good thing before maybe middle school. Kids are stupid and even the smart ones get peer pressured into doing stupid things that can injure or kill them. Like when I crushed my wrist riding a bike downhill on a paved road in 2nd or 1st grade. Those kids apparently rode on roads all the time which looking back seems irresponsible as hell.<p>Unsupervised in a house or on a property in a good area is fine too. I just can&#x27;t agree with letting small kids wander into cities or roads or forests on their own.<p>On the other hand I feel like open-ended and&#x2F;or educational video games like Minecraft fill a similar need for self determination&#x2F;experimentation&#x2F;exploration just fine to a degree.

"&gt;&gt; I could see all this. Why couldn&#x27;t they?<p>Having worked mind-numbing jobs like packer at a warehouse, I can assure you
that most people can see &quot;all this&quot; just as clearly as Bukowski. Like
Bukowski, they are unable to do anything to change &quot;how things are&quot;, but
unlike Bukowski they don&#x27;t have a guaridan angel to lift them off the daily
rat race and into a successful creative career. More importantly, perhaps,
unlike Bukowski, many of those people have responsibilities, specifically to
their families and particularly their kids, responsibilities that they
recognise and that they usually accept. Or in any case, those who accept those
responsibilities give up any dreams of a &quot;free&quot; life and do what best they can
to fulfil those responsibilities. If that means working at a 9-to-not-quite-5
job that eats you from the inside, because there is no better option, then
that&#x27;s what it means.<p>But Bukowski asks: why do people have children? Because that&#x27;s what people do,
if you look around you. People make more people. Perhaps we are all slaves of
evolution that has programmed us this way but a sizeable chunk of people find
that they love their children even before they have them, even if they find
that they can never have them. Some people are not like that and some can&#x27;t
even stand the idea of having children. Perhaps those people are lucky,
perhaps they are the real unlucky ones. Who knows."

I&#x27;m not sure if this is enough to explain why Lysine is used in proteins but it&#x27;s an interesting result anyway.<p>In the more optimistic case, the research article &quot;explain&quot; why the 3 usual amino acids that they used are better than the 3 shorter variants that they used. It doesn&#x27;t &quot;explain&quot; why the other 17 amino acids where selected.<p>In particular they used amino acids with an additional amino group, so the polymerization can get &quot;confused&quot; and instead of using the usual amino group use the other group, so instead of a nice chain, you get some other structure. There are 17 of the other usual amino acids that don&#x27;t have an additional amino group, so the polymerization process can&#x27;t get confused."

It would be ideal to work directly with the composite video.<p>Working with the composite video also would have implications for archiving VHS and other tape-based analog footage: right now, folks tend to use hardware devices called TBCs (time base correctors) to correct issues in the video signal from a VHS player. These are all obsolete at this point and growing increasingly expensive, so it would be nice to replace this hardware with software."

"I&#x27;ve looked at MIPS and Wavecell helmets for bicycling. When I looked at the analysis and research, it seemed that MIPS makes more sense for snow sports, where your helmet can get stuck in snow and twist.

So I passed on getting a MIPS helmet for biking (though I should probably get one for snowboarding).<p>When I looked at the literature on Wavecell, it seemed to be of the &quot;up to 40x better&quot; variety. To a lay person like myself, that seemed suspicious because I have no idea what the common accident types are, and the literature didn&#x27;t seem to indicate that it was more protective in the common scenarios. The article linked here does seem to make that case, but as others have noted it reads a bit like an advertisement.<p>I am actually planning on getting on getting one of these helmets simply because its shape fits my head very well, and in talking with cyclists I&#x27;ve been told that having a shape that fits your head (mine is apparently more &quot;circular&quot; than &quot;oblong&quot;) is the most important thing."

However, unlike on the 2018 one, holding the keyboard upside down and blowing at close range at the keys whilst toggling them managed to rapidly fix the problem.<p>I also haven&#x27;t had any double presses yet (which were the plague of the 2018 one - the symptoms were identical to <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wsj.com&#x2F;graphics&#x2F;apple-still-hasnt-fixed-its-macbook-keyboard-problem&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wsj.com&#x2F;graphics&#x2F;apple-still-hasnt-fixed-its-mac...</a>).

"There has been a lot of work like this popping up in the past year. I think it&#x27;s somewhat promising, but for ML for ITPs to really become useful, I think the models need to better take into account semantic information about terms and types and not just tactics. And this is not easy, because Coq&#x27;s logic is higher-order and dependently typed, and most work in ML for PL deals with much simpler logics. Still, anything that helps with the tedium is welcome.<p>Another problem is that you will very rarely find examples of failing proofs, since users rarely commit them. I&#x27;m working on a joint UW-UCSD project on collecting and analyzing development data, and this is one of the goals. But our dataset is not very large, since it is hard to get users to agree to something so invasive, and there are still only 1000 or so active Coq users in total in the world right now.<p>Another big problem is that it is very, very difficult to define what it means for a proof to be &quot;almost&quot; correct. This makes it difficult to apply many existing techniques fruitfully.<p>Nonetheless, I think the general spirit is right. The biggest gains in proof automation in ITPs this decade are going to come from automation that makes use in some way of existing proofs, rather than starting from scratch and &quot;blindly&quot; (often very effectively or even decideably for certain fragments of the logic or certain domains if the user knows the right tactic to call) searching for some term with a given type."

"That’s a hell of a clickbait headline for a supposed paper of record. I don’t even disagree with the premise. It doesn’t make it less disgusting though.<p>That aside, the weight of this sits on the parents, not society. Parents dump their children into scholastic programs and extra curriculars not because of the results, they do so because they’re lazy and refuse to do the tasks themselves. They think it’s difficult to discipline children and would rather pay someone to watch their child scribble with crayons while they sip a latte then spend an hour actually reading to them.<p>This also leads to them feeling like the time a child spends “doing nothing” is a bad thing.

"Cost of living increases almost every year.  Value of money decreases somewhat from inflation.  Worker salaries have not been increasing on pace with inflation, much less cost of living increases, since oh... the Reagan years.<p>What has increased dramatically since the Reagan years is executive pay and wealth of top 1%.  What has also increased is consumer debt, particularly during the Clinton years.  At the same time that consumer debt was increasing, interest rates (for consumers, not the prime rate) were climbing quickly to their legal limits.  Also, those legal limits were occasionally being increased.<p>Yes consumers are consuming more stuff, and yes most of that extra consumption is rather wasteful and provides decreasing benefit in terms of quality of life or happiness.  But the rate of some consumption is going down.  Modern computers, TVs, and even mobile phones now can do so much more than most users need that there is less and less reason to upgrade frequently.  Buying a new car every couple of years is a great way to waste money.  But generally speaking, &quot;the people&quot; aren&#x27;t living larger than they did 20-30 years ago.<p>There&#x27;s very little doubt that the vast majority of the value of the increased productivity output has gone to the top 1%.

"Just today, Dutch newspapers reported that courts in the Netherlands are running trial processes against suspected insurance fraudsters without any involvement from the police or the DA&#x27;s office [0].<p>The idea is that the police force is too understaffed to do research against smalltime insurance fraud, but the insurance companies are more than happy to build the case independently. And the judge is still impartial, so everything is fine, right?<p>This worries me because the insurance isn&#x27;t exactly impartial, right? I assume that once they suspect fraud, they <i>really really</i> want you to have indeed committed fraud, because there&#x27;s hardly any downside for them if they wrongly accused you.

"There is an actual problem here, but wireless carriers use the actual problem of how to balance traffic as a fake cover for charging more.<p>However, assuming we bypass the garbage tiering, there is a legitimate reason to do this.  Page-loads are simple and fast.  Every one loading pages is not much of an issue, as they typically load at different times for a brief moment and then are done.  This means for a rated connection speed, you don&#x27;t need as much actual capacity.<p>Video streaming (or other downloads) are constant.  To stream video at rated speeds, you must build to provide most users that speed at the same time.  Problem two here is that in cases of high traffic, video streaming is <i>greedy</i>.  If it&#x27;s not going at full resolution, it will suck up all available bandwidth it is given.  If more is given, it will raise quality (by default settings, at least).<p>A sensible solution to this is to stream video and audio over UDP and have the router just drop UDP when TCP needs bandwidth (to a point).  The point is, requirements are different.  People sending e-mails shouldn&#x27;t have to wait a minute to send because you <i>really</i> want to stream your netflix every where you go and in 4k.<p>Which reminds me, I thought mobile connections were for simple stuff.  Light browsing, email, what-have-you.  Even with &quot;unlimited&quot; plans, you&#x27;re throttled after twenty-odd gigabytes of data per month.  Why can&#x27;t people just download netflix in advance?  Failing that, I&#x27;m not sure why people expect to use a wireless internet connection in the same way as a wired one."

"For those wondering why anyone would buy such a thing, consider:<p>- Many financial institutions are required to hold a certain percent of portfolio in safe assets. German bunds are among the safest in the world.<p>- A holder of a bond earns a capital gain (bond goes up in price) when interest rates fall. In that sense, zero is no limit at all because there can always be a buyer willing to accept an even lower (more negative) yield.<p>- Bond investors are well-aware of the two points above. When they sense that interest rates and&#x2F;or inflation are headed lower, they know they can profit by buying, regardless of yield.<p>- Anticipated rate of inflation matters a lot because investors seeking return through yield focus on real interest rates (nominal rate - inflation). Inflation can be negative as well (deflation). If inflation is lower (more negative) than the bond&#x27;s nominal return, that&#x27;s a real <i>positive yield</i>. And that positive yield is locked in for the term of the bond, which in the case of the story is 30 years.<p>- The European Central Bank has repeatedly signaled its belief that zero is no barrier and that negative yields will be tolerated indefinitely. The ECB stands ready for quantitative easing (QE), in which the central bank buys bonds with money it creates from thin air. Investors know this and this compounds the incentive to pile on and buy bonds to enjoy the capital gains (and real returns if the investor believes that deflation is inevitable).<p>It&#x27;s likely that all these factors combine to create the current environment. How long all of this can continue is anybody&#x27;s guess because the situation is without precedent.<p>It&#x27;s as if the financial crisis of 2008 was never resolved - just papered over through massive central bank purchases of treasuries and stocks (Japan&#x27;s central bank owns a major fraction of the value of the Japanese stock market at this point)."

"I used qmail for about ten years. It was remarkably good from a sysadmin&#x27;s perspective:<p>- the config system mostly used the name of a directory where lots of software would use a filename (qmail.ini =&gt; &#x2F;var&#x2F;qmail&#x2F;conf), the name of a file where other software would use a variable name, and the contents of the file as the value of the variable. This is really, really easy to read and write without writing a parsing library.<p>- separate executables do separate jobs, with well-documented interfaces between them. Oh, and if a part didn&#x27;t need root, it didn&#x27;t run as root, and if a part didn&#x27;t need to be the same user as another, it didn&#x27;t share users. While it was easiest to replace something at the edge of the graph, it was entirely possible to replace middle jobs as well.<p>- qmail was the original design home of Maildir. I approve of various Maildir++ implementations (nesting folders is useful) and you could add support for them by replacing your delivery agent.<p>- qmail expected to be controlled by daemontools, a supervision system that has inspired&#x2F;been blatantly copied and improved upon as runit, perp, s6, and nosh.

"I think the final point is where there is the most leverage- giving preference to long term ownership interests over short term interests.  Time based voting preferences, longer minimum holding periods for manager stock grants, more tax differential on long and short term gains and similar policies have potential to create an environment which is not as focused on the daily stock price and the quarterly numbers.  Having the company serve the purpose of its owners is not a bad thing, otherwise the concept of ownership is meaningless, but if the intention of some of those owners is to briefly increase its value or liquidate assets to increase short term returns at the expense of longer term returns, that seems worthy of disincentivizing."

"I&#x27;m in a major city, and the grid isn&#x27;t very stable, but stable enough for me to get an electric vehicle that I need to charge once a week. Solar panels are easy to get, but the utilities are realizing that nett metering isn&#x27;t a good deal for them - my otherwise high electricity bill will be zero if I get solar panels, and so they have no incentive to service my house.<p>That aside, because our cities are so crowded and generally hot already, everyone is very keenly aware of the heat and smoke diesel and petrol vehicles put out - if electric vehicles are affordable and charging infrastructure is in place, there&#x27;s going to be no problems with adoption. The issue, of course, is that making them affordable and setting up charging infra go against the interests of the oil and gas companies that built India up to where it is so far.<p>To its credit, though, the government seems keen to get things going, even at the expense of breaking earlier promises to big oil and big auto. Now it&#x27;s just figuring out the chicken and egg situation of bringing down costs and setting up infra without clear current demand."

An interesting result in that paper is that the implementations of what Abadi calls isolation notions (which Herlihy and Wing call multi-object correctness criteria) are not modular - at least for (strict) serializability. For example, if two systems implement serializability using two-phase locking and multi-version concurrency control respectively, then they can&#x27;t be modularly composed to get a serializable global system for transactions that span objects from both systems."
"&gt; &quot;There was once a workman who made a glass cup that was unbreakable.

After doing this he thought he had himself seated on the throne of Jupiter, especially when Caesar said to him: &#x27;Does anyone else know how to blow glass like this?&#x27; Just see what happened.

"This has been rumored for some time on various railfan groups across the web and I&#x27;ve always figured it to be true. In a few instances, people have called out that trains are moving too quickly up grades for their supposed load or are way underpowered for a train if all the containers were full. It&#x27;s all been a bit suspect.<p>This has only fueled a lot of skepticism about the BRI. There&#x27;s a few primary reasons for this:<p>1. Break of gauge: Any of the current routes require gauge changes between 5&#x27; and 4&#x27;8.5&quot;. Each time this occurs it incurs either (a) translating costs to move containers from railcar to railcar, or (b) bogie change costs. This both slows it down and adds significant labor expense to the endeavor which reduces competitiveness vs sea. Talgo (in Spain) makes gauge-changing bogies which theoretically can handle this, but they are not designed for the tonnage nor are they particularly well-suited to the extreme conditions found on the routes.<p>2. Axle Loading &amp; Loading Gauge: The axle loads across the different networks are highly variable, requiring cars only be as heavy as the lightest network they travel on.

Major changes in India&#x27;s grid energy are needed before this will yield significant improvements.<p>I was the project lead for a (sadly failed) electric autonomous vehicle project in India, the Amritsar Pod[1]. This was using a technology which, when deployed in the west, is <i>vastly</i> environmentally superior to (say) buses. That&#x27;s for several reasons that are broadly shared with electric rickshaws:<p>1. As a demand-responsive vehicle, it only runs when there is passenger demand. So (aside from empty-vehicle redistribution movements) there is a minimum occupancy of 25% (for a single person in a 4-person vehicle), and in many cases, the average occupancy is closer to 35%-50%. This is in contrast to buses, which need to keep circulating even when there is little or no demand. A full-occupancy bus is very efficient, but a 50-person-capacity bus that is carrying 4 passengers is more polluting, per-person than a single-occupant SUV. This is in fact the case in America, where the average occupancy of urban buses is 9%. In Europe it&#x27;s more like 20-25%. But in both cases, pods are still more efficient.<p>2. As electric vehicles, they of course produce no tailpipe emissions, and are as clean as whatever grid they draw power from.<p>So put these two factors together, and it&#x27;s an environmentally winning proposition <i>in the West</i> (although it hasn&#x27;t caught on there either, yet). But interestingly, this calculation doesn&#x27;t work in India:<p>1. The urban buses are hardly low-occupancy. Average occupancies tend to be around 55%, and can reach 85% in some cases. Replacing these with 25%-50% occupancy pods is only a win if the pods are <i>significantly</i> cleaner.<p>2. The grid energy is horribly dirty.<p>What I found when I did a CO2 analysis of my system is that what would have reduced CO2 by &gt; 90% in the West was merely a break-even proposition in India. Didn&#x27;t increase CO2 -- and would&#x27;ve been worth doing on the basis of travel time savings, pedestrian conflicts, etc. -- but didn&#x27;t actually help with CO2 either. This will be the case for any electric vehicle until India&#x27;s grid becomes significantly cleaner.<p>1: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ultraglobalprt.com&#x2F;wheres-it-used&#x2F;amritsar-india&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ultraglobalprt.com&#x2F;wheres-it-used&#x2F;amritsar-india...</a>"

"I think before we change the system we might want to get politicians to actually do their job and represent the people in their district. With all these people voting by mail and all these government provided or subsidized phones and internet connections it&#x27;s not only trivial but should be mandatory to quantify and qualify what each person who votes wants as a matter of a public record of accountability rather than having some party line being towed. If the politicians were doing their job and not serving some party or political agenda, the electoral college I think would work just fine. Popular vote&#x2F;mob rules? I don&#x27;t think so. The majority should never rule over the minority, and the only good government is a democracy where the majority vote in the best interest of all citizens and compromise in order to do so. Or as I like to sum it up, don&#x27;t confuse a coop game with a competitive game."

"Work on phrasing in a non-combative way, ask questions, and define terms.<p>Communication is a combination of content and delivery. You can have great content but if it is delivered poorly then it is much less likely others will appreciate it. And if you deliver a message with poor content then people might be dazzled by your bullshit but in the long run they will see through it.<p>So work on how you deliver your content. Being someone who likes to argue is fine if you actually mean argue and not insult. If you truly want to learn, ask questions. I have found that is a great way to get good answers online. Say someone writes, &quot;Politician X is horrible.&quot; but I think politician x is great. I will resist my urge to insult or just say &quot;No, you are wrong!&quot; or even &quot;What does that mean?&quot; which can be read as having a nasty tone and instead write, &quot;What are some examples of things you think politican x has done that is horrible?&quot; Then I can decide if this person is worth engaging with. If they give an answer that I think indicates that we are entirely too far apart then I stop engaging and move on.<p>This is also part of what my dissertation advisor beat into my head: define your terms. For example, if someone writes, &quot;Most people believe X&quot; well what does &quot;most&quot; mean? 50.1% is a lot different from 99.9%. If they mean 50.1% then maybe we aren&#x27;t that for apart and we are only disagreeing over whether it is 49.9% or 50.1%."

This is probably your most realistic option anyway. It tends to get old as you get old too. Sometimes it&#x27;s the same arguments (sometimes with the same people, but even without that) get old, or eventually stop mattering to you on an alief level, regardless of your &quot;it does&#x2F;doesn&#x27;t matter&quot; verbal belief level. Sometimes it&#x27;s because you advance your own thinking and then find yourself at a place where it&#x27;s just hard to find people with the same background context, so when you do engage others before you can argue about what you actually want to argue about, you first have to futilely attempt to close the inferential distance they lack because they haven&#x27;t read the books you&#x27;ve read or whatever. It gets old.<p>As a remark on the top comment, I got into Taoist philosophy quite a bit in my teens. It helped (helps) not being attached to outcomes or having a &quot;need&quot; to argue apart from it being pleasurable, it helps cultivate &quot;it doesn&#x27;t really matter&quot; views, but it didn&#x27;t stop me from entering a very argumentative phase anyway. It&#x27;s also fun to just discuss things, but the very act of bringing topics and edge cases and implications thereof up for discussion even if you don&#x27;t strongly hold a conclusion can still comes across as &quot;argumentative&quot;. Oh well.<p>Are these one-on-one chats or group chats you&#x27;re mostly in? As a word of caution, arguing with people one-on-one is a great way to eventually not chat with them at all in the future. (On the other hand not arguing with them is no path to long term conversation either. Not everyone is a creature of the internet.) Sometimes you&#x27;ll find that rare buddy who seems to indulge in your arguing, and can change <i>your</i> mind from time to time too, and they exist, but then some of them are fighting what they perceive to be an attack on their ego rather than what you think is an ego-free discussion trying to reason about a topic and so regardless of the intermediary results the final result of no longer having conversations at all is the same."

I personally wish more companies worked like this.  I know in about six months once i sort out the spend rate for engineering at my startup i am going to be looking at if we can give back either to environment or to open source.  There is an inevitability as the old die off and the young more hyper aware we forge ahead to a less pollution intense world.
Looks really nice but I wonder if you went too far with Basecamp&#x27;s look.<p>The brand colors look so similar that you could get the impression that it&#x27;s a Basecamp product. It almost looks like you took their background color and changed it by the smallest amount possible just so it wasn&#x27;t an exact match if you compared the hex colors.

"&gt;&gt; But despite encouraging results, most of the time I’m reminded that we’re nowhere near achieving human-like AI. Why?<p>Primarily, because we have no idea what intelligence is, or how it works, why it exists even, etc etc. This goes for human-like intelligence, but also for any kind of intelligence. We just have no good scientific understanding of the subject. We have some vague models of it (&quot;the brain is like a computer and the mind is like a program running on it&quot;) but nothing very precise and certainly nothing that can be reproduced on a digital computer, which is what &quot;human-like AI&quot; would be (i.e. human-like AI would be the reproduction of human intelligence on a digital computer).<p>Most likely, until we make some progress in understanding intelligence we will not be able to reproduce it.

"I do a three day week with a corresponding pay cut. Incidentally, this puts me in the same position, time-wise, as women returning from maternity leave, so the shorter hours don&#x27;t mark me out particularly.

"This article argues against the premise that the <i>power and “deep pocket” of the Chinese state can overcome problems that the market cannot solve when left alone</i>, but misses the forest for the trees. Obviously China doesn&#x27;t attempt this category of infrastructure projects because they have to make immediate economic sense. They tackle them for political and long term geostrategic purposes. Some side benefits are that it&#x27;s cheaper than US-style global military hegemony, far more permanent, and more readily accepted by populations. For example our local project <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;HKZMB"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;HKZMB</a> cost USD$18.8B which is less than twelve days of the current US military budget of USD$1.65B per day, a lot cheaper and more acceptable than invading Hong Kong and effectively the crown jewel and literal gateway to one of the most populated areas and busiest shipping lanes on the planet.

"Optimism I believe does have a very positive effect on both productivity of the people and how much they love working in a place.

You have little alternative on things like Go besides removing debugging symbols and doing tricks like &quot;dynamic decompression&quot; (which could also be applied to Rust programs to further reduce their size, btw).<p>Bottom line is: Rust makes it easier for you to &quot;just add a new library&quot; and it also make you more mindful of the bloat, but we need to keep it in perspective."

"I co-manage an ebook to audiobook conversion product <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;auditus.cc"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;auditus.cc</a>. Spending a little time in this space and being an avid audiobook listener myself, I somehow feel that both sides are right on some level. The publishers&#x27; sole goal is to place as many physical copies as they can in people&#x27;s hands. That is why you often hear things like &quot;The feel of paper is what makes the book better&quot;, &quot;this digital reading takes the feel away&quot;, etc. Now if you are listening to a book on Audible and you feel &quot;ah! this book sounds pretty interesting and has some very notable points; I should read this rather than just listening to it!&quot;, you might end up buying a copy of it. But now since Audible has the exact text of the book, you can read it right there while also listening to it, which is obviously better because two faculties of your brain are working on the same thing thus you grasp faster. But clearly that&#x27;s not good for the publisher at all, thus the frowning. On the other hand, audible&#x27;s point that the A.I. generated text is not gonna be an exact replica of the hard copy might be the only and helpful justification they can present."

"Yes, you want to have a single chain of events across all of your infrastructure.  This is called &quot;distributed tracing&quot;.  There are a few solutions available; I recommend Jaeger.<p>You do need to instrument your applications to emit traces, but don&#x27;t go overboard.  Make sure everything can extract the trace ID from headers &#x2F; metadata and that requests they generate include the trace ID.  Most languages have plugins for their HTTP &#x2F; gRPC server and client libraries to do this automatically.<p>You will want your edge proxy to start the trace for you; this is very easy with Envoy and ... possible ... with nginx and the opentracing plugins.<p>I use structured logs (zap specifically), so I wrote an adaptor that accepts a context.Context for a given request, extracts the trace ID from that (and x-b3-sampled), and logs it with every line.  This means that when I&#x27;m looking at logs, I can easily cut-n-paste the ID into Jaeger to look at the entire request, or if I&#x27;m looking at a trace, type the ID into Kibana and see every log line associated with the request.  (The truly motivated engineer would modify the Jaeger UI to pull logs along with spans since they&#x27;re both stored in ES.  Someday I will do this.)<p>As for log storage and searching, every existing solution is terrible and you will hate it.  I used ELK.  With 4 Amazon-managed m4.large nodes... it still takes forever to search our tiny amount of logs (O(GB&#x2F;day)).  It took me days to figure out how to make fluentd parse zap&#x27;s output properly.  And every time I use Kibana, I curse it as the query language does overly-broad full-text searches, completely ignoring my query and then spending a minute to return all log lines that contain the letter &quot;a&quot; or something.  &quot;kubectl logs xxx | grep whatever&quot; was my go-to searching solution.  Fast and free.<p>If anyone wants to pay me to write a sane log storage and searching system... send me an email ;)"
"Here&#x27;s a helpful tip in case it comes in handy one day:<p>If you need to run Levenshtein Distance over tens of thousands of strings, perhaps as part of a fuzzy search, and you only need to match on distances of 0 or 1, not any distance in general, then there&#x27;s an optimization on Levenshtein Distance where you hard code the function just for distances of 0 or 1.

I also find the drop in testosterone and increase in brain matter really easy to accept. My husband changed after our first was born. Something automatic happened that changed the way he acted towards our baby than he had to other babies and it wasn&#x27;t just the fact it almost killed me.
Lastly, because I&#x27;m overly verbose tonight, sorry, I love that the &quot;fun&quot; dad stereotype actually might be the biologic usual setting. It doesnt mean dad cant be the nurturing one and mom the fun one but it does mean it should come a little more naturally for men, therefore, it is likely to happen in any father, so both roles are covered biologically.
I lied. One more thought, I wonder how this would work in a same sex couple. If one woman gives birth does the other automatically take on the father role biologically? What if they take turns giving birth? Do they get to play noth roles then? What about in men? Does one take on the mom role hormonally? Would this being found to be true remove some of the objections to same sex couples parenting or does science mean nothing to the objectors?"
"I enjoyed reading it, but I wouldn&#x27;t call it a &quot;primer&quot;, since I can hardly think of what else there is to know about Bezier curves! It&#x27;s a rather comprehensive exposition.<p>Here&#x27;s a primer on Bezier curves if you had to program them in 30 minutes. You won&#x27;t need more than this:<p>1. Bezier curves are just taking weighted averages, repeatedly. A weighted average of two points, A and B, is a linear combination <i>P(t) = (1-t)A + tB</i>. As <i>t</i> goes from 0 to 1 with constant speed, <i>P(t)</i> goes from A to B with constant speed.<p>A weighted average like this gives you <i>one</i> point out of <i>two</i>. Now, say you have <i>four</i> points, in order: A1, A2, A3, A4. For a number <i>t</i> between 0 and 1, take weighted averages of consecutive points: A1 and A2, A2 and A3, A3 and A4. That gives you a sequence <i>three</i> points. Repeat this procedure until you have only one point left. That&#x27;s your Bezier curve defined by A1..A4 at time t. This is called a 3rd degree curve, and generalizes to sequences of any length (you can figure out how!).<p>2. The above tells you how to draw this with a computer. Just pick, say, 100 values of <i>t</i> between 0 and 1, and connect the dots with straight lines. That is, you converted a curve into a poly-line, consisting of straight segments. This can be used to compute intersections (just see if any one segment intersects any other), compute tangents (extend any segment to get a tangent at that point), normals (in 2D: rotate a segment by 90 degrees clockwise).<p>3. Most importantly, <i>why</i> you would want to do something like this: Bezier curves are easy for machines to trace, and for humans to understand. Here are some properties of a (cubic) Bezier curve given by points A1, A2, A3, A4:<p>-it starts at A1, and ends at A4<p>-it is tangent to segments A1A2 and A3A4 at endpoints<p>-by moving A2 and A3, it is easy to make a C- and S- shaped curve.<p>Beyond that, things aren&#x27;t as intuitive. This is why <i>all</i> graphics software gives you 3rd degree Bezier curves as a tool: it&#x27;s flexible enough while easy enough.<p>In practice, Bezier curves came to replace the French Curve[1]. The irony is that there is little French about the French curve (nobody even knows why they&#x27;re called that!), but Bezier curves are French through and trough: the two key people behind them, Paul de Casteljau and Pierre Bezier, have spent their entire lives in France, and came up with the curves for manufacturing at Citroen and Renault. Arguably, Bezier curves are the true French curves.<p>4. Bonus. In Photoshop&#x2F;Illustrator&#x2F;etc: the UI for Bezier curves is this: click and drag to define A1 and A2 (A1 is is where you click, A2 is where you release). Consecutive click-drag-releases define three points: e.g. A3 on mouse down, A4 on mouse up, and A5 such that A4 is the midpoint of A3 and A5. The curve you get is a union of cubic Beziers defined by A1..A4, A4..A7, A7..A10, etc.<p>The curve is smooth because the UI forces the tangents to be aligned (unless you do a single click without dragging: this makes 2 tangents of length 0, i.e. a vertex).<p>When drawing curves using this UI, you really are drawing <i>tangents</i> to the curve you want to get: draw _— to get an S, roughly.<p>That&#x27;s it folks!

There was a site on Windows bloat-ware, there were for example programs having multiple version of the same library link into the code even while the program only used one library ever.<p>Also the screen layout is runned thru a layout program&#x2F;library that slows things down, the layout system is great when you are designing the system, but once you reach the point of final and fixed design there are faster ways to display it.<p>on the other hand, management is too often cheap, and says &quot;It works, don&#x27;t it?&quot; and do not want to pay for the extra coding that would make so much faster."

"I&#x27;ve never been a fan of the idea that &quot;the company&#x27;s only purpose to deliver value to its shareholders.&quot;<p>So I&#x27;m glad that they call out additional stakeholders and put customers and employees at the top of the list. Customers who are willing to pay for some useful good or service and employees who are willing to do a good job delivering it also seem like pretty essential ingredients for a successful business.<p>Externalities are a real thing, so I&#x27;m glad they mentioned local communities and the environment.<p>However, there may be external effects on global communities as well. For example, Facebook delivers value to its customers (advertisers) but causes harm to Facebook users.<p>There are also companies that harm their customers directly, in spite of customers paying for the &quot;value&quot; that they deliver."

"The biggest limit is that their &quot;chunking&quot; of data by time-slices may lead directly to the hot partition problem  -- in their case, a &quot;hot chunk.&quot; Most time series is &#x27;dull time&#x27; -- uninteresting time samples of normal stuff.<p>Then, out of nowhere, some &#x27;interesting&#x27; stuff happens.

"When I was a kid, my grandmother brought home a cardboard box with a 4-5 mis-matched  volumes of encyclopedias in it. Always a bookworm, I could read an article about any subject in them and be content for hours.<p>You can imagine my joy when, omewhere around 1991 or 1992, we got a new computer in the library at school. It was a dedicated station for the encyclopedia, and it was even set up in the same location as the printed ones were.<p>My faded memory recalls it being Compton&#x27;s Encyclopedia. It ran on an 286 IBM PS&#x2F;2 (the all-in-one unit), and it had a mouse, external CD-ROM, and a laser printer. The rumor was that it cost $10,000.

"I have been working remotely for 3-4 years, and I am currently job hunting.<p>I did not like working remotely honestly. As an extrovert, I did not like the isolation.

"I&#x27;ve heard stories from others in the industry of companies using tools like this on their <i>human-facing</i> documentation and requiring a certain score from them. Imagine using Microsoft Word&#x27;s spelling and grammar checker, not being able to add or override its decisions (without following an extremely lengthy and bureaucratic process), and being required to have less than X &quot;defects&quot; per 100 words. Naturally, this results in documentation that is perfectly grammatical and free of spelling errors, but verbose, full of unusual phrasing, and next to useless for its actual purpose of informing a human.<p>Grading students&#x27; code using a machine is not such a bad idea in contrast, because in that case there is [1] no exceptions possible in a programming language, [2] the machine (compiler) has to understand it anyway, and [3] it does save time verifying correctness. But communication in a human language really needs to be assessed by humans. Anyone who thinks &quot;AI&quot; can accurately assess human language is either severely delusional, or trying to make $$$ from it."
"Having conducted a reasonable amount of academic and scientific research, this metric is more likely to be mischaracterizing research than revealing any issues. This doesn&#x27;t even establish a causal-link between self-citation and poor research quality, it just assumes it.<p>Most researchers continue to do new research on the same concept after a publication, and they will of course site their earlier work when continuing. Additionally, post-graduate researchers often have their names placed on the research of grad students they are in charge of, even though they often have minimal involvement in the research or conclusions drawn.<p>You might be able tell something from the ratio of other authors from all citations to the number of self-citations, but only if you could eliminate self citations that were not either inclusion by proxy or cases where they are merely continuing research on the same topic with new methodologies.<p>There are already methods for identifying bad research, none of which can be achieved through the use of non-human-assisted data analysis of the authors list of research. The only way to be sure is critical review and 3rd party verification of results with repeated experiments."

"Disappointed that this made it to the front-page of HN. Had it show up in my push feed because it was so popular; quite upset to click it and see the comments in here falling for someone who&#x27;s a crypto scammer:<p>- Redditor for 28 days; first post made to &#x2F;r&#x2F;investing and contained self-promotion for a website that functions as a search engine for stock market fundamentals (post removed by moderators, take a look using <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ceddit.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ceddit.com</a>)<p>- Has made a few, low impression comments across other trading subreddits (&#x2F;r&#x2F;algotrading and &#x2F;r&#x2F;securityanalysis)<p>- Claims to have been a trader at &quot;multiple Tier-1 US banks&quot;  for 7 years but a glance at their LinkedIn shows less than five and a half years (65 months) between two organizations<p>- Claims that they found, analyzed, and reproduced &quot;130+&quot; academic papers in only &quot;7 months&quot;. Even by superhuman standards, the outlook for completing this much work (at high quality) is grim. Here&#x27;s some napkin math:<p>7 months * 30 days = 210 days
16 hours (superhuman) * 210 days = 3,360 hours
3,360 hours &#x2F; 130 papers to reproduce = 25.8hrs per paper<p>These numbers are intentionally rough to show that even if we&#x27;re being generous, the idea that any one person could somehow recreate a full academic paper in less than two 16 hour working days is absurd. Add to this OP&#x27;s claim of spending &quot;weeks trying to reproduce [a paper&#x27;s] results&quot; and it the task becomes even more daunting.<p>This is possibly the biggest red flag of all -- or OP is the world&#x27;s first (and only) 100x developer.<p>- Does not provide any empirical data to back their claims, only provides the name (not a link) of one paper, and when asked in comments to provide more information -- fails to deliver.<p>This post desperately wants to come off as a research article but it&#x27;s missing all the fundamentals to make it so. If OP&#x27;s claims were true, why wouldn&#x27;t they post their raw findings? We could make that argument that there&#x27;s far too much to post, 130 papers would be a good bit of code, but there&#x27;s no reason that OP couldn&#x27;t provide a listing of the papers they &quot;reproduced&quot; at the bare minimum.<p>OP has made extraordinary claims: most if not all &quot;predicting the stock market&quot; papers are fraudulent, but has failed to provide any supporting evidence to back this up beyond their own words. As someone who just analyzed well over a hundred papers and postures themselves as a data scientist, OP should know that citing yourself doesn&#x27;t fly in this scenario.<p>- OP ends their post with the following: &quot;I try to write a bit on medium even though I&#x27;m not a great writer if you wanted to read more from me.&quot;<p>There&#x27;s absolutely nothing wrong with self-promotion, provided you&#x27;re a quality creator and are transparent about what is being promoted. OP is neither of these things.<p>Clicking the Medium.com link will take you to a blog post titled &quot;Crypto Trading Bots · A helpful guide for beginners [2019]&quot;. If you&#x27;re like me, you might assume this is a tutorial related to crypto trading bots. Perhaps information on setting one up, coding one yourself, or an overview of the landscape. It is none of these things.<p>Much of the article explains how cryptocurrency trading bots work -- which is great, but quickly goes down the path of telling the reader that most bots are garbage and won&#x27;t return a profit. Near the end of the post we&#x27;re advised how to choose a viable trading bot and are provided with three questions to ask ourselves:<p>1. What is the professional experience level of the senior leaders of that firm?
2. Are their algorithms widely known and openly available to anyone? 
3. Is their success aligned with your success?<p>Immediately after these questions are the following lines:
&quot;Unfortunately, choosing a trading bot to go with isn’t as trivial as answering these three questions. In my opinion, everything ultimately comes down to people.&quot;<p>What people, you ask? Perhaps someone like OP, who happens to be the founder of a trading bot platform. The post finishes off with a not-so-subtle advert for his company, along with the extraordinary claim that it will &quot;take full responsibility for the profitability of our clients&quot;. According to the OP, all you need to get rolling on his platform is &quot;$1000&quot; and &quot;to press a single button to get the bots started&quot;, never mind that the platform hasn&#x27;t launched and AFAIK there&#x27;s no start button to press.<p>Clicking through to the platform&#x27;s website will bring you to a scroll-jacked landing page full of marketing fluff. Scroll further down (or click the &quot;Get Started&quot; button) and you&#x27;ll see a pricing table with only one option currently available: pre-order a &quot;$145 single fee lifetime license&quot;. Compared to the two unavailable plans, $145 is a steal -- the next plan down would run you $660 ($55*12) a year. Combine this with the &quot;First 90 days profitability or money back guarantee&quot; and the whole damn thing sounds like an incredible deal. But you better act fast because this offer is only available to the &quot;first 1000 members&quot;.<p>OP&#x27;s other trading bot articles aren&#x27;t much better and in my opinion, directly promote his platform.<p>~~~<p>The whole thing sets off numerous alarm bells in my head -- and it should for you too.<p>A trader who worked at &quot;Tier 1 US banks&quot; should know that guaranteeing the profits on your first 1,000 customers is not only ridiculous but so ambiguous as to be useless. Every developer on this site should know that not a single one of us would be remotely capable of maintaining a death-march level working pace for 7 months, launching a (credible) startup, followed by making non-zalgoized Reddit posts lacking any reference to the void.<p>OP isn&#x27;t an OG superhuman developer who worked for a bunch of big banks and learned all the secrets. They&#x27;re a former trader turned wantrepreneur that&#x27;s resorted to dirty tactics to promote their venture. As far as I&#x27;m concerned, and maybe it&#x27;s inflammatory, but OP is a liar. Nothing more."
"Speaking of Turbo Pascal, it was initially created by Anders Hejlsberg. He later was heavily involved in creating Delphi, C# and TypeScript.

Funny how Google paints itself as the somewhat Justice Scalia of web privacy using <i>originalist</i> arguments to make its point. Personally I never been impressed by these constructions and in this case to the extent that it would be rightly interpreted I would be more a <i>living</i> web privacy kind of person anyway. I ultimately think in the web as in the constitution it is disingenuous to think framers would have envisioned at its conception all use cases and especially all potential abuses.

"I just want to share that I&#x27;m finding the practice of Zen meditation in the context of its overall philosophy to be profoundly helpful. I&#x27;ve read a substantial number of books on the subject. Books are only useful as pointers for how to practice; knowledge alone is useless in Zen. You have to practice, period. But the best books <i>are</i> useful as pointers for how to practice. And if anyone here is interested in exploring Zen, the single book that I feel does the best job of giving you what you need to really practice is &quot;Opening the Hand of Thought: Foundations of Zen Buddhist Practice&quot; by Kosho Uchiyama Roshi[1]. &quot;Zen Mind, Beginner&#x27;s Mind&quot; [2] is also a wonderful book, and it&#x27;s where I started. Its poetic manner of expression made me feel there was something there that I needed to explore. But the Uchiyama book just takes the cake for being very clear and down-to-earth, without watering down either the practice or the philosophy. After that it&#x27;s helpful to read commentaries on writings by Dogen. And, ideally, sitting regularly with other folks in a Zen center is extremely helpful. Avoid overly simplistic beginner&#x27;s Zen books. I can&#x27;t recommend them because they seem to distort the essence in an attempt to make it seem as approachable as possible.<p>[1] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Opening-Hand-Thought-Foundations-Buddhist&#x2F;dp&#x2F;0861713575&#x2F;ref=sr_1_1"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Opening-Hand-Thought-Foundations-Budd...</a><p>[2]  <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Zen-Mind-Beginners-Informal-Meditation&#x2F;dp&#x2F;1590308492&#x2F;ref=sr_1_3"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Zen-Mind-Beginners-Informal-Meditatio...</a>"

"Oddly enough, I was just in the process of writing the following in an adjoining window for a blog post:<p>&quot;The modern business corporation is not just an investment vehicle, but is also an integral part of civilization. We spend as much has half our waking hours working within these organizations, tend to find purpose in them and make many of our social relationships through them, so it is not incorrect to consider them social institutions, not unlike school or marriage. As such, corporations are best structured and operated with the wellbeing of all involved stakeholders.<p>One can think of a corporation as being built on three pillars: the investors, the employees and the customers, with employees as the conduit that connect investors and customers. Contrary to the theory of shareholder value maximization, sole focus on the investor does not, on the long run, lead to good outcomes for the investor.&quot;"

"I have been meditating 20 years now (zazen). I do 2-4 hours a day. Several 7 day retreats per year.<p>My starting motivation was  philosophical and academic interest.

And feeling balanced is a good feeling.<p>But there is no way I can justify the amount of time I spend  meditating with any of those.  Meditation teachers say that first you start to work with meditation, then it starts to work with you. The whole view of the world changes.<p>I&#x27;m completely secular humanist but meditation has turned into  spiritual practice. If I worship something, it&#x27;s this moment. Asking why I meditate is like asking why people go surfing. Staying in the moment and balancing on the  wave between the past and the future is not a activity you do for gaining any other goals. Being alive and experiencing the raw existence is something you sacrifice other things  in your life."

Identical copies of my blog went up in several different locations, each with their own copy of ads from the scammers. Some of these blogs ranked higher than mine for certain search terms. Google would eventually catch on and remove them, but it was like playing whack a mole.<p>3. We did not make any money from the RSS feed.

"One of the most memorable moments of my career was when I joined a project and, the very first day, had the equivalent of a “showrunner” sit me and another engineer down and pitch the project to us.<p>It was mostly the same pitch that the showrunner gave to get the green light for the project, and it was crackling with energy, excitement and potential. It was magical.<p>So many other times, I was kind of tossed into a team and had to piece together what we were making and even why and how. This time, though, I went from knowing almost nothing about this project to having a clear view of where we wanted to go and being thrilled to be on this journey.<p>Speaking of which, I can’t resist sharing a fantastic metaphor of a creative project as a journey from Pixar director Andrew Stanton (the following are all his words):<p>The hardest thing about directing an animated movie is keeping yourself excited about it. It&#x27;s hard enough to make the crew excited about it, but keeping yourself excited about it -- trying to remind yourself why you wanted to do it. Because it&#x27;s all about the details once you really start making the movie.<p>It&#x27;s no different than building a house, or, building a really extravagant mansion. There&#x27;s a million details that you have to spend more time with after the bigger ideas of where the rooms are going to go and how it&#x27;s going to be structured, and it can get you kind of bogged down.<p>Joe Ranft used to have this great expression that there&#x27;s always a point during the making of a movie where there&#x27;s sort of the Columbus where-is-the-land moment, where everybody on the boat is going &quot;You promised us the land. Where&#x27;s the land? We&#x27;re not seeing it!&quot;
And people get bogged down in all the minor problems or the major problems that won&#x27;t go away, and it&#x27;s all justified -- it&#x27;s all legitimate to have that response.<p>So, for me, to prevent that is to get really, really picky about what story you&#x27;re going to tell up front. And this is my opinion, and it&#x27;s not a rule. But if I have an idea that I kinda like, then I don&#x27;t want to do it. If I have an idea that affects every fiber of my being, like &quot;I want to see that movie made whether I make it or not&quot; -- it&#x27;s like that idea <i>has</i> to get on the screen -- that&#x27;s a real good quality to start with. Because it&#x27;s going to get attacked for the next four years. And there&#x27;s going to be, sometimes, weeks or months where nothing seems to be going right.<p>[...]
It&#x27;s like looking for oil or something -- it&#x27;s like &quot;where can I find something that has enough fuel that&#x27;s going to keep me going for years?&quot; Because there&#x27;s going to large stretches of time where nothing is working, nobody&#x27;s happy, everybody thinks that the sky is going to fall, and what&#x27;s going to get me out of bed is just because that idea still has to be on the screen.<p>So I want that when I&#x27;m going to go into battle. Because it&#x27;s going to be battle. So if I don&#x27;t have that going in, then I won&#x27;t go into it -- I won&#x27;t make that movie."
"Maybe I&#x27;m dense but if drivers aren&#x27;t finding the expected wage acceptable then why don&#x27;t they simply choose not to offer their services to Uber?  I&#x27;m not saying that in the &quot;cruel capitalist&quot; way, I&#x27;m observing -- they still choose to work, so there must be demand for it at a low wage level.<p>Seems to me we have an oversupply of labor of people willing (or needing) to work for pennies.  Having a minimum wage isn&#x27;t going to improve that. It&#x27;s going to lead to fewer people taking rides, and fewer people being able to become Uber drivers, but slightly better for the ones that can remain drivers.  Classic minimum wage problems.<p>Why don&#x27;t we make it $30 per hour?  or $50?  That would be even better."

"Scheduled tasks are a great way to brown-out your downstream dependencies.<p>In one instance, MDAM RAID checks caused P99 latency spikes first Sunday of every month [0] (default setting).

Thanks u&#x2F;wtarreau<p>Speaking of HAProxy: It fronted a thread-based server processing all sorts of heavy and light queries with segregated thread-pools for various workloads. During peak, proxy would accept connections and queue work faster than the worker threads could handle, and on occasion, the work-queue would grow so big that it not only contained retries of same work scheduled by the desperate clients but a laundry list of work that wasn&#x27;t valid anymore (processed by some other back-end in the retry path, or simply expired as time-to-service exceeded SLA). Yet, there the back-end was, in a quagmire, chugging through never-ending work, in constant overload when ironically the client wasn&#x27;t even waiting on the other end and had long closed the connection.

"To respond to one particular point from the post:<p>&gt; Once you accept bloat, it’s very hard to claw it back. If your project has multi-minute compiles, people won’t even notice a 10s regression in compile time. Then these pile up, and it gets harder and harder to motivate the work to reduce bloat, because each second gained in compile time becomes such a small fraction of the total.<p>This particular problem can be addressed head-on, I think. It would seem feasible to have the compiler to distinguish between the target application (library) and the dependencies. Then it could report the compile times as separate values. This could be built into CI&#x2F;CD tools as a way to catch application level compile time changes.<p>Of course, this approach wouldn’t tell the entire story, but it would likely serve as a canary in the coal mine at least."

To some, it may be irritating to build up that state to do something simple. OTOH, that state is useful if it&#x27;s a cache hit and it&#x27;s annoying to repeatedly pass the same parameters (i.e., you want to repeatedly do a bunch of ops against the same identity you&#x27;ve imported).<p>It&#x27;s usually easier to write a functional core and wrap it in something stateful (by currying the arguments) rather than the trying to do the reverse as the author is doing here."

"&gt; The important thing is that all evolution equations that we know of are time-reversible.<p>I&#x27;ve heard this before, but it&#x27;s so surprising to me, when one of the simplest mathematical operations - addition - is not reversible. e.g. if <i>a+b=4</i>, you can&#x27;t infer the values of <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> (beyond their linear relationship). This non-injectivity is a kind of summarising, with less information, where more than one state maps to one.<p>So &quot;evolution equations&quot; (reality) are not like addition; state changes never summarise."

"So, I&#x27;ve seen the flip side of this. I have a friend who does building inspections for insurance companies. He sees what&#x27;s basically outright fraud all the time, but companies rarely press it. Think about it: their main incentive is to avoid paying out claims where they shouldn&#x27;t have to. They&#x27;re more than happy to deny a claim, stop offering your services to that person and let the next insurance company get defrauded by the person. The companies have minimal incentive to rat out their own clients (especially when they&#x27;re merely 95% sure it&#x27;s fraud), and so lawlessness can easily continue.<p>So, I can see both sides of this. The government might WANT to prosecute insurance fraud, but they&#x27;re rarely aware of it, because how would they find out?"

"Managment just does basic risk assessment: pay a few million here or there for a fine doesn&#x27;t really impact business continuity - so security is not important at all. That&#x27;s the reality.<p>For profit companies are often quite unethical. Laws that put executives in jail if they do not perform basic due diligence might help, e.g. proof a security program is established and executed on, to ensure their own defined standards and policies are met.

"The extra digit names flow well, but I think shoehorning it into the same constructions English decimal numbers use doesn&#x27;t, mostly because the “-ty”&#x2F;“-teen” suffixes are too tied both etymologically and phonetically to being “ten”. If I say the word “eighteen”, making it 0x18 in one context and XVIII in another is close in plausible applicability and far in exact meaning, which is about the worst case for avoiding misunderstandings. In fact I have a vague recollection of my computer architecture instructor back in undergrad warning us about exactly that regarding hexadecimal numbers: do not ever be tempted to pronounce them as though they were decimal, even if all the digits fit into the pattern.<p>There might be ways to fix that with variants of those suffixes, though my first thought of “-xy”&#x2F;“-xeen” might be too hard to distinguish in a noisy auditory environment."

"Micron has been pursuing something similar for a while. The &quot;CPUs&quot; that you can put on the same die, however, are very limited in what they can do, owing to the specific lithography used on memory chips, and the general lack of die space. They also don&#x27;t get uniform access to a huge memory range that you&#x27;d expect from a &quot;real&quot; CPU, and require you to partition work to fit within the constraints of the memory access pattern they can, in fact, support. The instruction set is very limited, floating point can only be emulated (i.e. slow AF, not that you actually need it for neural networks most of the time). The upside is the unlimited memory bandwidth and very low pJ&#x2F;byte, with a few catches.<p>Don&#x27;t know if this is similar, but if it is, it&#x27;s going to be a hard sell, especially in the era when 90% of programmers can&#x27;t even understand what I wrote above."

"This conversation has gone in a completely different direction from the article. We&#x27;re now all complaining about architects instead of the point it&#x27;s trying to make.<p>But you can&#x27;t fix that, so I&#x27;ll chime in.<p>In my opinion, an Architect is just a role that gives advancement opportunities to individual contributors that doesn&#x27;t go down a management path. You&#x27;re still a part of the dev team, and you still do work.<p>When I&#x27;ve been in that role, that&#x27;s how I treat it, and it&#x27;s worked out pretty well. Generally speaking, when the position gets treated that way, I&#x27;d get involved in new products or major changes. For major changes, there&#x27;s a specific thing we&#x27;re targeting that needs something different. An extra complexity or just a different approach. That&#x27;s all I focus on while writing the design document in response to the requirements document. Everything else is fine, but we need to do this one specific thing differently to make it work better. And this will have trickle-down effects on the rest of the system that&#x27;s going to have to accommodate it. If I&#x27;ve done my job well, those are reasonably doable without that much explanation. I&#x27;ll write the prototype that gets at the core of what needs to change, do code review with the team I&#x27;m eventually going to hand it off to, and explain my decisions in person. Once everyone is on the same page and gets what we&#x27;re trying to do, I can hand it off and move on to something else.<p>For new products it&#x27;s a little different. We want to make sure that we learn from our past wherever we can. Companies often have themes to their products and even a completely greenfield project isn&#x27;t totally different from other stuff you&#x27;ve done. There&#x27;s lots of stuff floating around that isn&#x27;t great, but it&#x27;s not so bad that you&#x27;re ready to invest in a &quot;major change.&quot; But if you had to do it all over again, you would do it differently.<p>That&#x27;s what you want to make sure you capture when you start a new project. So again, there&#x27;s requirements. And again, I write a tech document that represents my interpretation of the specs as it applies to the systems in play. The vast majority of these don&#x27;t really matter, and any competent developers on the team can handle them. So my input is to focus on the things that are non-obvious and caused problems for us in the past. But the end result is the same: I write the prototype, workshop it with the team that&#x27;s going to be taking it over, and hand it off and move on when everyone is confident that we all know what needs to be done.<p>Sometimes, it&#x27;s not either of those things. Sometimes there&#x27;s just a really annoying bug that needs tracking down and is really hard. It might not even be caused by the system your team is working on. You might need some cross-team investigation to figure it out. Sometimes you need a wider knowledge than a specialized team has. And sometimes it&#x27;s just because some shit is broken that you wrote 6 years ago, and no one noticed until now because no one used it quite this way back then, but now everyone uses it that way, and it&#x27;s awful, and half the reason you got promoted to architect is because that solution was mindblowing and novel, but now it sucks because no one knows how it works. Not even you. So it&#x27;s your problem, genius, so go fix it. And you go crawl in a hole of shame.<p>Architect as anything other than really super double senior engineer doesn&#x27;t make sense to me. Architect as an outside hire doesn&#x27;t make a ton of sense to me. Architect as a layer of management that&#x27;s not engaged in building software doesn&#x27;t make any sense to me at all.<p>Architect makes sense as a retention strategy. It makes sense as an upward path for ICs. Architects should mentor.
Architect shouldn&#x27;t be a special title. It should be a normal result of doing solid work over time by a person who wants to keep doing solid work instead of switching to management track just to justify a raise&#x2F;promotion.<p>Just my thoughts."
"From &quot;Debt, The First 5000 years&quot;:<p>L. Frank Baum’s book The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, which appeared in 1900, is widely recognized to be a parable for the Populist campaign of William Jennings Bryan, who twice ran for president on the Free Silver platform – vowing to replace the gold standard with a bimetallic system that would allow the free creation of silver money alongside gold. … [O]ne of the main constituencies for the movement was debtors: particularly, Midwestern farm families such as Dorothy’s, who had been facing a massive wave of foreclosures during the severe recession of the 1890s. According to the Populist reading, the Wicked Witches of the East and West represent the East and West Coast bankers (promoters of and benefactors from the tight money supply), the Scarecrow represented the farmers (who didn’t have the brains to avoid the debt trap), the Tin Woodsman [sic] was the industrial proletariat (who didn’t have the heart to act in solidarity with the farmers), the Cowardly Lion represented the political class (who didn’t have the courage to intervene). The yellow brick road, silver slippers, emerald city, and hapless Wizard presumably speak for themselves. “Oz” is of course the standard abbreviation for “ounce.”"

That means it&#x27;s almost 21 years old and just 1 year off warranty.  It&#x27;s been switched on for most of those 21 years but still works great and has never been serviced.  Even more surprisingly, it&#x27;s not obsolete.

But I augment that with domains I find by regularly auditing specific websites that are particularly aggressive with ads and specifically trackers.<p>But with that said, since I&#x27;ve got friends, family and paying users working from that list, I do actively try to prevent the breaking of popular sites and services. For example, personally I&#x27;d outright block anything related to Facebook since I quit them years ago, but too many people still use it, so for my list I try to keep a good balance by blocking their pixel and stuff like that, while allowing the resources absolutely necessary for the site."

The author obviously talks about why that doesn&#x27;t work when you&#x27;re using freelancers, but I wonder if the style could happen not in the art directly, but in a shader or similar. This would also help the art feel more consistent.<p>I do wonder if the author could retain freelancers better, whether that&#x27;s by a contract that gives them a minimum promised hours or a better rate, etc.<p>I definitely think that the insults the author has endured are inappropriate, most certainly the threats are.

If you work on the custom development side you&#x27;ll see a lot more successful businesses run on Shopify.<p>I don&#x27;t see the churn rate as a big problem for Shopify. Their revenue is pretty tied into the customer&#x27;s revenue and expenses, not the amount of unique subscriptions. On top of subscription revenue, they have credit card processing and shipping labels which would be higher than the subscription cost for shops with high revenue.<p>IMO I don&#x27;t really see Shopify and Amazon as really being in the same space unless Amazon makes a real push into curation and I think that would require a radical change in how Amazon works with sellers.

"The paper notes another, distinct, attack possibility:<p>&gt; Before going to this, we mention quickly another mistake in the design that could in itself have led to devastating attacks. The generators that are given in public- key.json are generators of the whole multiplicative group. However, due to the Chinese remainder theorem, it is a good practice to use a generator of prime order. In the present case, the generators will have their order divisible by 2, and therefore there is a huge risk that one bit of information leaks from a ciphertext. In a context like e-voting where a ballot can have a very simple form, this bit of information could reveal a lot of the vote (or even all of it in the case of a yes&#x2F;no question). In principle, we would have had to investigate more in this direction. But due to the main attack that is much easier and far more powerful, we keep this as a remark.<p><a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;1908.05127.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;1908.05127.pdf</a><p>This still leaves the question why the developer(s) decided to roll his&#x2F;her own crypto in this way:<p>&gt; A possible explanation is a confusion with the key size that can be used when using elliptic curves for which the Number Field Sieve algorithm does not apply.<p>This is such an obvious mistake that the entire protocol (whether or not it&#x27;s ever documented) might be vulnerable.<p>&gt; Another less excusable but still possible explanation might be related to the use of the Ethereum blockchain. In the Solidity programming language that is used to write smart contracts, the bit size of the largest supported integers is 256. Maybe the authors did not want to write a multiprecision arithmetic library that would have been required to deal with larger key sizes. This hypothesis is supported by frequent tests in the source code, checking that the big integers they manipulate are not bigger than SOLIDITY_MAX_INT.<p>This seems more likely. However, that last sentence checking for overflow sounds like another trove of vulnerabilities.<p>Moreover, the claim by the developer in the ZDnet article that a patch is forthcoming seems suspect given that it will need to also include multiprecision arithmetic functionality, where there are still more opportunities for snafu."
"Good that they are taking action, however blacklisting that specific CA cert seems like a hacky band aid fix. This is going to end in a cat and mouse game and again shows how broken the whole CA system really is. What I whish they would do is block all “enterprise” CAs and restrict verification chains to end in a list of a few white listed CAs. I understand how disruptive this would be, but in the end it would result in better security for everyone. There are no legitimate reasons for breaking end to end encryption in my opinion."

"Parking minimums are a big problem.  But, it&#x27;s just a part of a much bigger problem: Regulation is strangling the life out of us.  Regulation like zoning and countless other regs prevents market forces from working the way they should.<p>Have you ever heard of a banana shortage crisis or a jeans shortage crisis in the US?  No you haven&#x27;t.  The reason is because market forces are able to adjust to changes in market demand.  In housing, those market forces are bottled up and stifled, preventing investments, preventing innovation, preventing progress, preventing better solutions.  We really really need to start looking at regulations and find ways to get rid of the ones causing all these problems.<p>ADDED:
We&#x27;ve seen very little actual VC money or Research and development go into improving the cost of creating Shelter (In fact, we haven&#x27;t made any improvements in this in the last 50 to 100 years adjusted for inflation).  Much of this is due to regulations.  Other industries can find ways to reduce cost but the mountain of housing regulations prevent any and all progress in these areas.

"I really don&#x27;t understand the negativity on HN towards WeWork.<p>In principle, how it is different than AirBnB or Uber in regard of being a tech company? It&#x27;s not like Uber or AirBnB&#x27;s core compentancies are tech, I&#x27;m sure WeWork can also build a dev team making frameworks and research that some day might be used in their core business.<p>The article argues that the difference is that Uber, AirBnB, Yelp, Twitter is a tech company because they have &quot;scalable virtual models that can be exponentially magnified overnight with little additional costs&quot; but this seems to bu untrue since they did not took over the world. Maybe they are just humble but I think it&#x27;s simply that their business model is &quot;low touch high scale&quot; and this is being mistaken with Microsoft&#x27;s ability to develop technology and sell it infinite times with at no addditional cost per copy.<p>What stops WeWork from embracing the Uber model?  Maybe you have an empty flat, you can turn it into WeWork location by furnishing the place according to the WeWork standarts and install some kind of kiosk and smart lock system. Uber makes the driver to use cars that obey certain standarts, why wouldn&#x27;t WeWork do the same and &quot;scale overnight&quot;?"

"Remote work can be great, but it requires two key things. First is the ability to actually do useful work at home or other non-office location. This is not hard (I suspect some people working remotely do goof off, but I suspect those people are not super useful sitting in the office either).<p>Second, much harder, is the employer support. Direct manager of remote workers should know how to manage them (which is a rare skill) and be interested in doing it. It means parceling work in a larger, independent chunks, planning integration and communication as needed and spotting and resolving problems early enough with no&#x2F;rare face to face contact (and face to face <i>does</i> help for this).<p>Fail either of those and working remotely is inviting failure.

"I actually prefer working at home in the morning and coming in to the office only in the afternoon.  As a software developer, it allows me to focus on my software development and finish the tickets in my sprint without being stopped by support requests, wishlist feature requests, and other distractions from co-workers.<p>When someone has to put a request in writing on Slack or with an email instead of just going to my cubicle and bugging me, it makes it less likely they will bother me with stuff that is not important.<p>In terms of a daily standup, they work just as well using a video conference call, or, better yet, as a written report posted to Slack every day."

There are plenty out there already so it shouldn&#x27;t be difficult.
"A hypothetical situation;<p>An amendment is proposed on the floor of the House to change the formula in a bill for how funding is allocated.<p>The amendment presents a pro-urban allocation which provides a greater share of funding for larger cities compared to a baseline per-capita allocation.<p>Urban center representatives stand up and argue how their cities need a higher reimbursement rate because the issue at hand is costlier to fix or more prevalent in their environment.<p>Rural representatives stand up and argue they need the baseline funding to run an effective program.<p>A vote is taken, and 54% of votes approve the amendment, urban center reps effectively pooling their votes to enact the funding paradigm that most benefited their constituents.<p>——<p>The moral of the story is that it’s a lot more complicated than 1 person 1 vote.<p>Often times policies may benefit a rural area over and urban environment or vice versa. One type of community benefiting and the expense of another. Cities already carry a massive voting advantage, because, that’s where most people live!<p>When bills pass on a majority vote, urban already wins over rural every time. The rural areas maybe can form blocks to help push otherwise divided city reps one way or another, but policy debate is already dominated by urban voters, despite the claim of urban votes “counting less”. The simple math belies the reality that urban center reps vote for pro-urban national policies and the rural states with 1 rep sit on the sidelines.<p>The last place these votes matter, even in the slightest, is in the EC in a closely contested election, and in the Senate. Frankly I’m not convinced more populism is any benefit, or that cities are particularly hurting from a lack of representation."

"I ran a website that I first coded when I was 14-15, then kept improving over the years. It was for amateur electronic music producers to upload their tracks and after a few years there were several thousand active users, generating ~$400&#x2F;month in AdSense.<p>One day a relatively famous DJ tweeted a link to a song on the website, and that day alone generated close to $300, so 19 year old me thought he was about to earn his first $1000 in one month from a website! But Google decided to block the account because I guess that spike in traffic was too much, even though it all came from Twitter...<p>So suddenly I was left with this website I had invested hundreds of hours in, and no way to monetise it.

"&gt; The Readline API is much more extensive than that single function of course, and anyone using it can tweak all sorts of things about the library’s behavior. Library users can even add new functions that end users can configure via ~&#x2F;.inputrc, meaning that Readline is very easy to extend. But, as far as I can tell, even Bash ultimately calls the simple readline() function to get input just as in the example above, though there is a lot of configuration beforehand.<p>I feel that was designed backwards. Instead of having facilities so applications can extend readline by adding their own line editing functions specific to them, it should have facilities so users can add their own extensions and make them applicable to all applications that use readline. That would be cool.<p>In particular, I would like to be able to extend it to add better multi-line editing support like what zsh&#x27;s zle has.<p>In zle, I can use `o` and `O` to create lines below or above the cursor, `j` and `k` to move to the next or previous line, `&gt;&gt;` to further indent the current line, etc. It&#x27;s basically a mini-version of a vi buffer, right in the command line.<p>In readline, you can insert a newline in the current prompt with Ctrl-V Ctrl-J, but to move between the lines, I have to move left or right beyond the beginning or end of the current line.<p>Even worse, readline&#x27;s history format doesn&#x27;t support having a single entry for multi-line commands, like zsh does. :("

"1. Even if NPV is a good idea, this is the wrong way to do it. Doing it the wrong way means legal chaos. Doing it the wrong way means it can probably be undone or made worse the wrong way.<p>2.

I don&#x27;t think the results will match the intentions.<p>For point 1 this seems like parts of Obamacare. Whether you support it or not, enforcing&#x2F;creating parts of it via executive order means it can be unenforced&#x2F;dismantled via executive order. This isn&#x27;t a direct comparison, my point, if you base something on legally weak and questionable methods you will end up with weak and questionable outcomes.<p>Another way I look at point 2, can Justin Beiber rewrite Mozart and improve upon it? There are very few political intellectuals I would put on par with the founding fathers, and sadly most of those are not politicians. The founders&#x27; system has worked very well for centuries, the USofA has faults sure, but from ragtag rebel colonies to world super-power, this part is working fine. We have many problems, isolate the variables, I don&#x27;t think the EC is the cause.<p>Point 3, this is mostly a party issue, Democrats support it, Republicans do not. Of the 16 states to pass it through legislature 15 had Democrat governors, the single Republican governor vetoed. I think it is safe to say the elections of Bush and Trump, without winning the popular vote, are the big driving factors for the NPV. I don&#x27;t think NPV will have the intended effect. I think people are wrongly taking new rules and applying old stats but if you change the rules of the game you can&#x27;t expect players (candidates and voters) to play with old strategies. A lot more Republicans will show up to vote in solidly blue states where currently voting for an R is a waste of time."

"I hold no love for parking minimums, and would love to see them abolished, but proposals like &quot;we should turn 10% of all current parking spaces into low-income housing&quot; just make me roll eyes.<p>That&#x27;s not an actionable proposal, the closest that gets to an actionable proposal is to demolish existing parking structures and either put public housing projects on top of them or incentivize real estate developers to build actual low-income housing.<p>Telling real estate developers to build low-income housing in areas where they could easily build high-income housing is, well, let&#x27;s just say cities promise this all the time and developers never do it.<p>&quot;Build more housing&quot; is probably the answer to the homeless problem, but the ownership issue needs to be fixed first. The author made all these cute graphics of studio apartments superimposed on parking spaces. Cool, I like density, my condo is 650 sqft, like 3 or 4 spaces without egress.<p>Are we talking about literally taking parking from existing owners and building housing on the bare pads? Are we talking about building vertically on top of them and leaving the space underneath for cars? I&#x27;m not saying these are bad ideas. But can we fully bake them first? So a politician can actually hand it to a bunch of legislators and come up with something he can actually put on his platform?<p>Sure let&#x27;s abolish the minimum. But that won&#x27;t do a darned thing to help congestion and the housing shortage other than make LA more like Atlanta where there&#x27;s an island of density around a bunch of ugly sprawl with more dense pockets springing up in the periphery. We&#x27;re still waiting for market conditions to fix the city. And market forces don&#x27;t care about what we want.

Or perhaps Rust had one or two benefits that assisted in the development of Nu. But you don&#x27;t word it that way or go into any details as to what made Rust special&#x2F;better than X, Y or Z language (not that you need to, but if you&#x27;re going to make a wild statement, you should be prepared to back it up). The only 3 points made following that were about features that have widely existed in other languages well before Rust came along: async&#x2F;await, async streams, and serde.<p>Rust is cool and is still exploring some really great ideas in making programs safer and more maintainable.

(These changes progress over years)<p>People placed into situations of total sensory deprivation very often see their conscious self dissolve into &#x27;hallucinations&#x27; across all their senses.<p>Quadriplegics that acquire their paralysis from disease or accident suffer psychological and emotional changes which are more substantial than would be expected from the injuries alone  (I was never clear on how exactly this was distinguished, so take it with a grain of salt).<p>I have never understood why people who talk of &#x27;uploading their consciousness&#x27; or just creating a human-like consciousness in a computer would assume that the simulated consciousness would function markedly different from, in the best case, a person experiencing profound sensory deprivation.  Consciousness can not be sustained if the feedback loop of the body, perception, and environment is broken.  Consciousness is an emergent property of a feedback loop.  If there&#x27;s no feedback loop, the property doesn&#x27;t emerge.<p>Watching the Netflix &#x27;More Human Than Human&#x27; documentary, one of the people featured commented when comparing Siri and the AI in the movie Her that systems only need to become &#x27;a little more sophisticated&#x27; to reach that level.  That is a big problem.  It&#x27;s not &#x27;a little more sophisticated&#x27; at all.  It requires emotions, and the vast majority of people do not even know what emotions are.  I&#x27;ll spoil it for you.  Emotions are a trained response, the product of neurological feedback to the response of prediction operating on primarily internal perception.  Often the relation of moving from one topic to another in a conversation is not based upon the subject matter of the text.  It is based upon shared cultural experiences garnered over a lifetime and similarities in the emotions evoked by certain things.<p>Even pursuing the goal of creating a &#x27;truly intelligent machine&#x27; is dangerous, philosophically speaking.  What happens when we create a bot that does antisocial things?  We shit it down.  We scrap the project.  We saw that with Tay by Microsoft.  This is dangerous.  It is clear that once we DO produce a human-like intelligence... it will be better than us.  It won&#x27;t have any of the rough edges or not-safe-for-work parts.  At everything we value about human beings, it will top us.  We can look at history to see how humanity responds when something which was previously seen as &#x27;fundamentally human&#x27; is taken out of our quiver.  It is not pretty.  The folk legend of John Henry shows that the man who is willing to kill himself to be better than a machine is not an idiot - he is a hero to motivate the masses.  I don&#x27;t think it is a stretch to imagine a future when humanities worst qualities become what we see as virtue because AI &#x27;can&#x27;t&#x27; do it.  A robot can&#x27;t hate.  It can&#x27;t be violent, bigoted, angry, etc.  When that is the only thing humanity has left that defines them as &#x27;more&#x27; than the world... why should we be sure they won&#x27;t come to see that as their virtue?  We have already seen all of those things valued as virtue in our history when similar pressures weren&#x27;t even at play.<p>Then there&#x27;s the more unknown approach.  A machine-based intelligence which is not given a body.  That&#x27;s really the big question mark.  We can be confident, very confident, that it will not be recognizably human in any way, shape, or form.  Most of our attributes as humans are derived directly or indirectly from the biological facts of our existence.  An organism sharing none of those things will share none of those attributes.  And it will be weird in surprising ways.  I don&#x27;t think there is any reasonable danger of such an intelligence &quot;taking over the world&quot; in any substantial way.  All conflict is rooted in resource contention.  And we have nothing that such an intelligence would want or could use.  If it wants energy, the only real resource we would share a need for, it would be best off launching itself into space and sitting in orbit with a bunch of solar panels.  We don&#x27;t have any idea what a singular intelligence, one with no concept of &quot;individual&quot; because there is only one of them, would be like.  One which has no inherent mortality.  One which does not deal with disease.  One which has no concept of family.  One which has no sense of age.  These are things which define us and make us human, and it will lack all of them.  It would probably be a great challenge to convince such an intelligence that we existed, that we were real, that we could communicate with it, and get it to want to.  It could simply conclude that it will wait for 10,000 years and hope we are extinct by then."
I think this is all missing the real issue by a mile: greater density would change the city. Those who don&#x27;t want that have enough power to stop it. Prices start dropping the day after tech companies realize there are other cities that would love to have them.

"I promise I&#x27;m not trying to be flippant, but is this still actively around? I see there have been two seemingly-minor releases this year, the first project activity since 2017.<p>I had insomnia a few weeks ago and was re-reading a bunch of &quot;whatever happened to OLPC&quot; stuff to remember that utter disaster, and AFAIK, the Sugar project is basically just a few people, its now under the auspices of the SFC and its really barebones with almost no hardware support (the last OLPC devices were sold years ago). Even the base image of Ubuntu it offers for the USB stick reached EOL more than 18 months ago.<p>We can all say this was a nice idea -- but this certainly isn&#x27;t an active project in the sense that there is developer or monetary investment."
"Let&#x27;s say an event occurs and you know a particular stock will go up 20% but you pump enough money into the stock to make the stock go 30% and then you let others chase the stock and publish news about this market move through media houses &#x2F; content spamming &#x2F; fake accounts. Then you short the stock once you get the desired movement and finally you remove the money from this stock so it goes into free fall and all people start selling. Finally, you close the short position when you notice there is no room for stock going further down. Now let&#x27;s say stock ended up at 10% so you buy more stock so it goes 15% just below what you initially predicted.<p>Assuming you&#x27;ve billions to move the stock.<p>Why such strategy will not work?"
"So, a continuation of the same &quot;construction of the sake of the appearance of growth&quot; phenomena that we saw with ghost cities?"
"Blender, despite its &quot;odd&quot; UI, is the best open source GUI software out there. I don&#x27;t use any other GUI open source software -- I pay for Microsoft Office and Adobe Applications -- but I find Blender to be useful, productive, and complete. It&#x27;s solid, and has a very good community. Unlike other open source &quot;alternatives&quot; to commercial software (like, say Gimp or Open Office), it&#x27;s actually _better_ in many ways, and not just FUD or useful to casual users."
Probably the most compelling feature of Blender being open source with a significant community is that it&#x27;s the one 3d tool that Autodesk can&#x27;t simply buy out.

"Lots of hate in this thread..
People asking for proof: what sort of evidence would convince you? I take these blog posts, apply it to my experience, and take what I think makes sense. Sometimes, an idea will solve an obvious pain I&#x27;ve had. Sometimes, an idea will show me a pain I didn&#x27;t know I have. Sometimes I disagree with the idea because it won&#x27;t work for me. That&#x27;s fine. I&#x27;m still much better off thanks to this literature, and I would be worse off if it all had to be evidence-based.<p>If you think you can write better based on your experience, please go for it. I&#x27;d love to have more literature to read, analyze, and learn from. If you can&#x27;t (pressed for time, etc), and only have time to post in HN comment threads, then at least discuss concretely which parts you disagree with so we can learn from that too (I&#x27;m serious, not being facetious). If you can&#x27;t even do THAT, then sorry, all your valuable experience is way less useful than someone like Martin Fowler, because I&#x27;m not learning anything from you.<p>Having a good understanding of how to architect code is hard. Being able to write about that in a way that&#x27;s useful for others is even harder, and is a skill of its own.<p>So personally, I thank Martin &amp; Co for all their writing."

"Again: There really needs to be a warning (elevate-able to an error like usual) for all removed &#x2F; &quot;optimized out&quot; code.

"This is really interesting, but note the power increase seen inside the DRAM modules.<p>Anandtech have an excellent analysis: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.anandtech.com&#x2F;show&#x2F;14750&#x2F;hot-chips-31-analysis-inmemory-processing-by-upmem"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.anandtech.com&#x2F;show&#x2F;14750&#x2F;hot-chips-31-analysis-i...</a><p>&gt; The operation itself [inside the dram module] actually requires 2x the power (20 pJ compared to 10 pJ [inside the main CPU]), but the overall gain in power efficiency is 170 pJ vs 3010 pJ, or just under 20x<p>&gt; One thing that this slide states that might be confusing is the server power consumption – the regular server is listed as only 300W, but the PIM solution is up to 700W. This is because the power-per-DRAM module would increase under UPMEM’s solution.<p>I&#x27;m assuming that those numbers represent &quot;peak&quot; power, and that when idle the compute parts of the DRAM can be power&#x2F;clock gated. The implication being that if you are doing lots of in-memory analytics, you&#x27;ll get a power saving, but if you switch to &quot;something else&quot; and don&#x27;t get good utilisation of the in-memory compute, you&#x27;ll probably ruin your power&#x2F;energy efficiency.<p>I guess that means the future improvements will involve bringing the power consumption of the modified DRAM modules back in line with their &quot;normal&quot; cousins."
"As a non-expert in the specific industry, but a tech person who reads S-1s with interest, I like the look of Cloudflare. It is providing a global infrastructure product and clearly building something that other companies will use and integrate in way that makes it sticky to leave.<p>I can&#x27;t remember who said it, but I definitely subscribe to the idea that cloud providers are essentially a tax on businesses that use the internet to drive their business.That makes CF attractive.<p>My feeling is that the risk that will affect it in the long run are macro: global downturns, over reliance on a specific sector, regulation, freezing out of markets due to unfair competition from local players and spikes in energy costs (curious why this wasn&#x27;t mentioned in the S-1 specifically)<p>They also have no outlined plan for the capital they will raise, this may be a good sign, no bold bets, just keep the marketing spend going and achieve greater scale.<p>It&#x27;s getting harder and harder to judge if something is a good bet these days. Nobody is actually making a profit, the dual stock structure is troublesome, and the access to capital feels too easy. Ir frustrates me that it&#x27;s impossible (for a mere mortal with €500 a year to invest) to get in at an early stage when you can watch the value rise and feel a connection with the company."

"Though I have no complaints about the way they went about implementing it (open standards hooray!), as a mail client author and someone with lots of experience with mail in general - I&#x27;m NACK to JMAP. I think that it comes with some questionable design decisions (HTTP? JSON?) which on their face I imagine look fine to the typical HNer, but in many ways is a regression from IMAP. I would prefer to see the limitations of IMAP addressed with a few carefully written extensions to the spec - which is already extensible and has a thriving set of useful extensions in the wild.<p>By no means is IMAP a particularly good protocol, but it is extremely broadly supported and designed more with email in mind than JMAP appears to be, which seems to focus more on bringing shiny web tech to email regardless of its utility in such a context. It&#x27;s also one of many closely interlinked mail-related specifications, and JMAP fails to integrate well with many related specs imo."

"Reviews aren&#x27;t bad, but they don&#x27;t necessarily stop bad apps, and they slow down good ones.<p>The worse part of approval delays is that they are almost never given time in development schedules made by project managers, bizdevs, marketing etc.  They just absorb that few days into the dev time or take from testing etc.<p>In a way, having long app reviews, or delays to update, causes worse quality apps from having dev days or testing days taken from the app development cycle and rushed fixes just to get it back in the pipeline. This is a very common occurrence in app&#x2F;game development. I wish it weren&#x27;t this way but quality has to be fought for and it can harm the people pushing for it perceptually as &#x27;slow&#x27;.<p>Basic heuristics on release for bad actors is enough, then upon launch have random reviews that check out what people are doing past the point.

"This is an interesting article but there&#x27;s a dichotomy here that isn&#x27;t discussed that I think is important. Part of the appeal of an API gateway is that it facilitates bolting on solutions to a ton of common crosscutting concerns that show up between external-to-internal callers. Purely internal-internal system communication isn&#x27;t quite the same and the set of concerns that affects each is different. Authentication and authorization are not necessarily concerns for system internal calls, for instance, neither is endpoint stability (at least, not in the same way). This article blurs the line between the two."
"The stock market is a complex adaptive system where the agents are constantly changing their strategies so that even if you were to find inefficiencies or patterns, they are only ephemeral."
"One of the principles the article highlights is that additional features make a software complex and therefore more likely to fail. This is true, but I&#x27;d argue it&#x27;s not for the reason the article claims.<p>The claim is:<p>&gt; Stakeholders who want to increase the priority for a feature have to also consider what features they are willing to deprioritise. Teams can start on the most critical objectives, working their way down the list as time and resources allow.<p>In other words, the argument is &quot;competing priorities in a large-scale project make it more likely to fail, <i>because stakeholders can&#x27;t figure out which ones to do first</i>.&quot; Actually, in this very paragraph, the author glosses over the real issue: <i>&quot;Teams can start on the most critical objectives, working their way down the list&quot;</i> - treating development as an assembly line input-to-output process.<p>I argue that it&#x27;s not time constraints that complex programs bad, but instead the mere act of thinking that throwing more developers at the work will make it any better. Treating the application as a &quot;todo list&quot; rather than a clockwork of engineering makes a huge difference in the quality of the work. When developers are given a list of customer-facing features to achieve, more often than not the code winds up a giant ball of if-statements and special cases.<p>So yes, I do agree that complex software is worse and more prone to failure than simple software - but not for the reason that there&#x27;s &quot;too much to do&quot; or that prioritizing is hard. Complex software sucks because it&#x27;s requirement-driven, instead of crafted by loving hands. No one takes the time to understand the rest of the team&#x27;s architecture or frameworks when just throwing in another special case takes a tenth of the time."

The pipe should support two or three formats to start with (csv, json, and maybe xml, so you can handle both tabular and child-parent relations with a varying degree of precision) and shells could have a special character for piping stddata (I like ¥) so everything else about them would stay the same."

"I think having lots of data points is the only way to give proper advice about Startups.

Though this was never my intent, over the years we&#x27;ve collected so many datapoints that alongside our design work we tend to advice and steer the companies we work with into directions we think the company should go. All backed by real examples from previous experiences. Being in positions where you work with a lot of companies over a longer period of time, I think, is the best way form thoughtful startup advice."

"I don&#x27;t see anything changing as long as short-term decision-making is incentivized. Executive shares should vest according to some multiple of the average tenure of a company in the S&amp;P 500. If the multiple is 1, that means you need to beat the average to own a share of a company you manage. Tying it to the market average calibrates this schedule to the pace of company turnover due to external factors, such as population growth, technological change, etc. I&#x27;m not proposing a legal framework beyond requiring that these norms be promulgated and individual companies required to report the terms of share grants to management.

and the original one was moved to an unrelated project.  It is simply
impossible to choose generic names that remain appropriate for very
long.</i><p><i>Of course, they could have called the second one &quot;shop2&quot; and so on.
But then one is really only distinguishing machines by their number.
You might as well just call them &quot;1&quot;, &quot;2&quot;, and &quot;3&quot;.  The only time
this kind of naming scheme is appropriate is when you have a lot of
machines and there are no reasons for any human to distinguish between
them.  For example, a master computer might be controlling an array of
one hundred computers.  In this case, it makes sense to refer to them
with the array indices.</i><p><i>While computers aren&#x27;t quite analogous to people, their names are.
Nobody expects to learn much about a person by their name.  Just
because a person is named &quot;Don&quot; doesn&#x27;t mean he is the ruler of the
world (despite what the &quot;Choosing a Name for your Baby&quot; books say).
In reality, names are just arbitrary tags.  You cannot tell what a
person does for a living, what their hobbies are, and so on.</i><p>1. <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tools.ietf.org&#x2F;html&#x2F;rfc1178#page-2"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tools.ietf.org&#x2F;html&#x2F;rfc1178#page-2</a>"
"I noticed that the people who interview a lot don’t really get anything in return; in our quarterly engineering org meetings or whatever there’s a slide thanking the people who interviewed most. I’ve never gotten a thanks when I interviewed more than other times, nor any other indication that this is something my manager values. (And what your manager values is kind of everything, in my experience.)<p>So I almost never volunteer when they need someone to cover, don’t try to put more effort into it than necessary, and have blocks in my calendar so they don’t try to schedule when I don’t want them. It may be crucial for the company (and ethically, you owe it to candidates to treat them fairly) but it’s not treated like something they value.<p>For what it’s worth, I somehow slipped through the cracks and didn’t have to interview for quite a long time after I started.

&gt; Nobody tells this to people who are beginners, I wish someone told me. All of us who do creative work, we get into it because we have good taste. But there is this gap. For the first couple years you make stuff, it’s just not that good. It’s trying to be good, it has potential, but it’s not. But your taste, the thing that got you into the game, is still killer. And your taste is why your work disappoints you. A lot of people never get past this phase, they quit. Most people I know who do interesting, creative work went through years of this. We know our work doesn’t have this special thing that we want it to have. We all go through this. And if you are just starting out or you are still in this phase, you gotta know its normal and the most important thing you can do is do a lot of work. Put yourself on a deadline so that every week you will finish one story. It is only by going through a volume of work that you will close that gap, and your work will be as good as your ambitions. And I took longer to figure out how to do this than anyone I’ve ever met. It’s gonna take awhile. It’s normal to take awhile. You’ve just gotta fight your way through.

"The reliance on documents is interesting. If you are having to ask for proof that someone has passed an exam or obtained a qualification then you have already gone wrong to some extent.
Most people never show school or university result certificates ever during their working lives.<p>Just a name, accent and visual cues are enough if you are white with English as first language. People might ask for paperwork as a formality but the job is going to be yours if recruitment is difficult and there aren&#x27;t any other applicants.

"The key difference between `const` and the `register` and `inline` keywords is that, despite all of them often flagging optimisations that the compiler can often work out anyway, `const` still aids human comprehension by declaring constraints, whereas the latter two do not.<p>It seems that interprocedure optimisations in modern compilers make a lot of const-by-reference optimisations apply even when the code is mutable-by-reference in the parameter list but the function body doesn&#x27;t modify it in practice. This would only work if it could deterministically work out which function is called.<p>Local constant stack values surely can be completely deterministically verified as such by the optimiser even without the `const` modifier. They could be overwritten without a C assignment to it, via the stack from a buffer overflow of an array next to it, but that&#x27;s undefined behaviour so a compiler is presumably free to assume it is not modified, eliminate unnecessary register&#x2F;memory loading code, and let the developers deal with the consequences.<p>As trailing `const` on member functions outlaws modifications via `this`, it would follow that the same optimisation-even-without-modifier process would apply as to `const` local stack values.<p>As constancy is a constraint that aids human comprehension, there&#x27;s a good reason for choosing a keyword just as short as the mutable equivalent, such as Swift&#x27;s `let` vs `var`; if the more constrained equivalent is equally or more convenient, more constrained and thus easy-to-reason-about code becomes more common."

"For those who are curious, the building age data comes from the Dutch government (as others already said). It was imported into OpenStreetMap about 5 years ago by a few dozen volunteers including myself.<p>The data contains addresses and buildings (outline, building started date, and an identifier to make updates easier). This means we removed all existing buildings and addresses in the country, which felt really risky, but because the import was done manually and only tool-assisted, it seems we managed to get it right. Took a few months, but once enough volunteers hopped on, it went quite fast. If I remember correctly, once you got the hang of it (your third import or so), an average municipality took about 2 hours (we have 350 municipalities).<p>For the Dutch speakers among us, more info about the project can be found here: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.openstreetmap.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;NL:BAG"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.openstreetmap.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;NL:BAG</a><p>I am not sure where Mapbox&#x27; height data comes from. In OSM, you can give a &quot;levels&quot; tag to indicate how many levels a building has (from which the height can be estimated), or a height tag in meters if it is known, but the buildings don&#x27;t have that. Perhaps it is just assumed that large buildings are a bit taller and building=house is an average house height unless otherwise noted? Or maybe they use the Dutch AHN, which is a very accurate height scan of the Netherlands. Some people made it into a 3d picture, e.g. <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;snipboard.io&#x2F;Sq6C38.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;snipboard.io&#x2F;Sq6C38.jpg</a> (this only uses AHN data, not OSM, so it only has the tops of objects as points, but that&#x27;s still quite an accurate outline)."

"Mosche Vardi&#x27;s essay is provocative, but still leaves a few too many points vague and undefined for my taste.<p>The nature, questions, and value of research are one element of a larger set of questions I&#x27;ve been exploring.<p>I&#x27;ve recently run across David Hounshell&#x27;s work on R&amp;D at DuPont:  <i>Science and Corporate Strategy:  Du Pont R&amp;D 1902-1980</i>, originally published in the 1980s.<p><a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.worldcat.org&#x2F;title&#x2F;science-and-corporate-strategy-du-pont-rd-1902-1980&#x2F;oclc&#x2F;1086231462"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.worldcat.org&#x2F;title&#x2F;science-and-corporate-strateg...</a><p>For a ... short-ish ... synopsis, covering main themes, see Hounshell&#x27;s article:  &quot;Measuring the Return on Investment in R&amp;D: Voices from the Past, Visions of the Future&quot;<p><a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;books&#x2F;NBK45334&#x2F;?report=classic"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;books&#x2F;NBK45334&#x2F;?report=classic</a><p>Upshot:  R&amp;D is a risk-based activity, and it can have high payoffs, but also high costs.  Much of Hounshell&#x27;s book is about management&#x27;s attempts to both organise its research and research teams for optimal results, and to manage the costs and risks associated with it.  There was a period in which the labs were phenomenally productive, including a roughly decade-long span from the 1920s through 1930s where virtually the entire modern plastics industry (<i>Graduate</i> fans take note) was invented.  But also flops (a fake leather product produced in the 1960s notably).<p>This fits in with notions I&#x27;ve been noodling at of risks in economics -- an element of virtually all economic activities, but with distinctly different characteristics and scope.  R&amp;D tends more toward the dice-rolling variety (you may win), whereas some activities gamble with catastrophic and systemic loss.  Some fields appear to be little but raw risk balancing (much of finance, real estate, and of course, insurance) whilst others provide a greater opportunity to directly influence, reduce, adopt, or mitigate risks (engineering, generally).<p>There&#x27;s also the risk, or uncertainty, involved in attempting new activities.  The recent HN submission &quot;The Drugs Won&#x27;t Work&quot; <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;@belledejour_uk&#x2F;the-drugs-won-t-work-659c6d7a4ac1"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;@belledejour_uk&#x2F;the-drugs-won-t-work-659c...</a> (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=20789000"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=20789000</a>) talks of the problems of new drugs discovery, effectively a search through a 10^200 node space for potential beneficial compounds, with very few heuristics in reducing or guiding the search (Lipinski&#x27;s Rule of Five being one:  <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Lipinski%27s_rule_of_five"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Lipinski%27s_rule_of_five</a>).<p><i>All</i> research (and much coding) is effectively a search though a large possible solution space, subject to constraints and domain characteristics, for possible useful elements or combinations.  The problem of huge search spaces means that alternatives to brute-force exploration are quickly necessary.<p>Back to Du Pont:  the chemical search space is also large (pharmacology is effectively a branch of that), and low-hanging fruit was found early with small, simple, and readily-attained compounds:  the law of diminishing returns.  Worse was the discovery, often much later, that along with useful features came harmful ones -- the law of unintended consequences being another suprisingly general principles that arose from a specific discipline (sociology) but is applicable in nearly all others.<p>As for management:  by Hounshell&#x27;s account, management largely turned its researchers loose and told them to have fun.<p>There&#x27;s the further challenge that the discovery of keys rarely coincides with the knowledge of the lock in which it fits.  The phrase &quot;a solution in search of a problem&quot; was first applied (by Theodore Maiman: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Theodore_Maiman"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Theodore_Maiman</a>) to a technology of which there are almost certainly numerous instances of in your immediate vicinity:  lasers.<p>Early applications were thought to be in the application and delivery of <i>power</i> (Arthur C. Clarke makes a passing reference in <i>2001 A Space Odyssey</i> to blasting the Lunar monolith with one), but it was the characteristic of lasers as a tightly coherent transmissive blank slate onto which information could be encoded which proved its greatest use.<p>(This makes me suspect that materials such as graphene -- a uniform, monoatomic plane, might have its greatest application as information storage medium rather than physical materials, much as doped silicon has proved useful in semiconductors.)<p>Another part of my general study has been in thinking how technology works by considering what <i>technological mechanisms</i> fundamentally exist, and how those interact.  My list presently numbers nine (materials, fuels, power transmission &amp; transformation, process knowledge, structural knowledge, networks, systems, information, hygiene -- fuller descriptions elsewhere, still in process), which may or may not prove ultimately accurate.  But has been somewhat useful in thinking through numerous problems and applications.  Each mechanism has specific characteristics and limitations.<p>Upshot:  I <i>don&#x27;t</i> think &quot;technology&quot; is a bottomless bag of tricks.  It&#x27;s definitely useful, and well get more from it, but it also has costs, including complexity (itself a form of risk, which is to say, of debt), but there are bounds.  R&amp;D is exploring a space <i>with</i> constraints, in which both benefits and risks may be found.

"I understand where this is coming from, and it&#x27;s definitely from a good place, but honestly I think the solution is a bit naive.
Developers are not going to be able to sustain themselves by simply having their software connected to a package manager that charges them when they install a package. You might as well just sell proprietary software at that point.
We as a community need to be look at solutions like Tidelift [1] that will draw in real, serious and interested ENTERPRISE customers. That is where the revenue will come from and that it what will make it viable enough as a long term solution for both the developers AND consumers of FOSS.
Note: I am in now way affialiated with tidelift other than thinking they are smart dudes who are approaching this very pressing issue correctly.

That unit is rated to do over 2x the size of the room too but it can&#x27;t keep up. On days we know it&#x27;ll be 95+, we leave the AC on all day. Otherwise, the heat soaks into the walls so much that we can&#x27;t cool the house down after we get home and it&#x27;ll still be 85+ in our bedroom past midnight.

I carry around a notebook to write down ideas or solutions that have been grinding away since the last time I sat down to code.  On the computer I keep a running task list using notepad for session notes and gitlab kanban for larger tasks.  I find that most of the time my session notes are enough to pick up where I left off.  If I&#x27;m between tasks time to grab a new one from kanban.  If an idea pops up while I&#x27;m working on something else it is vital to enter a TODO in the source and an issue in gitlab and get back to what I was working on.  Gotta stay on task without going down a rabbit hole.

"I am in the process of making a major life change to focus on remote first work. I&#x27;ve recently moved and I am currently looking to purchase a house in a small town from where I plan to work full-time.<p>I think the caveats people bring up are serious and require careful consideration. They are part of why I am trying to find a company that is &quot;remote-first&quot; and I would prefer to avoid companies where I am one of a handful of remote employees while the rest of the team is co-located in one or more offices.<p>My major fears are:<p>* I suffer from isolation and loneliness and it impacts my mental well-being<p>* I find my career progression stalled<p>* I miss out on more lucrative compensation<p>* I find my coworkers making decisions without consulting me<p>* I experience an increase in general anxiety<p>* I find my productivity and focus to be significantly less<p>* I am unable to balance work&#x2F;life when they are combined in the same place<p>The worst case scenario is that a combination of my fears being realized forces me to recognize my unsuitability for remote work. I would then be stuck in a smaller city with less opportunity, potentially with a mortgage. I might be forced to sell my home for a loss, to move back into a bigger city and to attempt to find a normal job to rebuild my retirement savings.<p>My plan to mitigate these is to be aware of my fears and to put into place strategies that can deal with each one. I believe that companies that plan to be remote-reliant in the future will need expertise at the management level to deal with those issues throughout their workforce. Where there is legitimate fear there is also opportunity. I believe that all of the problems associated with remote work can be handled if they are openly discussed."

"The irony of natural gas is that while it emits half the carbon of coal or gasoline per same amount of energy release, methane is 20 times amore potent greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide. So a 3% leakage pretty much erases its green house savings. No fuel company wants to leak and waste that much methane, but stopping leakage is not easy.<p>One of the few facts the President got right is the US has reduced carbon emission more than any other country be converting from coal electricity to natural gas electricity.

"Debates over the electoral college tend to conflate two different things. The original purpose of the electoral college was a compromise between those who wanted the president directly elected, and those who wanted Congress to elect the president. While very small states have a modest edge as a result of using the number of members of Congress to decide the number of electors, the real purpose of the system is to add a layer of indirection to the election of the President, where the states have a say in their capacity as states.<p>That layer of indirection continues to exist today. Article II provides that “each state shall appoint” electors “in such manner as the Legislature thereof may direct.” So Minnesota could decide to have the state legislature appoint its electors, without a popular vote. (That would raise the importance of state government elections, which might be a good thing.)<p>At the same time, that layer of indirection could exist even in a purely proportional system. You could assign electoral votes based on population or number of house members.<p>So the debate over getting rid of the electoral college actually involves two different issues. Should the number of electors be proportional? And should we reduce the independent status of the states even more by taking away their intermediary role in electing the President?"

"Ownership of a multinational conglomarate corporation whose practices effect the lives of billions requires either governance or real stewardship.  Google is driven by one thing  making profit.

"This is LUDICROUS.  Recycling is harder than doing your taxes.  We desperately need uniformity on this.<p>&quot;<i>BEVERAGE BOTTLES

It&#x27;s impossible.<p>&quot;<i>A bottle with a cap or an opening the same size or smaller than the base of the bottle is probably going to be recyclable.</i>&quot;  -- WTF does the size of the opening have to do with it?<p>&quot;<i>The How2Recycle label is showing up on more products at the grocery store ...

"Good to see the list is short and relatively sane compared to other &quot;banned function&quot; lists.

"If I feel strongly enough to &quot;argue&quot; something online (which is a pretty high threshold already), the approach I take is to use questions.

Just try to not sound condescending when asking questions."
"Perhaps those well-versed in such arts can inform me, who knows little about ACH and the rest:<p>Why is it so slow?  I get that this is a system that can work built on top of any number of manual processes, but check-cashing scams are rampant and function in world where a major bank gets a check (apparently) from a different major bank and the customer is told it is all good....and possibly weeks later the check is noted as invalid and the deposit reversed.<p>...why can&#x27;t the big players (at least) confirm things quickly?

"At my first professional programming gig the company I worked for was selling items on Amazon. The listings were big ticket items that had several sellers competing on them.  Any seller could change some of the details of the listing, so suddenly all their competition would be shipping the item with wrong specs.  I wrote a program that periodically grabbed the titles of our live Amazon listings and compared them to our database of what we actually wanted the title to read.  I used Levenshtein Distance as a sort of &quot;severity of change&quot; metric, the program would sort the changes accordingly and send an email to a person on the sales team.  It was fun implementing Levenshtein Distance, but it wasn&#x27;t a perfect metric for this use case.  Some of the most severe changes would be a single digit changing; e.g. &quot;2gb&quot; vs &quot;8gb&quot;"
"It would be cool if one side of the route didn’t have to be to a light rail station. Or, if the trip wasn’t limited to a two mile area. I think it would be cool if you could order a ride on an app, a vehicle comes to your exact location and then takes you to your exact destination. That would be a real innovation! Transportation that takes me to other transportation that then requires walking the last mile isn’t exactly efficient. This service is Uber Pool that forces you to go to a train station instead of your exact destination? Why not just go to where you really want to go instead?"
"These are the two juiciest paragraphs for SaaS geeks:<p>&gt; We have a highly efficient go-to-market model, which consists of a self-service tier, a high velocity inside sales team, and an enterprise sales force. As of June 30, 2019, we had approximately 8,800 customers, increasing from approximately 7,700, 5,400 and 3,800 customers as of December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Approximately 590 of our customers as of June 30, 2019 had annual run-rate revenue, or ARR, of $100,000 or more, increasing from approximately 450, 240 and 130 customers as of December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, accounting for approximately 72%, 68%, 60% and 48% of our ARR, respectively. Further, as of June 30, 2019, we had 42 customers with ARR of $1.0 million or more, up from 29, 12 and two customers as of December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. As of June 30, 2019, our 10 largest customers represented approximately 14% of our ARR and no single customer represented more than 5% of our ARR.<p>... and ...<p>&gt; Our business has experienced rapid growth and is capital efficient. Since inception, we have raised $92.0 million of capital, net of share repurchases, and we had $63.6 million of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash as of June 30, 2019. We generated revenue of $100.8 million and $198.1 million in 2017 and 2018, respectively, representing year-over-year growth of 97%. Our revenue was $85.4 million in the six months ended June 30, 2018 compared to $153.3 million in the six months ended June 30, 2019, representing period-over-period growth of 79%. Substantially all of our revenue is subscription software sales. Our net (loss) income was $(2.6) million, $(10.8) million, $0.5 million and $(13.4) million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2018 and the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2019, respectively.

"From about 2016-2018 I was wondering why my iMessages became fodder for strangers to parrot back to me at coffee shops in the small USA town in which I was living. Of course, I explored the idea that the other parties of these iMessage conversations (usually thousands of miles away with no apparent connection to people in my locale) had somehow betrayed me. This was likely not the case, as I confronted those parties and they adamantly denied discussing or sharing our conversations.<p>It’s likely that my devices were owned and on display for hackers in my local community. This article is a reminder of the trauma experienced as a result of the paranoia and mistrust I experienced, and a reminder that we are not to trust our consumer devices to really care about our privacy.<p>If Apple cared about user security they’d build robust defenses into the devices that empower the end user to have a degree of confidence regarding security. Instead, the iPhone on which I’m typing could be at this time could be 100% owned and leaking data in real time and I’m afforded no visual indication of that possibility. The camera and microphone could be hot and transmitting and Apple refuses to offer any way to confirm this in a robust, hardware-visual, unhackable way.  That computer camera activity led’s can be hacked (or could be in previous iterations) is indicative of the level of irresponsibility going on.<p>The blob that is the combination of a modem that interacts with cell towers, and the vastly complex computer tied to it, affords zero insight into what the phone is doing or whether it is betraying me.<p>And, such privacy breaches are enough to ruin lives.

"Although I&#x27;m generally not a big fan of regulation, this is one area where regulation might be appropriate. The two marketplaces run by Google and Apple are <i>so large and substantial</i> in their size and outsize economic influence that there should (ideally) be laws granting developers of apps on these platforms some set of rights, and some form of fair due process if they&#x27;re accused of ToS violations.<p>We&#x27;d have to either have Congress enact something (a long shot), or have individual states grant such protections to developers or companies based in the state. The most crucial state in this matter is likely Delaware, since many companies are incorporated there."

"The more I use Linux Containers (big fan of LXD) the more I&#x27;m convinced Solaris got it right with Zones, Crossbow, ZFS, SMF also for Zone services - Linux is still not there but instead we have lot&#x27;s of vendor glue-code in go and many asteriks what is not possible. IMHO Linux should implement something like the zone concept that conceals cgroups, network, mount-namespaces - quota is still broken in btrfs, you can&#x27;t delegate ZFS commands into a ZFS LXD-Container (where quota actually works) and if you attempt to run something like Docker Swarm in LXD you realize only parts of the kernel are network-namespace aware - it probably will converge to either some vendor solution or it will be resolved in the kernel (I doubt the ZFS integration will happen, as it looks like the current devs are activly fighting ZFS) but conceptionally the concept of a zone as a security boundary feels more sane to me than the glued-together mess in ther kernel at the moment. With kernel zones there was even a concept for stonger security."

"&gt; At one point in 2013, some Amazon employees began scanning randomly selected third-party products in Amazon warehouses for lead content, say people familiar with the tests. Around 10% of the products tested failed, one says. The failed products were purged, but higher-level employees decided not to expand the testing, fearing it would be unmanageable if applied to the entire marketplace, the people familiar with the tests say. Amazon declined to comment on the episode.<p>This crosses a higher threshold than many of the other anecdotes, it sounds like there’s an actual record of willful negligence.<p>What’s the likely big picture economic situation with Amazon? Is there any way to estimate where the bulk of fake goods are coming from and the money through Amazon is going to? China was mentioned several times in the article, is this a China problem, or actually bigger than that? Has Amazon formed a tunnel that primarily moves illegal low-quality product into the US and money out? Is Amazon the largest vector for foreign goods that are breaking US laws to be sold in the US, or is this an internet problem in general? I can’t think of other US retailers, even online, that I’m scared to shop at for fear of fake product."

"Been of the opinion a while a lot of issues could be resolved if we agreed on a streamable binary format that had good definitions for data types (including integers and dates).<p>String formats are great an all for viewing in whatever text viewer but so inefficient and then you have the whole escaping string inside of strings and string encoding binary data.<p>If we all agreed on a binary format then there would be a viewer for it in every debugging tool.<p>ASN.1, Protobuf, BSON, ION. MSGPACK whatever. I would prefer a binary format that doesn&#x27;t repeat keys for efficiency where the schema can be sent separately or inlined. But even one that&#x27;s basically binary JSON with more types would be step up."
"I want to note that there&#x27;s something that has been rarely mentioned in these threads and I wonder why: longer education time (and earlier retirement).<p>On my parents generation a small percentage of people went to university, and on my grandparents generation most people started working on their early teens (post-war, I&#x27;m from Spain). In contrast, today having an undergraduate degree is very common, and a master or even doctorate is no rare. This makes a 10-15 year difference of no-work time to our lives, which is ~1&#x2F;4th of our work lives. Where before we were expected to work from 16 to 66 years old (~50 years), now we are expected to work from 22 years old to 62 years old (40 years).<p>Only this is a reduction of work by 20%, or a full work day.<p>To add on top of that, our life expectancy has been increasing in all developed countries (except, USA). While this does not take away work time, it does add leisure time to our lives.<p>To be clear, I agree with the article and sentiment here and we should be working shorter weeks. Only wanted to note this since many people seem to ignore it when discussing work week."
"Don’t study success. The people who double their money by betting it all on black didn’t have some divine insight that you can copy, they just got lucky. But do study failure. The people who lose everything by betting it all on red did have a fatal flaw in their approach to risk that will be valuable for you to avoid or at least be well aware of.<p>One of the obvious faliures to study is that many great teams with great ideas failed to get any funding because they didn’t walk the startup walk or talk the startup talk with potential investors, which is exactly why you should talk about copying Tesla and about growth hacking."

"My biggest problem is not being able to discern the quality of an item before I purchase. Ratings were last reliable 10 years ago. Different brands used to mean different products, so you used to be able to feature-and-price compare. About the only thing I&#x27;ve figured out to do is to look at pictures to try to group items by manufacturer, purchase one-per-real-manufacturer, then return all of the obvious crap and <i>hope</i> I end up with at least one good item.<p>Maybe we need a Facebook plugin through which people can (willingly) share their purchases.

The web is still the last bastion of developer freedom, albeit not the platform users have been trained to use these days."

"Very strongly disagree with the idea that consuming art is not in itself a generative process. Reading (or many other forms of consumption), if done attentively require practise. There is a world of difference between anxious, distracted twitter scrolling and a good reader.<p>All a book gives you is letters on a page, the rest of the exercise is left to the brain of the reader. Reading is a difficult and enormously complex process, and by no means less of an active or creative activity than writing. Becoming a skilled and mindful reader takes a lot of time.

"Note sure if this is the best solution. But works so far for me: ELK + Redis + Curator.   Everything in a docker contrainer. Single Machine Setup. Curator deletes old logs. Redis is responsible for caching. Logs are put directly to redis. 
I think one of the most important metrics:<p>Performance
4 Core Machine with 32Gb Ram
about 3000 logs per second. 70% CPU usage and 80% SSD Usage-
Quite happy with the setup, since the SSD can be upgraded to a faster one. Also a more powerfull machine could handle about 10000 logs per second.
Would love to hear other number from Splunk or similar solutions.<p>Costs: Nearly zero. Some time to setup and bring redis + curator into play."

What I mean by this is: they clearly could have chosen to gain a massive infection rate by combining this with hacking a well-known popular site, or even pulling more visits from (say) social media, but instead the malicious actor chose to limit their intended recipients to run the exploits for a smaller set of targets for much longer while remaining undetected.<p>This, to me, hints at a state-actor with specific intent."

But in terms of eliminating something costing large numbers of computer time or money, Wave brought absolutely nothing to the table.<p>I remember seeing the hyperventilating response to Wave by tech people at the time and wondering what they were actually experiencing. Because what I saw was yet another Google initiative that would be shut down and forgotten fairly quickly."

"&quot;Thank you very much, but I will buy the Computable numbers, instead. They do not require abandoning my sanity (although I am aware I must still abandon rationality).&quot;<p>In particular, the reals mean you accept measure theory, which in one of its key results says you can build two spheres of radius x from one sphere of radius x, and no holes. The computables don&#x27;t go there.<p>There are infinitely many computable numbers, but only <i>countably</i> many -- no more than of natural or rational numbers. That turns out to be enough for everything sane you want to do.<p>Of course you need altered versions of the key theorems of calculus, because the computables are not continuous in the &quot;real&quot; sense. The numbers blur a bit, instead, to cover the gaps, much as water manages to behave like a fluid despite being made of nothing but discrete particles. The differences are a PITA but keep you on the straight and narrow. You get the same answers for everything that makes sense, and no answer for things that don&#x27;t.<p>All the supposedly real numbers you will ever encounter are computable (too). Roots, pi, e, anything representable with a Taylor series. So you don&#x27;t really give anything up.<p>Reals make a good enough approximation, which means you don&#x27;t need to go hungry. Pretend you&#x27;re using reals. Nobody needs to know. Everybody else is, too. The sane, anyway."

Rochefort on the other hand led the intelligence effort that allowed Nimitz to ambush the Japanese fleet six months later. Both of these men ultimately lost “office politics” which led to them both being marginalized and ignored by their governments after their great victories. Rochefort ended up the better of the two, only being reduced to building dry docks, while Sorge ended up being shot,even though the Japanese tried multiple times to trade him back for their own captured spies.<p>One side note - it’s amazing how good and ruthless the soviet spy network was.

The Army started noticing fatty streak formation(first stage of atherosclerosis)[2] in arteries of dead soldiers during autopsy, which now leads us to believe this starts in youth and progresses from there.<p>1) <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ingentaconnect.com&#x2F;content&#x2F;ben&#x2F;vdp&#x2F;2005&#x2F;00000002&#x2F;00000002&#x2F;art00006"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ingentaconnect.com&#x2F;content&#x2F;ben&#x2F;vdp&#x2F;2005&#x2F;00000002...</a><p>2) <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;media.jamanetwork.com&#x2F;news-item&#x2F;autopsy-based-study-examines-prevalence-of-atherosclerosis-among-u-s-service-members&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;media.jamanetwork.com&#x2F;news-item&#x2F;autopsy-based-study-...</a>"
It was a failure but I’m glad they tried it. Hopefully something like this comes to fruition and we learn more and more with every iteration. Solar roads are a great idea. Maybe it means it needs daily sweeping with electric vacuum trucks or something but if it’s producing enough electricity then it’s worth it.
"Nice unit economics:
Our Connected Fitness Subscriber Lifetime Value for fiscal 2017, fiscal 2018, and fiscal 2019, was $267.1 million, $604.4 million, and $1,053.8 million, respectively, or $3,433, $4,015, and $3,593 per Connected Fitness Subscriber, respectively.<p>As we expand our content offering, develop new interactive software features, and grow our community of Members, we believe we can maintain a low Average Net Monthly Connected Fitness Churn, resulting in a high Connected Fitness Subscriber Lifetime Value. In addition, with the growth of our Connected Fitness Subscriber base over time, we expect to improve our Subscription Contribution Margin as we scale our fixed content production costs.<p>Net Customer Acquisition Cost (profit) can be calculated as Adjusted Sales and Marketing Expense (which excludes depreciation and amortization expense and stock-based compensation expense) less Adjusted Connected Fitness Product Gross Profit (which excludes depreciation and amortization expense and stock-based compensation expense). Our Net Customer Acquisition Costs (profit) for fiscal 2017, fiscal 2018, and fiscal 2019, was $14.2 million, $(4.9) million, and $1.6 million, respectively, or $183, $(33), and $5 per Connected Fitness Subscriber added, respectively. We believe we will continue to drive rapid payback and efficiencies in Net Customer Acquisition Costs (profit) by further leveraging sales and marketing investments as a result of heightened brand awareness and growing word-of-mouth referrals. Changes in Connected Fitness Product margins or sales and marketing expenses may result in an inability to fully offset our customer acquisition costs."

"I was full-time WFH for 6 wonderful years.  I was happy, my productivity was off the charts, I was saving tons of money because I didn&#x27;t have to spend it on my car and clothes, I had extra time that I wasn&#x27;t wasting on my commute, etc.<p>Then, we had a big shake-up.  A bunch of senior people left, and new &quot;leadership&quot; came in to &quot;transform&quot; our workplace.

"I work in manufacturing and we&#x27;re impacted as well. The largest impact is reduction in Chinese end-user business.<p>The products we make are used in Chinese factories to assemble smartphones. Believe it or not (I do) but the Chinese do not possess the technology nor the manufacturing sophistication to make <i>high quality</i> items (read: iPhones) on a large scale <i></i>efficiently<i></i> with a domestic (to China) supply chain.<p>Sure, the factories that produce iPhones are capable of producing a conforming iPhone. But the machines it takes to produce a conforming iPhone require technology, skill, and technique the Chinese <i></i>currently<i></i> do not possess.<p>So, believe it or not (I can prove it) the Chinese buy their factory equipment from small suppliers in the U.S. where the quality is decent enough to get equipment capable of producing an iPhone. We make the machines they use to laminate screens.<p>We are currently incentivizing China to develop the technology to domestically create the iPhone. That isn&#x27;t a problem because it puts me out of business. That is a problem for the western economy because it reduces Chinese reliance on the Apple supply chain. We&#x27;re teaching them, through trial and error, how to replace Apple with Huawei in the Chinese market. If Apple loses the Chinese market; the world market is lost inside of 10 years. We&#x27;re teaching Huawei how to make an iPhone by brute force by making it economical to do so.<p>Nevermind the price of materials like aluminum has gone crazy. Even the DFARS stuff has gone up as a result of reduced supply in domestic markets. And for some customers we can&#x27;t use anything else. So either make up the supply difference or get fucked on DFARS requirements. You&#x27;re the ones costing America it&#x27;s world dominance. Not us.<p>So do whatever you want, conservatives.

"I think it was CPAN that killed Perl, at least that was a major nail in the coffin for me.  I have no idea what the CPAN of today is like, but back in the mid-late 90&#x27;s it was horribly unreliable.  There were dozens, if not hundreds of modules that did the same thing, and a lot of them had major bugs.  But installing one was the big issue, as it would always choose the latest release of any module in the dependency chain, including the perl interpreter itself.  And this was done without any hint as to whether the module actually worked with the latest versions of those modules.  So, you&#x27;d end up upgrading a bunch of modules, very likely breaking things that worked.  And at the end, it&#x27;d &quot;upgrade&quot; the perl interpreter.  And by &quot;upgrade&quot; I mean install a new copy, replace all OS references to the new version, but not include any of those modules you just installed.  So you had to re-install everything again.<p>Perl&#x27;s main use at the time was developing CGI scripts.  It had big disadvantages over things like PHP and Netscape Commerce at the time, but people still seemed to like Perl.  As complex web side code grew more complex, requiring a lot of 3rd party components to get Perl to do anything, people seemed to abandoned it pretty quickly.<p>I still use Perl today, version 5.  Mostly just to process text files, but I still don&#x27;t use any 3rd party libs."

"I am a parent of two boys—ages 7 and 4–and I hardly recognize  the negative forces that this author laments over because my wife and I have simply chosen not to raise our kids that way.<p>When my boys get home, we get outside and do sports.   We’re in the middle of (tackle) football season right now and that’s what my 7 year-old does five days a week for two hours every evening.

My four year-old spends the practices on the sidelines, digging in the dirt with other little brothers and sisters and chasing the bigger kids around the track when they run laps.<p>When football season is over, we move on to other team sports.  When those are over, we ride our bikes around the neighborhood and play pick-up football games in the front yard.<p>What we don’t do:  iPads, TVs, or smart phones.  It’s not that came into parenthood with some anti-technology mindset.  Rather, we let our kids have these devices and we saw immediately the negative effects on their behavior, attitude, and motivation, and so we took them away.

"If you&#x27;d like to read a well researched book on the subversive goals of the CCP, I suggest you read &quot;Silent Invasion&quot;[1].

"Road traffic is caused by two main things: congestion and bottlenecks.<p>Congestion is solved by properly designing cities and their transit systems so that there&#x27;s an optimal ratio of car&#x2F;bus&#x2F;train&#x2F;bike use.<p>Bottlenecks are solved by properly designing the road network itself so that you don&#x27;t have situations where 5 lanes become 2, or highway onramps&#x2F;off-ramps that are too short and cause an entire lane to be backed up by people entering and leaving.<p>Yes adding more lanes by itself doesn&#x27;t solve the problem due to induced demand, but refusing to expand highways while simultaneously neglecting to have transit keep up with growth is even worse.<p>I personally think that all new housing should have a state &quot;transit expansion&quot; tax per unit of housing it introduces, to allow the system to keep up with growth."
"I sometimes wonder if we need a better phonics. Doing it by letters feels crude, it requires a big gestalt moment when the kid puts the sounds together, and overemphasizes our very malleable vowels.<p>Something based more on syllables would seem better to me. Consider a simple work like “back”: kids sound out buh-ah-kuh which is a completely crazy version of the real word. You can’t say a B without a vowel, but instead of using the actual vowel (a) consonants usually get an “uh” added to them.<p>Learning syllables means learning maybe 5-10 times as many sounds, but then it’s also easy to add “ing” and “sh” and all the many combinations of letters that can’t be individually decoded.<p>The second problem is the kid has to pick out those letter combinations even though words are just a stream of letters. I wonder if it would be supportive to write the words in multiple colors to show the internal structure?<p>I feel like this must all exist already in some curriculum...?"

"1. Check in the voters as usual, but issue them a paper ID for the ballot they can take with them (either a printed receipt or a tab they can tear off the ballot maybe?).<p>2. Publish results to the public Internet using the ID as an anonymizer.<p>3. Anyone who wishes to report that their vote was improperly counted or not counted at all can simply present their receipt to verify their identity.<p>Why is this hard?<p>Edit: obviously there are complexities when it comes to people who either misremember their selections, but I also see no reason you couldn&#x27;t also have a copy of your ballot emailed or printed out for you from the voting precinct."

"Massively disagree that reading a book and reddit are comparable. I guess if you only read trash novels you can close the gap, but there is great value to reading a quality book or a periodical like the Economist.<p>Something I’ve been thinking about recently is how very educated people who would never read a tabloid paper or watch a stupid reality TV show will happily retweet lowest common denominator memes or outrage twitter. Because it’s so new, and because everything is intermingled, those people sleepwalk into consuming trash culture. It’s like a well trained athlete has been tricked into living off fast food."

Was in China when the first protest happened and the news coverage was mostly saying things like that the people are clueless in Hong Kong and don’t understand the law about extradition. They had various experts all saying similar things and they would also point to random weibo posts about totally not on the payroll “people” saying they want their city back from the protesters.. I mean it’s one thing if China’S central government wants Hong Kong to be a certain way but dressing it up as “lots of ordinary folks agree with them” is pretty disingenuous and it seems very fair for any platform to call the government out on it—-especially non-Chinese owned platforms.
"Meditation sometimes reveals itself through meditation. It&#x27;s kinda like recursion in programming. I come from Vietnam. Meditation in Vietnamese is translated literally to &quot;sitting zen&quot; (ngồi thiền). Sitting seems like the optimal balance point for meditation. Standing&#x2F;walking has more distraction. Lying down makes you prone to sleeping. Now, I haven&#x27;t figured out which sitting position is more optimal. Perhaps, the lotus position is popular for a reason."

"Fixing congestion by speeding up traffic is a red herring.  Think of peak usage (rush hour) like pouring a 5-gallon bucket into a sink.  The peak volume will always be able to overwhelm the pipe no matter how big the pipe is but a big pipe sure helps it go away faster.  This principal applies to mass transit as well.  There will always be backup, like on the subway platform at 5:05pm, but more capacity (more lanes, faster flow, more frequent service, etc) means it will cycle through faster.<p>This article&#x27;s gripes about measuring the cost of congestion are mostly accurate.  That TTI study is laughable.  Their gripes about mobility not being a goal are totally bunk.  I understand their agenda and why they feel this way but the reduction in cost of moving a fixed distance has enabled us to massively increase our standard of living.  They just don&#x27;t like it because it&#x27;s made certain other societal problems more bearable so we haven&#x27;t fixed them yet (e.g. terrible zoning in some places) and it&#x27;s environmentally unfriendly.  Barring some revolution in transportation on par with the automobile I doubt they&#x27;ll go unfixed that much longer.<p>I&#x27;m not in the least bit sympathetic to the author&#x27;s belief that increased difficulty of travel is good.  I grew up somewhere that was hard to get to and the economic reality that bring sucks (your dollars only go like 80% as far) and people would be stupid to want to impose on this on themselves.  The author is conflating his distaste for the automobile (which is fashionable and has some merit,especially on environmental grounds) with a distaste for lower cost&#x2F;higher speed transportation in general.  If you were to re-write his article and instead complain about how city buses and subways have made it possible for people&#x27;s range to extend beyond their neighborhood or imagine some alternative reality in which cars are replaced with carbon neutral mass transit of equivalent cost&#x2F;throughput it would become immediately apparent how nonsensical this distaste for reducing the time&#x2F;money cost of physical distance is.<p>Edit: My analogy is for reasonable pipe sizes only."
"What a busy topic!<p>My first reaction (to the general topic) was, &quot;Well, of course they had to put a stop to that.   And international message forums with many participants?

So out of 11-12 hours of not-me-time, you want me to completely keep my trap shut?  That&#x27;s a hard ask.<p>Here&#x27;s an example.  Earlier this week, I&#x27;m on my way to the subway and I see a fight, and I also see piss on two sets of seats on both sides of the subway car.  Then I&#x27;m at work and my colleague, unprompted and as I come in, remarks how many more heroin-addled people there are in Midtown, Manhattan than he&#x27;s ever seen. I then blurt out a rant about the Mayor, criminal justice policies I consider wrong (such as the push to lower incarceration without consequence), and a few other things that were aggressively opinionated and political, in an open office environment.  Shortly thereafter I somewhat regretted it (but I never expected any consequences).<p>We&#x27;re only human.<p>It just needs to be channeled.

"We never really used Encarta, and I don&#x27;t really know anyone who ever did. Right in the middle of the CD-ROMs are big and DSL just starting to become available period we got a few educational CDs that did more specialised things like only the history and current state of geographical information, or just mathematics, or just historical events of one country. No full encyclopedia was really digitally popular as the schools and libraries all had plenty of physical copies and people around to help use&#x2F;find them.<p>It probably didn&#x27;t help that it was a Microsoft-only deal as most of the stuff was an odd mix Netware-driven PC&#x27;s without Optical drives (we had ZIP!) or library computers that were locked in a box so you couldn&#x27;t really put a CD in them. And everything else was an Apple Mac, so you could put the CD in but you got nothing out of it.<p>We did have something else, I don&#x27;t remember the name of it, but it was like a network-CD-drive-server device that worked on Windows 95, 98 and 2000, as well as Macs, and we had a cross-platform (flash&#x2F;shockwave based AFAIK) viewer thing that was probably an encyclopaedia but it was never named or marketed as such. It didn&#x27;t have videos but it did have the same information as the paper versions.<p>Most people who did end up owning (some version of) Encarta got a demo or companion version with some other product, much like the Microsoft Works package you sometimes got with systems, but right around that time Wikipedia was already gaining popularity."

"An interesting assertion, but the article is both vacuous and confusing.

"&gt; One of capitalism&#x27;s most durable myths is that it has reduced human toil. This myth is typically defended by a comparison of the modern forty-hour week with its seventy- or eighty-hour counterpart in the nineteenth century. The implicit -- but rarely articulated -- assumption is that the eighty-hour standard has prevailed for centuries. The comparison conjures up the dreary life of medieval peasants, toiling steadily from dawn to dusk. We are asked to imagine the journeyman artisan in a cold, damp garret, rising even before the sun, laboring by candlelight late into the night.<p>Hours spent working is hardly the same thing as quantifying human toll. Most people in agrarian society subsisted on a near-starvation diet, to the point where most women would not get their period until their late teens and early 20s. If you go to a civil war museum you might be surprised at how small the uniforms are - lower diets pushed average heights down by several inches. Antibiotics were non-existent so infections were lethal at drastically higher rates than they are today. Mortality between the ages of 0-20 averaged ~50%, and life expectancy at 20 was usually in the 40s or 50s. Due to this high mortality rate, the births per woman required to form the replacement rate was 6-8 (this is counted of the women that survive to adulthood, raw BPW is about half that). This meant that women effectively had to spend most of their adult lives bearing and caring for children, a big reason why agrarian societies are overwhelmingly patriarchal. Rates of literacy and education did vary, and were as high as 40% in some agrarian societies, but were still far lower than the &gt;90% rate we see in most countries today. And I&#x27;m not even going to dig into the can of worms that is the amount of slavery that occurred in agrarian society that was displaced by industrialization.<p>Capitalism may have a higher demand in terms of hours worked in explicit employment, but I doubt many today would genuinely trade life in a capitalist country for life in a pre-industrial society."

I think a lot of HN readers would find that part interesting.<p>Like others, I was struck by the discussion of (not) moving away from home. Arnade describes the bewildered reaction that he usually got from people if he asked them why they never left the area where they grew up. i.e., how is that even a question?"
"The testing and treatment of tick borne pathogens is a fine line between politics, science and empathy is because many people have been treated poorly by the medical industry. The majority of the symptoms are ignored by physicians or misdiagnosed. In many cases, co-infections or existing immuno-suppressive conditions are ignored by physicians. That&#x27;s happened to a number of people I know.<p>It is very common for most practitioners to be ignorant of: HLA DR gene types (can accumulate metals, mycotoxins, lyme toxins, etc), the nature of the Lyme bacteria strains: spirochtte (reproductive, doxycycline susceptible), round bound starvation form (resistant to most antiobiotics), and the nature of biofilm colonies (antibiotic resistant) that exist in nature and our bodies. Furthermore, most physicians do not know what labs and tests to apply to a patient: Igenex and Galaxy labs for Lyme, Bartonella, Babesia, etc testing; c3a, c4a, tgf-b1, mmp-9, inflammation markers.<p>In short, each human phenotype, genetic expression, and immune context are all highly unique ... which means that every case is different. Inflammation from our immune response is the primary driver of symptoms and is very, very often mis-diagnosed as something else like MS or dementia (happened to a number of people I know). We need a lot more data to finally help educate physicians and bring the vast majority them out of the stone age. We need to educate everyone on complex systems, nutrition, and biology instead of just authority."
"A while ago I used Hubspot CRM for a bit. I think it&#x27;s slow and quirky, and to me it&#x27;s a big red flag how hard they make it to get the data out (or, well, 2 years ago at least).<p>But Hubspot gets one thing right that I never understood other CRMs can&#x27;t do. If Hubspot sees an email from name@company.com, they automatically make a new contact for that name, and a new organization for that company (derived from the @company.com), enrich it all with available data (employee size etc), which I guess they get from some Clearbit-like data. This is super useful, because it means all relevant organization about a new lead who just reached out is just there. The only manual logging I ever have to do is eg log calls or write internal notes. No bookkeeping whatsoever.<p>Similarly, if I want to log someone I met at, say, a conference, I just enter their email address from their business card (or whatever) and -poof- the contact and organization are there. Maybe I&#x27;ll add the phone number if they&#x27;re oldschool like that, but that&#x27;s it. All the otherfields are immediately in &quot;good enough&quot; mode.<p>A while later I tried Close.io, who advertise <i>loudly</i> in the blogosphere about how much other CRMs make you click and type, and I had to make every contact and organization by hand! How is that automation? I simply don&#x27;t understand how any CRM in 2019 can ship with so much manual data entry. What am I missing? Is my use case such an edge case?<p>If you&#x27;d add stuff like this, then maybe I&#x27;d be interested in switching over. But having to manually maintain every single piece of data, when much information is publicly available from various sources, is just not worth my time.<p>And if you <i>have</i> this feature, I&#x27;d highlight it proudly on the website :D<p>To other HN&#x27;ers, if you have suggestions for CRMs that get this right, I&#x27;m interested."

"The thing about Encarta to me is that it felt so much more interactive than what we have today.<p>Nowadays we read a Wikipedia article or watch a Youtube video on a topic but never interact with the content. It&#x27;s all very passive. I was a child during the heyday of Encarta and I remember I had it and a few other specialized encyclopedias (one about animals, one about sea life, one about dinosaurs!!) and they were all interactive. I miss this about computers. Not all things have to be a game or passive which is what I see nowadays when a child has a screen in front of their face."

"&quot;Ignore advice&quot; is not good advice. Even for startups. There are so many predictable ways that founders screw up. I,  personally, have committed most of them. A few of them I avoided, or stopped doing soon enough to survive, and often it was with the help of good advice. YC gives good advice: Talk to your users. Build something people want. Run lean. Those are all great for people starting out. There is a lot of knowledge much more specialized that, contained in the collective wisdom of startup operators and investors. The challenge is to vet your sources, know which advice applies to your situation, and how to implement it. Nobody can teach you how to be a good judge of character. And nobody knows your startup well enough to decide for you which advice and how. But we can all learn from others who have gone through the ringer, whether it&#x27;s PG, Michael Seibel, Naval, Lemkin or others."
"2010 - 2030 This kind of thing happens with lots of alarming stories in the news. People are kind of worried that they will get dragged in as a crime suspect simple because they were driving by the area when a crime was being committed nearby.<p>2030 - 2040 This kind of investigation becomes so common that the independent news outlets just stop finding instances of it. People are kind of relaxing about it.<p>2040 - 2050 It turns out that, like DNA evidence, there&#x27;s now an entire innocence project started dedicated to getting people out of incarceration for any crime where the totality of evidence was GPS data and some made up stories.<p>2050 -&gt; Oh sorry that new energy source blew up, earth is gone."

"I think the biggest realization I&#x27;ve ever had is that things take time away. The sensation of procrastination happens when you feel the &quot;thing you need to do&quot; should take some smaller constrained amount of time, usually in days or weeks or sometimes months.<p>But if you can stomach that the thing may take years or even a decade, you&#x27;d feel much less like you were procrastinating.<p>In addition, if you assume that the thing will always be done piecemeal, here and there, or when you can remember to do it say like cleaning a room or organizing a thing, then that can also alleviate the sensation of procrastination.<p>The sensation tends to occur when you maintain a false belief that the things you need to get done should take hours or days instead of weeks or years."
"I use firefox with ublock origin and privacy badger and I can&#x27;t recall the last time I ran into a site that was broken because of it. But, I visit a fairly narrow section of the internet regularly so there might not be much overlap between what I browse and you browse.<p>I also use the multi-account container add on and the temporary container add on. This allows me to pin a few big sites to their own containers (google, amazon, etc) and open all other new tabs in temporary containers. This setup works great and appears to help keep firefox fast over time. I use duck duck go to search but firefox makes it trivial for me to re-run a search with google if I need to.<p>I also run an ad blocking vpn on google cloud using Algo. I use google cloud because the vpn can run on the permanently free tier and I only pay for network traffic (which is near zero), and I also enjoy the irony of it. I have wireguard clients setup on all of my devices to use the vpn either permanently (phone) or on demand (laptops). Having this vpn is nice as it makes it easy to block ads in apps on my kids mobile devices.<p>This vpn setup works ok but not quite as well as when I ran the same thing using Streisand and open vpn clients. I only say this because I have a homebrew whole-house audio setup with a bunch of google audio chromecasts and no matter how I tweak the wireguard client settings I cannot get that casting to work properly. With open vpn clients, those settings are a cinch."

"One think I didn&#x27;t realize until my daughter and I read the book together: in the book there were two good witches, the witch of the North (the first one Dorothy meets after landing on the witch of the East), and the witch of the South (the one that tells her she can use the shoes to get home).  The movie combined the two characters.  Then they had to come up with a reason why the good witch didn&#x27;t immediately tell Dorothy to click her heels together and go home.  In the book, only the Witch of the South knew this."
"Wonders of Readline become painfully apparent when you have to use a program that doesn&#x27;t employ it despite having a line-by-line command input interface. But! By some stroke of luck and computer magic, Readline can be injected right into the program, at least in Unixes: there&#x27;s an util called `with-readline` for that.<p>Some programs have the editing features but lack command history for some reason, or don&#x27;t store it between sessions―this is also solved by the addition of Readline."
"React is more functional favored. It&#x27;s very recommended for functional languages having static type systems, at least for language like JavaScript heavily relies on object literal.<p>The problem is, dynamic OOP languages like Ruby and Python are   Okay to work with, since you know the class of an object you know a lot of things (schema, behavior, etc).<p>But for JavaScript and React, mutable classes are not quite useful since they mutate themselves, and could stop the app from re-rendering. it&#x27;s more likely people are using object literals, which can hardly go far.<p>With TypeScript&#x27;s structural and gradual type system, it&#x27;s flexible and easy enough to type object literals with the union and intersection types, without forcing people to use classes."
"I like the idea; if someone wants to make some money off of customers who are more willing to pay than to make efforts to avoid paying, it&#x27;s nice to have an easy way to do that.<p>But whereas &quot;auto-magic&quot; is a good characteristic in software, it&#x27;s kind of off-putting in financial matters.<p>As far as the software goes, if it &quot;just works&quot;, that&#x27;s great.  When it comes to the money, I don&#x27;t want to know if it &quot;just works&quot;.  Within 2 minutes of arriving at the Scarf site, I want to know how much goes in one end, how much comes out the other end, how to set and change the prices, and how much (if any) leaks to the Scarf service.

"More anecdotal data, but our family (which used to spend $5k+ a year on Amazon) decided to actively buy locally <i>and</i> do what we can to reduce packaging waste (mainly for food).

There are some huge mailboxes out there, but messengers have this problem too and they solve it somehow (I suspect trivial &amp;last_date=... from programming tg bots).<p>Second, and this may be due to bad clients (haven’t seen good however), imap is just sloooow. It doesn’t update instantly, but instead I have to enter every folder and pull down with my finger to update it. It can show outdated messages which I deleted on a pc <i>for ten seconds</i> before it figures out that they were deleted. My guess that it has something to do with an infinite number of roundtrips which this protocol is based on. Occasionally it shows N unread when there is none. Even push notifications fail to work properly most of the time (same server-side issues?) And with all these complications, I still have to download every attachment by finger. How come that heavy sites&#x2F;forums&#x2F;boards&#x2F;messengers always instantly show new data and mail cannot?

"The article lists the characteristics of a good engineer:<p><pre><code>  * has a better grasp of existing software they can reuse
  * (has) a better grasp of engineering tools, automating away most of the routine aspects of their own job
  * design systems that are more robust and easier to understand by others
  * the decisions they make save you from work you did not know could be avoided
</code></pre>
I obviously concord with the analysis (not sure about the 10X myth). It also states that:<p><pre><code>  * Google, Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, and Microsoft all run a dizzying number of the largest technology systems in the world, yet, they famously have some of the most selective interview processes
</code></pre>
This sounds a bit like a paradox to me. Given the current state of &quot;selective interview processes&quot; (algo riddles, whiteboard coding, etc.), none of the above traits can be easily evaluated in a candidate during an interview. On the other hand, these companies <i>do hire</i> stellar engineers: the technological supremacy of FAANG is irrefutable."

Well, you’re not going to solve the problem of too many cars and the slow traffic that results with cars. It’d be hard to get special treatment for cars with a premium feature.

It&#x27;s hard to test theories when the underlying system constantly changes like it does in economics. Something that works today might not work tomorrow. A theory that looks sound when applied to yesteryears data might stop working before the sun rises. When many others try to apply the same tricks that made you successful the cake on that table might suddenly be divided into so many pieces that everybody will go home hungry. You must find a new table with a new cake but old data and old theory doesn&#x27;t help much with that because someone else is already there.

It makes perfect sense: meat is expensive and difficult to work with, so low-cost chains like these have been serving really disgustingly low-quality meat for quite some time now; in some cases it could barely even be called meat.<p>Plant-based meat, on the other hand, can be both cheaper <i>and</i> less gross at the same time, <i>and</i> it might help them cut down on calories and improve their health image.<p>I wonder what impact it&#x27;ll have on climate change when McDonalds stops buying real beef."

I&#x27;d like to see a test done on single people who have been working remotely for 5+ years and seeing if they have higher levels of general anxiety than anyone working a job where they need to commute full time.<p>Even if you have a private office where you spend 95% of your time alone for ~8 hours, that&#x27;s so much different (arguably better) than not leaving your house or apartment except for occasional short duration activities."
"&quot;Once in a while, I like to indulge in an informative anecdote concerning the genesis of the proof. The criterion was found by the end of 1985; then I remained more than six months making circles around the « splitting tensor ». One nice day of August 1986, I woke up in a camp in Siena and I had got the proof: I therefore sat down and wrote a manuscript of 10 pages. One month later, while recopying this with my typewriter, I discovered that one of my lemmas about imperialism was wrong: no importance, I made another one! This illustrates the fact, neglected by the formalist ideology, that a proof is not the mere putting side by side of logical rules, it is a global perception: since I had found the concept of empire, I had my theorem and the faulty lemma was hardly more than a misprint.&quot;<p>- Jean-Yves Girard, The Blind Spot"

"The compelling idea here is that they convert the output of common shell commands into tabular data that can be manipulated using common operators, so that you don&#x27;t have the remember sorting&#x2F;filtering&#x2F;grouping flags that may be different for every different shell command. So, imagine being able to use the same sorting&#x2F;filtering logic on the output of `ls` as you might on the output of `ps`, and without relying on hacky solutions like pipelines to `grep`, `cut`, and `sort`.<p>It also means shell command output can be easily transposed into JSON and CSV.

"&gt; Better grid management also helped the economics of wind. At times, strong winds can cause wind farms to produce an excess of power relative to demand, causing a farm&#x27;s output to be reduced.<p>I think this part is particularly relevant to the HN community. As we reach higher and higher penetration of renewables on the grid, we will need to dead with the intermittency more and more. A common phrase I hear at utility conferences nowadays is, &quot;We used to forecast load and deploy generation, but in the future, we will be forecasting generation and deploying load.&quot;<p>I think this area will be the next wave of innovation that needs to happen in the energy transition, and it&#x27;s going to be primarily software driven. Smart load management will be key to avoiding huge storage and infrastructure capital expenses. For example, in Hawaii, they are starting to explore new utility business models that don&#x27;t just rely on a fixed rate of return for capital spent.<p>Anyway, as we cross 50%+ penetration of renewables, I think software is going to take a leading roll in connecting and managing everything so we can have the flexibility we need on the grid."

"Most of these comments are about the structural issues with the electoral college.<p>I’m not really concerned about that. What concerns me is this insistence that a popular vote for President in a country of 350M people is a good idea. Does anyone actually believe this? The executive branch these days has essentially become a proxy for what laws one wants passed, and you end up voting accordingly. This might be fine, if the results were restricted to being local - and by the way, the original design of this country accented on exactly that point. But we don’t live in that country anymore, I guess. Now we want more democracy, all the time.<p>So I find it really hard to believe that introducing <i>more</i> “democracy” in a nation as divided and diverse as this one is a good idea. This, I thought, was supposed to be one of the reasons that people wanted to move here ... the whole Federalism thing. Taxes can be different between states. So can Social policy. The extension of this is of course the Electoral College.<p>Spare me the criticism of “slippery slope” but getting rid of the Electoral College seems like we’d be on the road to a government “of the majority, by the majority, and for the majority”. That is categorically absurd, at least in my view.<p>The cynic in me says that the only reason we’re even talking about this is because Trump won in 2016 via the EC. Sure. He did. And Clinton won the “popular vote” because of LA, SF, and NYC.<p>For those in SF (or whatever proxy): do you want folks in Sioux Falls or Fargo making your economic and social policy? No? I didn’t think so. So why is it okay to institute the reverse?<p>The point I’m trying to make here is this country, as diverse as it is, is best run as a distributed network. And centralizing the election of the Executive into a singular popular vote will help destroy what’s left of that network."

"We should all make a concerted effort to get people to stop using Google Play. There are multiple websites which offer apps, including ones where search can be automated.

My wife and I made the move from a 300k city to a 40k city about 45 minutes away.<p>There&#x27;s many reasons we did. Chiefly, it&#x27;s far far cheaper. But also, it&#x27;s calmer and quieter and just a nicer way to live.  What we didn&#x27;t expect to see, which we are absolutely delighted about, is how different childhood seems to get lived in a much smaller city.  There have been roving bands of children on bikes all summer getting into who knows what kind of awesome mischief.<p>We go on completely random drives 3 or 4 times a week, just wandering the city to get to know it better (and get the youngest to nap) and we see kids and young teens all over the place without parents.<p>Anecdotally of course, but I wonder if smaller cities&#x2F;towns lend themselves to a far more trusting, free, safe environment to grow up. When I picture letting my boys, when older, go out on their own, I&#x27;m thinking about the difference between here and where I used to live. The scariest street has 4 lanes total and is a 50km&#x2F;h.  There&#x27;s no rapid transit to smoosh them. There&#x27;s a wonderful central park just one traffic light away.

An algorithm that when applied to a formal model produces a better model.<p>We have ways to formally prove a program 100% correct negating the need for unit tests, but do we have a formal theory on how to modularize code and design things so that they are future proof and remain flexible and understandable to future programmers?

This discusses some more modern features that weren&#x27;t part of AT&amp;T Unix.<p>-  The Design and Implementation of the FreeBSD Operating System (2014) by Marshall Kirk McKusick et al.  I&#x27;ve met &quot;Kirk&quot; in person a few times at USENIX FAST conferences; he&#x27;s not only a great writer, but he is also very friendly and approachable.  This is a well-written text describing FreeBSD 11, including modern features such as ZFS.<p>There are some good Linux kernel books (I&#x27;m partial to &quot;Linux Kernel Development&quot; by Robert Love, which helped me out nine years ago when I was writing a device-mapper device), but what I&#x27;ve found during my experience working with the Linux kernel is that the Linux kernel changes much faster than the books describing it get updated.  Nevertheless, the best thing to do is to get a solid understanding of how Unix works, then get a basic understanding of the Linux kernel, then start diving into the source code, which is ultimately the definitive documentation of the Linux kernel.<p>When I was working on that device-mapper device, I found that perusing the Linux kernel mailing list was excellent for learning about how relevant portions of the kernel changed over time.<p>Good luck and have fun!  I haven&#x27;t done much kernel-level work lately, but I miss working at that level!"

"&gt; Turbo Pascal programs start by calibrating a delay loop (so that the Delay function knows how much to spin to achieve a certain delay). The calibration counts the number of times a certain loop is run for 55ms (as measurable using the PC’s timer interrupt with its default setting), then divides the number of loops by 55 so that Delay can then busy-wait in millisecond increments.<p>Why not use the PC&#x27;s timer interrupt for the delay function itself?"

"I see many fellow Brazilians have already made their points here, but I feel some clarification is due.<p>First of all: forest fires are common here, and they are part of the natural cicle of the forest themselves. The real problem is not the size or count of those fires, but where they are happening. Deforestation has been blatant in Brazil for decades, but years of increased regulation had them on a continuous decreasing trend. Under the new government, however, it has surged again. Some sources mention deforestation areain 2019 might reach double the amount of 2018, although it&#x27;s hard to trust any such information these days due to political appropriation of data and information channels.<p>So with more deforestation, these fires are cutting deeper into the forest, into areas previously not touched by fire, some of which may never recover. As I mentioned: such fires are common, but at the edge of the forest where plant and wildlife are adapted to them. The ecosystem of the deeper jungle is completely different, and species from the edges, when not dead, are forced into areas they did not live before, either in or out of the forest. The impact of this movements is hard to predict, but bound to be disastrous.<p>It would be bad enough if this was related to a more global climate trend or a natural cicle of things. What really hurts though is the fact that many of these fires are, however, intentionally started by people, driven by commercial interest in either developing or farming the land, almost always illegally, and as of recently encouraged by our very government officials.<p>So, yeah, things are pretty bad, but hey have been so for a while and even if the numbers are worse in Angola and Congo, the conjunction of natural and political causes need to be taken into account."

"I understand that policy makers think that low interest rates will encourage people to put their money into investments like the equities or a business by forcing people out of saving.  But, have they ever considered that they may actually be achieving the opposite?  Someone who just turned 65 (like aging Europe), really really needs to save in safe assets.  Negative yielding bonds don&#x27;t change that need!  So, instead of investing in risky assets, they may simply take the negative yield and save even harder to make up for the negative yield thus reducing spending even further and hurting the economy."

"My Lyme story is probably one of the less dramatic posted here, but it is telling that I feel like I was relatively taken good care of compared to many others here and elsewhere. My first symptom was the classic erythema migrans (bullseye rash), which was painful on its own, but given that this was during summertime in southern Italy it got unbearable at times. I saw a doctor who told me I had probably been bitten by a spider or lizard, but nothing to worry about. I asked him about Lyme but he insisted there were no ticks in Italy (!)... Eventually I got low fever and terrible upper joint pains, as well as deformed nails and fingers (the second stage of Lyme). This was still not enough for the doc as again, there are no ticks in Italy... After a short time Bell&#x27;s palsy kicked in (severe facial paralysis and a drastic change in taste in my case) and then I knew that I was 100% dealing with Lyme. So off we go to Italy&#x27;s main institution for infectious diseases where they tap me for an insane amount of blood to analize, and tell me I will stay at the hospital for maybe a week. Tests came back and Lyme was positive, even though there are no ticks in Italy... I ended up staying at the hospital almost two months with antibiotics pumped intravenously multiple times a day for hours. After recovering I had to go to the hospital for health controls every 2-3 months or so for a around a year.<p>And I was lucky enough to go through this during a time where antibiotics are still effective at fighting bacterias. One of my biggest fears is entering a post-antibiotic era, where bacterias grow resistant at a faster rate than we are discovering new antibiotics. If we keep misusing them, to erroneously treat ourselves, to feed livestock, pumping the rest products into rivers, this might not be such a far fetched scenario."

"It&#x27;s comparing apples and oranges to compare medieval peasants life and modern office work. Even today in rural areas people work around the clock in and around the house to keep everything afloat and barely survive. Sitting on your butt for 10h a day and doing intellectual work seems hard only until you try to do some farming for a while - and modern farming is nothing compared to how hard it was back then, when you had to do everything manually, no running water, no electricity, no farming machinery, no supermarkets. They even had to make their own cloths as textile was extremely expensive, and I&#x27;ve read that weaving was one of the activities that was taking any free moment to medieval women, it was extremely time consuming. The pace of life was slower, that for sure, and perhaps the average working hours were indeed shorter (in winter especially because of shorter daylight), but they worked way harder than most people have to today."

"The thing that I like about Duckling is that it is a rules based system, which can easily be interrogated.  Model based text extraction is much harder to fix when there is a bug.  I use Duckling as a service in value extraction from queries and content alongside a model based system for NER (such as spaCy).  Using both together makes for more accurate enrichment in general (by cross referencing between the two for values, and adding exception rules)"

If not, how does it link to them in a single HTML file? If or if so, is there any way to get around it without using MHTML (or have you considered using MHTML in that case)?<p>Also, side-question about Rust: how do I get rid of absolute file paths in the executable to avoid information leakage?

"Something I&#x27;m curious about is why JS developers don&#x27;t have the option to send along some of this information themselves; type information, JS bytecode, etc. Given that we often have it on hand already (TypeScript) or could integrate it into our build process (webpack). Obviously plain JS needs to still work without all that, but it could be a compelling point of optimization for large-scale apps. Perhaps the JS bytecode just isn&#x27;t standardized across browsers?"

"Gates worked as a programmer in high school, so he was aware that the practice of selling software was not new. IBM was a long standing company by that point that made money writing software for businesses.

"&gt;Whereas Java and C users may still have debates about where, exactly, open source projects should publish their releases, that issue is settled in the JavaScript community<p>I thought Maven Central was pretty much the canonical answer in Java land. Nobody cares what tool you actually use to pull these down (SBT, Gradle, Maven..).<p>&gt;What this means, however, is that to do JavaScript development “The Modern Way”, while adopting its new features, you simply must use a local transpiler toolchain<p>Surely this depends on the browsers your application is targeting? And presumably, the sort of feature you&#x27;re using (can it be polyfilled or is it a syntax feature?).<p>&gt;In 2018-2019, several things have changed about the JavaScript community. Development tools are no longer fledgling, but are, instead, mature. There are built-in development tools in all of Safari, Firefox, and Chrome browsers<p>I agree they&#x27;re decent, but there are still cases where they struggle - particularly after code has been transpiled.

"What&#x27;s funny is, despite all the criticism this is getting on Hacker News, this move is probably going to end up doing more to improve the online privacy of the average user than every ad blocker and tracking blocker has combined over the last decade or so.<p>Google, the world largest ad provider and browser vendor, is essentially proposing to tear down the web&#x27;s current free-for-all cookie-based ad targeting and conversion tracking system, and replace it with a privacy-respecting one built on standardized APIs implemented by the user&#x27;s browser. If they&#x27;re even <i>moderately</i> successful at this, it&#x27;s going to be a <i>huge</i> improvement to the current status quo of online advertising from a privacy perspective.<p>For those who haven&#x27;t, read the Chromium blog post on this effort[1] and the associated early proposals[2]. They&#x27;re a lot more concrete about what exactly this new vision entails.<p>And for those cynics who are skeptical of this effort just because of their preconceptions surrounding the company proposing it, consider this: Google has every reason to want to improve the reputation of online advertising. Better, more privacy-respecting ads mean less people blocking ads, which means more revenue for Google. Last year Chrome implemented a built-in ad blocker for a similar reason[3]. Personalized ad targeting doesn&#x27;t have to mean compromises to user privacy, and Google intends to prove it.<p>[1]: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.chromium.org&#x2F;2019&#x2F;08&#x2F;potential-uses-for-privacy-sandbox.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.chromium.org&#x2F;2019&#x2F;08&#x2F;potential-uses-for-privacy...</a><p>[2]: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.chromium.org&#x2F;Home&#x2F;chromium-privacy&#x2F;privacy-sandbox"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.chromium.org&#x2F;Home&#x2F;chromium-privacy&#x2F;privacy-sandb...</a><p>[3]: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.chromium.org&#x2F;2017&#x2F;06&#x2F;improving-advertising-on-web.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.chromium.org&#x2F;2017&#x2F;06&#x2F;improving-advertising-on-w...</a>"

"This reminds me of &quot;suicide linux&quot; (available as a deb and docker image). If you type a typo in a command, it gets converted to rm -rf &#x2F;"
"&gt; To appreciate the absurdity of this argument [about encouraging fingerprinting], imagine the local police saying, “We see that our town has a pickpocketing problem. But if we crack down on pickpocketing, the pickpocketers will just switch to muggings. That would be even worse. Surely you don’t want that, do you?”<p>Actually, fingerprinting is not JUST used to track users for ads. Describing the characteristics of a device is used for lots of other purposes as well. For example canvas size etc etc useful for other reasons. Many &#x2F; most web dev folks rely on fingerprints (user agent &#x2F; screen size) when targeting layouts, adding &#x2F; removing features etc.<p>The whole analogy where police are cracking down on criminals is the same as cracking down on fingerprinting is what is &quot;absurd&quot; and &quot;disingenuous&quot;. A better analogy is wanting to have a 10mph speed limit to reduce pedestrian deaths. It would (and I like car free planning so would support it). But it would ALSO make commutes etc slower."
"When I read the comments of how people are happy with their 2003 model car X, or they drive an old but great manual 1997 model car Y, I get really confused. Safety systems in cars continue to improve, from more and better airbags, to crumple zones, automatic collision braking, pedestrian detection braking, intelligent headlights that don&#x27;t blind oncoming traffic, seatbelts that pre-tension, better traction control, better brakes, blind spot monitoring, backup cameras, etc. A 2020 model car will have more of these features than an older car. It is more likely to keep you and others safe, including pedestrians safe. MPG keeps getting better -- the newer cars are generally nicer overall."
"We built a little B2B startup that involved a lot of technical sales. One thing I realised quite quickly is that if I started arguing with a prospect it would only result in them entrenching their position. Not useful if that position means they won’t buy your product.<p>I think the reason is relatively obvious. When you’re debating, you spend all of your time trying to think of all of the ways your position is the correct one. So it’s not surprising it becomes entrenched.<p>If the outcome you want to drive is the opposite, it’s basically wasted effort."

"OK, so I think a little political context about this would be useful.<p>On September 8th, Russia has &quot;universal voting day&quot;, with elections to different regional parliaments, heads of some regions and even additional members of parliament. This year, the campaign have been very political because of Moscow parliament - which was for years treated as a completely uninteresting event with very low news coverage and turnout. This year, however, in response to opposition candidates getting a serious momentum, many have been disallowed to run, triggering escalating protests - some legal, some illegal, with sometimes brutal reaction to the police, which, in turn, led even more people to take part in the protest. This amount of people in the street haven&#x27;t been seen since 2011 protests.<p>So, after the trust in the elections, rule of law and democracy process have been eroded this much, I&#x27;m genuinely surprised that they even bothered to build a buzzword-fueled voting system."

"Catabolism is another aspect of thinking about code as an organic entity that I find useful. Anabolic (growth) processes and catabolic (teardown) processes always accompany each other in biological systems. Too often we neglect to continually tear down and remove unused aspects of our systems.<p>Both anabolism and catabolism are always operating, though at different rates depending on the environment and needs of the organism. The funny thing is that catabolic processes will happily tear down important parts of the system, forcing them to be anabolicly rebuilt. Things like bone and muscle mass. This seems wasted, but it has an extremely important purpose: uncontrolled anabolism is cancer.<p>I think the analogy to code is obvious. We&#x27;ve all seen codebases that have gotten out of hand (gotten cancer), and part of the reason they got that way is because the growth pressures had no countervailing teardown pressure. The market provides selective pressure in nasty ways: codebases and systems with cancer slow and die, and are replaced by younger codebases without uncontrolled growth.<p>How do we break that cycle? By encouraging catabolic activity culturally within our companies and codebases. Cleanup is incredibly valuable. Functionality that isn&#x27;t being heavily used and is complicating implementation of new work should absolutely be on the chopping block. We don&#x27;t have to be quite as aggressive as biological systems, but we shouldn&#x27;t take their example lightly either.<p>This also provides insight into when cleanup doesn&#x27;t matter: when the survival horizon of the organism is sufficiently short that cancer frankly doesn&#x27;t matter. Startups shouldn&#x27;t worry too much until they have product market fit. Once it&#x27;s clear they&#x27;ll be around for years more though, catabolic work will help ensure future health."

"This assumes that the compiler can actually infer that a const-by-reference isn&#x27;t modified.<p>The second we have indirection (function pointers), or a different source file without whole-program-optimization, or a library, these assumptions break down.<p>Further, the author assumes that the compiler can&#x27;t benefit from the knowledge that something is const because the const can be cached away.

You also need to do this for all the items between the new size and old size every time you resize your item list.<p>Second, safe iteration over all of the bulk data doesn&#x27;t seem possible without adding some sort of flag to indicate whether or not an item is free.<p>Am I missing something here?"

"This isn&#x27;t what they studied, but a simple thought experiment shows a limited use case where traffic absolutely can be helped by speeding things up.<p>Let&#x27;s imagine a world where self driving cars are required for freeway driving; this allows them to respond in a predictable and timely manor with respect to directives to avoid lanes (and not jump the line) as well as to go at an exact speed.<p>An event (accident, whatever) obstructs One of Five possible lanes for use (including the HOV lane) on a section normally rated at 60 MPH.<p>This reduces the capacity of the road by 1&#x2F;5th, or alternately, one lane of flow should be re-distributed across 4 lanes (1&#x2F;4th per lane).<p>Idealized solution: A temporary bypass zone is communicated to the self-driving cars.  There is a lead up zone where the speed is expected to ramp up to the new target, followed by a merge zone where the lanes reduce and the flow is re-shaped to balance traffic evenly.  The cars would then pass the incident zone in this higher speed lane-compressed flow, before expanding out and then slowing back down to normal speed.<p>Due to the unexpected nature of the incident there has also been a buildup of volume before the incident, so to alleviate that slightly higher flow will be allowed to drain the high pressure area.<p>In the above hypothetical case, for 4 out of 5 lanes nornally at 60MPH, I would prefer to imagine: (1 + 1&#x2F;4) * 60MPH =&gt; 75, but round up another 5 MPH for the bypass flow for a total of 80MPH in the corrected flow area.<p>Many sections of freeway could likely support that safely ; they&#x27;re often engineered very well but have conservative speed limits set for political and driver quality reasons.  However some sections would &#x27;cap out&#x27; at a lower actually safe speed; in those sections the above procedure could help minimize the traffic flow impact.<p>However...

Such a long article on reading and teaching and no mention of syllables. Is this completley unrecognized concept in eanglish reading teaching?<p>Teaching kids to read in polish goes like this: letters -&gt; syllables -&gt; words -&gt; sentences (with an overlap of the steps).<p>Known words and sentences are used throughout the process to illustrate the things you are learning at the moment and sort of tease what you will be able to do when you master current step.<p>I imagine in language where same letters can have so many different sounds the concept of syllables should be even more useful.<p>Teaching kids to read sentences before they can recognize what sound which letter bunches mean seems like telling kid to swim before he learns to float or tread water.

"&gt; If Apple releases their new Macs with an identical keyboard, then I&#x27;m ditching Macs and will pick up a Microsoft Surface Book or something similar.<p>Holy shit, I know you&#x27;re desperate but for the sake of your sanity DO NOT buy anything from the Microsoft Surface line.<p>I traded my Surface Book for a Dell XPS a couple of months back and, although the Dell is far from perfect, in day to day use it&#x27;s about 10000x better than the Surface. Key point: it&#x27;s a tool I can rely on.<p>Here are some examples of Surface issues that make it a very poor choice of tool as a &quot;daily driver&quot; machine:<p>- The keyboard is crap: differently crap to the Macbook Pro, but still crap (to be fair this isn&#x27;t the XPS&#x27;s best feature either, but it&#x27;s still better), and I found myself having to correct an unusually large quantity of typos. Layout&#x27;s a bit weird as well, although you do get used to that.<p>- The WiFi sucks: it just drops connectivity all the damn time, or refuses to reconnect, or doesn&#x27;t recognise a network, or whatever. It gets boring. Yes, I&#x27;ve updated the firmware. Yes, I&#x27;ve updated the drivers.<p>- The battery drains <i>fast</i> whilst the computer is asleep. Like between 12 and 16 hours fast. This means if you don&#x27;t have a full charge at the end of the day, and you forget to plug it in overnight, it&#x27;s dead in the morning. My Macbook Pros can sleep for days and wake up; likewise the XPS - no problems with sleep.<p>- Sometimes, even when plugged in, it wouldn&#x27;t charge - no idea why. Sometimes it would charge only one of the batteries (e.g., the one in the keyboard but not the one in the screen, or vice versa) - again, no idea why. Generally required a reboot to fix the latter. I got so tired of this machine letting me down because the battery was dead (for whatever reason).<p>- Battery life is <i>nowhere near</i> advertised levels. I forget what it&#x27;s supposed to be: 11 hours, 13 hours, 16 hours? It doesn&#x27;t matter. If you&#x27;re doing any kind of serious work you&#x27;ll be luck to get 3 - 4.<p>- Related to the above, the fans are always running and the thing runs really hot even in cool or temperate environments.<p>- Dumb power supply design with too-short cables (yes, you can buy generic replacements that are longer) and a fragile connector to the machine itself.<p>(If the above sounds really angry it&#x27;s because that computer made me <i>really</i> angry on a regular basis. Without doubt the worst and least reliable machine I have ever owned, with the exception of two Sinclair Spectrums back in the 1980s. Do not buy one unless you&#x27;re into more creative methods of self-flagellation.)<p>If I had to pick a machine now because, like you, I&#x27;m not going to buy another MBP[1] unless this keyboard fiasco is sorted out, it would probably be a mid-level to high end Lenovo. They seem pretty decent and offer plenty of options for customisation, depending on which range you pick.<p><i>[1] I&#x27;m still using a 2015 model, which is doing mostly fine, although one day it will need replacing.</i>"

"TLDR; some research requires couple of decades to bear the fruit but people in power, especially in industrial labs don’t have much patience.<p>I don’t see any new insights. This is very well known fact. Typically industrial labs starts with lot of fan fare about long term view, big bets, blue sky research, don’t worry about business impact etc. Eventually after few years or decades, people starts counting money spent vs money earned. Then suddenly you have research evaluation meetings where you have to justify everything in terms of business impact. I think this is the life cycle of industrial labs."

"Right or wrong, the only thing that matters is the constitution.<p>It is easy to imagine that a purely democratic system would be better, but I find it easy to imagine that it would be substantially worse.<p>The founding fathers rightly believed that most people were ignorant and relatively stupid so the people vote for the house, but senators and electors were appointed.<p>The agreement to get small states to join was that they would have an equal number of senators. If you want a different system change the constitution. Im skeptical that a democratic system would be better.<p>They setup the system to be a collection of states with a weak federal govt with limited power. The federal govt over time has taken more and more power from the states.<p>When california joined the union it had 33X less population than the most populous state (new york). Californians were happy to have the overrepresentation when it benefitted them.<p>Overall a strongly federal system is worse than a system where 50 states each try something different. In a 50 state system we get many chances to find the best policies. For example when marijuana is illegal at the federal level the antis predicted wholesale mayhem. There was no way to test to see what would happen until some states defied federal law. Once one state showed that it was fine others could come on board.<p>The same goes for open carry. Antis claimed there would massive increases in crime and shootings. It turns out not to be the case."

"Online communication greatly suffers from lack of context. When you talk to someone face to face a lot of the message is coming from the body language and the tone of the voice, this makes it clear when the person is joking, serious, naive, confused or whatever reason to look in disagreement with you in a written online conversation. This keeps things from escalating most of the time. Not online.<p>The measures I took for myself:
- ignore conversations with lower importance.<p>- argue with people I know, I trust they are smart enough to understand the discussion and interesting enough to communicate with. Ignore strangers, there is always some stranger that is wrong on Internet, it does not matter, it is not your job to &quot;fix&quot; it<p>- read several times before answering and read my answer several times before pushing the button if the discussion is heated<p>- take in consideration cultural differences. I find even this place very different for me (Eastern Europe), I see myself downvoted for apparently no reason (but there is one, I guess), I see opinions that look strange or even outrageous - I figured out most of these are due to cultural differences. Diversity in not what we wish to be, not yet (diversity in opinions)."

"I have dreams of Wikidata eventually being leveraged to enable similar interactivity. Currently Wikidata can store plenty of information, but there&#x27;s no reason it shouldn&#x27;t keep growing. Right now items already often have dates and coordinates - creating interactive maps and timelines is theoretically just a matter of implementation. Ideally, though, I want Wikidata to be so much more: why shouldn&#x27;t it contain historical weather data? TV listings? Sports results? Having all of this available in an open and structured format would make all sorts of things possible, and I think we&#x27;re only scratching the surface.<p>The other big &quot;problem&quot; with Wikipedia is copyright (and it&#x27;s certainly not Wikipedia&#x27;s fault), but there&#x27;s a surprising amount of public domain work (thanks to many governments, especially the US) and of course tons of user-submitted work that ranges from bad to incredible.

"First off, parking isn&#x27;t flat &amp; spread out. It is very often stacked &amp; condensed into compact areas known parking garages, some of which sit under housing complexes and so take up no extra real estate at all. Presenting the square acreage of all parking spaces like this is a grossly misleading way of presenting the data. 10% of the raw acreage of <i>spaces</i> is very much <i>not</i> 10% of the real estate used for parking.<p>Second, there <i>have</i> to be many more parking places than there are cars, otherwise you would never be able to move your car. You wouldn&#x27;t find another spot, because it would already be taken.<p>Third, even if we imagine a perfect system where you leave your spot, someone leaves their spot and takes your spot, leaving an opening for you, that would still ignore the fact that parking spots are not fungible. You can&#x27;t interchange them, one spot for another, and balance the equation. The spot in front of your house&#x2F;appartment is pretty much useless for nearly everyone else that isn&#x27;t a neighbor.<p>I don&#x27;t have any comprehensive solution to this problem, but what I am pretty sure of is that there&#x27;s no single silver bullet solution that will massively improve the situation.

"Nice. Although it&#x27;s not mentioned, it seems like the insight here is partially about the lingering effects on the API of one model of persistence?<p>A log is normally considered a stream that&#x27;s too large to keep in memory and needs to be incrementally persisted to disk on the fly, in timestamp order. (Or at least, the traditional file-based way does that, which affects the API.) But each HTTP request happens in memory and its log could be kept there.<p>A downside might be if the server crashes in the middle of a request, the request is entirely unlogged?

Having been a programmer in the 1980&#x27;s, a lot of what we did was making it up as we went along since there were no precedents (and no easy communications like the internet today to know if someone else did it before). In 1955 Disney had no computers or cell phones or CAD or anything we take for granted. Despite the opening day disasters, today it&#x27;s a huge business. DisneyWorld in Orlando by itself as a separate company would be in the middle of the Fortune 500."

"I&#x27;ve learned that it&#x27;s very hard to convince people online, particularly over social media (ie twitter), because either 1) these people are unwilling to openly admit that they are wrong because their &#x27;expertise&#x27; in the topic will be questioned and they will lose social status value 2) these people think it&#x27;s weakness to openly admit that they are wrong so they will insist they are correct in order to try to keep up their &#x27;image&#x27; 3) these people are simply convinced that they are correct and therefore won&#x27;t change their ability to be convinced otherwise"

"Speaking of looking like crap, I was recently going through my old backups, and ran across an ancient forgotten installer for &quot;The Sims Steering Committee&quot; dated June 4, 1998, an early pre-release version of The Sims that we distributed internally at EA shortly after they bought Maxis, more than a year and a half before we released The Sims in March 2000.<p>Here&#x27;s a screen recording of a demo I made in a VM, which walks through the scenarios, objects, and tools, and also shows some of the &quot;SimAntics&quot; behavior tree code behind the different levels.<p><a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=zC52jE60KjY"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=zC52jE60KjY</a><p>It&#x27;s got a &quot;sketchy&quot; user interface, a dot above the selected character&#x27;s head instead of the iconic spinning plumb-bob, a horrifically crude and ugly object placement tool with yellow squares and big red X&#x27;s when you can&#x27;t place an object (but that gladly lets you place bathtubs on hills), and a bare minimal number of crappy objects, some of which have astoundingly terrible graphics and prototypically implemented behaviors.<p>Especially @ 24:25: the vintage Stereo with colorful musical notes dancing above it, the stinky Fish Tank (permanently attached to its own table), the unbelievably nasty Pink Flamingo, the goofy looking Flower (also growing out of a pot on its own table), and the blue bakelite Telephone (glued to its own table as well) which looks like it has Halloween Candy Corn springing out when it rings @ 12:45, then the caller asks you if you&#x27;d like your fingers chewed off by rabid ferrets for $42. It has pixelated censoring @ 13:31, which attempts to disguise the embarrassing fact that they shit and shower with their pants on. Also @ 2:00 it has weird pie menus with placeholder programmer art, and the original characters, including Archie Bunker permanently holding a burning cigar in his hand! Also there&#x27;s some unfortunately worded dialog text that probably wouldn&#x27;t have made it past the ESRB @ 40:50.<p>As ugly as it was, it was just playable enough to convince The Sims Steering Committee at EA not to cancel our project, and to give us another year and a half to complete it.<p>Here&#x27;s an interview with Chris Trottier, one of the designers of The Sims, in which she describes &quot;Tuned Emergence and Design by Accretion&quot;.<p>Sims Designer Chris Trottier on Tuned Emergence and Design by Accretion<p><a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20110408034710&#x2F;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.donhopkins.com&#x2F;drupal&#x2F;node&#x2F;31"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20110408034710&#x2F;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.donho...</a><p>&gt;The Armchair Empire interviewed Chris Trottier, one of the designers of The Sims and The Sims Online. She touches on some important ideas, including &quot;Tuned Emergence&quot; and &quot;Design by Accretion&quot;.<p>&gt;Chris&#x27; honest analysis of how and why &quot;the gameplay didn&#x27;t come together until the months before the ship&quot; is right on the mark, and that&#x27;s the secret to the success of games like The Sims and SimCity.<p>&gt;The essential element that was missing until the last minute was tuning: The approach to game design that Maxis brought to the table is called &quot;Tuned Emergence&quot; and &quot;Design by Accretion&quot;. Before it was tuned, The Sims wasn&#x27;t missing any structure or content, but it just wasn&#x27;t balanced yet. But it&#x27;s OK, because that&#x27;s how it&#x27;s supposed to work!<p>&gt;In justifying their approach to The Sims, Maxis had to explain to EA that SimCity 2000 was not fun until 6 weeks before it shipped. But EA was not comfortable with that approach, which went against every rule in their play book. It required Will Wright&#x27;s tremendous stamina to convince EA not to cancel The Sims, because according to EA&#x27;s formula, it would never work.<p>&gt;If a game isn&#x27;t tuned, it&#x27;s a drag, and you can&#x27;t stand to play it for an hour. The Sims and SimCity were &quot;designed by accretion&quot;: incrementally assembled together out of &quot;a mass of separate components&quot;, like a planet forming out of a cloud of dust orbiting around star. They had to reach critical mass first, before they could even start down the road towards &quot;Tuned Emergence&quot;, like life finally taking hold on the planet surface. Even then, they weren&#x27;t fun until they were carefully tuned just before they shipped, like the renaissance of civilization suddenly developing science and technology. Before it was properly tuned, The Sims was called &quot;the toilet game&quot;, for the obvious reason that there wasn&#x27;t much else to do!<p>Chris Trottier (Sims Online) Q&amp;A<p><a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20111211182436&#x2F;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.armchairempire.com&#x2F;Interviews&#x2F;chris-trottier-the-sims.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20111211182436&#x2F;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.armcha...</a><p>&gt;Q: On paper, a game where you simulate daily life doesn&#x27;t sound that interesting. Yet The Sims is really fun to play, so much so that it is now the biggest-selling PC game ever. Although any development team working with Will Wright has to feel confident in the product they are creating, has the unbelievable popularity of the franchise shocked even the development team?<p>&gt;A: Absolutely. When I was first assigned to The Sims, it was not-very-affectionately-known within the company as &quot;the toilet game.&quot; Will Wright had tremendous stamina for the risk involved with trying something very new, but there were certainly a lot of head-scratchers both on the team and outside of it. In all honesty, the gameplay didn&#x27;t start to really come together until a couple of months before ship. Being involved in that tuning process, and seeing the game take shape from what had previously been a mass of separate components, was one of the most powerful experiences of my career."
"Government ruined child hood, in particular over zealous DFACs units have ruined parenthood as well to education where a child not being supervised is a child not enjoying themselves.<p>Seriously, when did we come to the belief that children need structured activities all the time. Easy answer, when government employees stepped in. When politicians and government employees decided they knew better than parents or children what children needed. After all parents might not impart values that politicians decided are correct!<p>Then comes DFACS and the police state to bully parents into complying because the power of state arrayed against them is so one sided that the only chance you have is to surrender your parental rights or be stupid rich enough to fight back."

"&gt; “We like features that improve both power and performance,” Clark elaborated. “Being on the right path more often is important because the worst use of power is executing instructions that you are just going to throw away.

"Mindfulness meditation is absolutely great, a miracle, a root.

"A good artist will make anything look good, pixel art, card games, all the way to photo-real 3d (of course depending on the artist). What happens is that in general the first thing to be cut due to budget is probably the art since without function you have no game. Imho, indie games would do better if they &quot;sliced&quot; their game releases differently, such that art was never takes a back-seat as it is probably tempting to do. Many people think you only need good gameplay but in reality the art, aesthetics, music, etc. of any game is the invisible factor that people are influenced and only notice when it&#x27;s broken."

"I’ve got the same experience as many other posters here and have been buying less from Amazon lately.<p>One thing I haven’t seen people talking about much is how profound and impact Apple Pay is for direct online retail.<p>I used to find products on a company website and then go to Amazon to buy, mainly so I didn’t need to create yet another account, and because of prime shipping and Amazon’s return policy.<p>The amazing thing with Apple Pay is how much it creates an even better purchasing experience than Amazon’s “one-click,” while being open to any merchant. You don’t have to create an account, put in your shipping or billing info, or do anything really. You just click “buy with Apple Pay,” and click to confirm.<p>Between that, and offering “free shipping” (just include it in the product price), and a good return policy, I see retailers being much more able to sell direct and compete with Amazon’s fading reputation."

"This looks nice, but when you say &quot;you&#x27;ll enjoy using&quot; it sounds like the &quot;you&quot; is a salesperson. As an enterprise software PM who works with a lot of CRMs from a partnership&#x2F;integration perspective, I can tell you that whether or not salespeople like it doesn&#x27;t matter.<p>CRMs are tools for sales managers (and folks further up in the hierarchy) to know what&#x27;s going on in their org. An incidental benefit is that reps have useful views of what&#x27;s going on with their prospects, but ease of use for them is just not a concern of the buyer (hence the wild success of Salesforce, which just sucks to use).<p>In some categories of enterprise software, ease of use is a benefit. I was at Box in the early days when one of the big value props is that people would actually use it, because at the time they were using unsanctioned tools like Dropbox. The issue there was that managers didn&#x27;t have an easy well of telling when people were using those tools, so the idea that good UX would entice users to stick with company-approved software was a good selling point.<p>With CRMs, that&#x27;s not the case. As a rep, you&#x27;re judged on your performance, and the way people see your performance is via the information you put in your CRM. If you&#x27;re tracking a bunch of leads outside of your CRM, your manager will know (because you have to keep them in the loop on your deals). Thus, there&#x27;s no reason for sales management to be concerned about ease of use - their CRM is going to get used because the alternative is that the reps are going to get fired.<p>My impression based on your marketing pages and this post is that you didn&#x27;t really take the time to understand the CRM market and buyers before you built this. Your $49&#x2F;month for a whole team pricing structure makes no sense - companies are absolutely willing to pay more (and are very willing to pay per user). Having a price point that low is more likely to scare off serious buyers than entice them. The fact that all of your messaging is directed at a rep is a huge problem. You need to focus on things that matter to your buyers (reporting, lead routing, pipeline management, etc.). &quot;Wobaka is the CRM system that will make you smile&quot; is a bad tagline - the folks buying this don&#x27;t care if the people using it smile. They care about money. If your product doesn&#x27;t make money (by improving time to close and&#x2F;or likelihood of close), then they&#x27;re not buying it whether people smile or not.<p>The good news is you&#x27;ve solicited this feedback early, and the fact that you have a well-designed UI definitely isn&#x27;t a bad thing. If I were you, though, I would stop development and spend most of your time getting this in front of people in sales management to see what their feedback is. Find out what problems they have with their existing CRMs and try to solve those."

What you&#x27;re really looking for however is not <i>logging</i>, what you&#x27;re looking for is <i>observability</i> which has 3 pillars:<p>- Logs<p>- Metrics<p>- Tracing and&#x2F;or APM<p>The above are true for systems and applications but let&#x27;s talk applications. Your decision should be based on assessment of at leat the following:<p>- Do you have compliance requirements? (e.g. GDPR)<p>- What is your logs&#x2F;metrics&#x2F;traces retention period? (let&#x27;s assume 30 days)<p>- What is your logs&#x2F;metrics&#x2F;traces lifecycle requirements? (are you going to need logs older the 30 days? If not, I&#x27;d say don&#x27;t bother delete everything, keeping them around has managerial and hosting costs)<p>I advice to take a look at ElasticSearch:<p>- ElasticSearch for hosting logs<p>- For sending logs, metrics and tracer you can use filebeat, metricbeat and ElasticSearch APM or Jaeger.<p>If you are a small startup, I&#x27;d say go with ElasticSearch Cloud and use their tools. They do all you need and more.<p>[1]: I prefer metricbeat over prometheus&#x2F;grafana because it solves the high availability headache for those who already have an ES cluster and you don&#x27;t have to support (setup, monitor, manage, scale) an additional stack.

"Yes! I am especially interested in multiple currency support. Most budgeting software doesn&#x27;t provide this well or at all. Some questions:<p>* Is each transaction stored in its currency, or is everything converted to a main currency when stored? The latter is lossy and problematic.<p>* Does the app expect each currency to have a fixed exchange rate? If it does, that&#x27;s problematic.<p>* You are asked to select a primary currency when signing up. Can you change the primary currency later? Will any information be lost if you do?<p>* How do you handle transfers from one bank account in one currency to another bank account in another currency? Will it handle an exchange rate that is different from the one the app might be expecting?<p>* How does budgeting work in multiple currencies, how are fluctuating exchange rates used?<p>I&#x27;ll definitely be trying this out regardless of whether I get an answer here, I am really excited about the potential. :)"

"We see that Martin Fowler is influenced by Ralph Johnson in deriving for himself a definition of architecture. In particular,<p><i>there was no objective way to define what was fundamental, or high level</i><p>And goes on to lean heavily on the idea that ‘application architecture&#x27; is a social construct. But I am then left with a thought that if application architecture is a social construct, that means there should be identifiable social characteristics that make-up the application architecture, characteristics that can be further quantified to an acceptable degree, such that they can be defined as fundamental.<p>Taking a step back from Martin’s influence &amp; conclusion, and ask ourselves, “couldn’t software architecture, or architecture in general, be defined by a set of heuristics that lead to objectively defining what is fundamental to a particular context?“<p>Suppose we create three rules that need to be defined before reaching our conclusion:<p>- context: what scale does the architecture in question reference?<p>- collection of computing elements: what are the computing elements (this can range from machines to software)<p>- connectedness: how are the computing elements connected?<p>For example, in order to determine the architecture of my web scraping local machine setup I would go through the rules:<p>- context: a single script file with code written to accomplish the task<p>- collection: functions that are used to perform the task of scraping the webpage<p>- connectedness: functions pass data to other functions to perform specific tasks of scraping<p>In this example we have a guide to achieve objectively what is fundamental to our architecture."

"Why can&#x27;t we have both security as well as court ordered access. What would be the problems if we had 5 HSM that are airgapped and located at secure facilities. Encrypted applications (such as WhatsApp, Apple Messenger, etc) are required to submit&#x2F;transmit escrow keys that are encrypted with the public keys of those 5 HSM&#x27;s. After a valid court order, a law enforcement official has to physically go to one of the secure locations with those encrypted escrow keys which will then be decrypted by the HSM.

"&gt; I think a big problem is you grab a library and you really have no idea what you&#x27;ve gotten. Maybe it has a label. It says it&#x27;s 1.2, but you don&#x27;t know which functions inside it have changed, or why. You don&#x27;t actually know what you&#x27;re running. And maybe the jar file or artifact tells you something about the source that was used to produce it, but the process that was used to produce it is often opaque. And any of that could be wrong because there&#x27;s a lot of human steps involved in producing artifacts. And because so many people use Git, I&#x27;d like to get closer to leveraging some of the features there, in particular using SHA&#x27;s and content-based addressing to talk about things.<p>&gt; I had worked on a library called Codeq, which we&#x27;ll have a new version of soon, that sort of extends the Git model down to the function level, so you would have SHA&#x27;s for individual functions, and you could have dependencies on functions, instead of on artifacts. So a lot of work is happening around that, and some of that manifests itself in this dependency tool."

Nice to see NYT engaging in clickbait headlines.
"The article has examples of array parameters like<p><pre><code>    int b[const 42][24][*]
</code></pre>
but you can get more fun with variably modified array parameters instead of just constants like 42. For example,<p><pre><code>    double sum_a_weird_shaped_matrix(int n, double array[n][3*n]) {
        double total = 0;
        for (int x = 0; x &lt; n; ++x) {
            for (int y = 0; y &lt; 3 * n; ++y) {
                total += array[x][y];
            }
        }
        return total;
    }
</code></pre>
has a variable and a more complicated expression in those positions.<p>But those variably modified parameters can have arbitrary expressions in them, like<p><pre><code>    int last(size_t len, int array[restrict static (printf(&quot;getting the last element of an array of %zu ints\n&quot;, len), len--)]) {
        return array[len];

"&gt; “You’ve got a guy shooting heroin on the street, and the cop is supposed to say, ‘You O.K.?’” grumbled one law enforcement officer in Seattle.

"Yes, there is just so much, and it is not thoroughly documented. &quot;BPF maps&quot; in particular are a) a special feature of a special feature that&#x27;s Linux-specific, not anything that generalizes across OSes, and b) a feature for userspace anyway, not for kernel internals. But even longstanding kernel-internal features aren&#x27;t well documented (e.g., the other day I was trying to figure out what struct file&#x27;s f_version does, and I think there&#x27;s genuinely no docs for it.) So honestly I think the answer there is to not feel bad about not knowing everything.<p>The basic trick of dealing with the kernel is becoming comfortable working in a large codebase most of which you don&#x27;t understand, and figuring out how to find what you need. Honestly, git grep is one of the best tools here. Get some practice finding some specific thing and where it&#x27;s implemented, e.g., find a syscall (git grep SYSCALL.*foo) and trace what it calls. Find the definition of a structure inside include&#x2F; and see who uses it. Get comfortable with the kernel&#x27;s OO-ish system of operations structs, and get some practice tracing both &quot;this function makes a generic call, here&#x27;s a sample driver that implements it&quot; and &quot;this is an implementation of a generic function, here&#x27;s the syscall that calls it.&quot;<p>Beyond that, reading <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lwn.net"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lwn.net</a> &#x27;s articles is invaluable, partly for the clear prose coverage and partly for the breadth of what they talk about.

Again, you&#x27;re not going to follow exactly why e.g. Google wants a new syscall for &quot;restartable sequences&quot; on your first read, but you&#x27;ll get a sense of what is involved in adding a syscall, how various concurrency models work, what other kernel features are relevant, etc.<p>What sort of OS concepts are you finding yourself Googling? I will say that actually doing a college OS class is what made things like virtual memory management click in my head. It&#x27;s an intensive approach but writing code in a much smaller kernel than Linux is a valuable way to understand concepts without being drowned in real-world optimizations and edge cases and portability."

When you reconstruct the daily life of this vanished community, two months of difference are important. We now have the lost piece of a jigsaw puzzle.”</i><p>Inscription: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thumbs-prod.si-cdn.com&#x2F;b-AKU2VJ_IfsLSz6vS4uxPtuRAQ=&#x2F;fit-in&#x2F;1072x0&#x2F;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;public-media.si-cdn.com&#x2F;filer&#x2F;e3&#x2F;4b&#x2F;e34bda47-c893-408b-9627-8e89a21bb921&#x2F;sep2019_b01_pompeii.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thumbs-prod.si-cdn.com&#x2F;b-AKU2VJ_IfsLSz6vS4uxPtuRAQ=&#x2F;...</a><p>I can picture the situation.

"I&#x27;m new to the wider development field so I&#x27;m pretty ignorant to the dynamics of how things work right now or what it takes to maintain an open source project; how come a bounty system isn&#x27;t more prevalent?<p>I know bountysource exists, but I rarely see it brought up.<p>Wouldn&#x27;t work for all packages or projects, but for the ones with big corporate use that are still being developed, it seems like a straight forward way to have a project be more self sustaining vs hoping ppl decide to donate.<p>Seems like a decent first step towards a wider system that could track what packages you use, or that you manually list, with each package or project having a monthly &quot;sustainability goal&quot; set by the maintainer. So that critical packages used by everyone can have more visibility and a more dynamic support system with lower barrier between the maintainer and the wider community. I&#x27;ve always felt that the &quot;subscription&quot; model of things like patreon or similar is too much of a mental commitment for most ppl. Besides, my needs change month to month, and so would what I want to support. Having wider &quot;sustainability&quot; goals with an easy way to donate to them would encourage me to efficiently support the projects I find most useful or inspiring to me. Basically having the data and seeing what projects that are important to me and are currently short funded, and also having an easy system to directly support them without long term commitments.<p>It&#x27;s that visibility of the current state of different foss projects that I feel needs to be addressed, before any creative solutions on monetization can really be layered on top."
"&gt; But in 1967, three physicists at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem realized that when the core of a dying star is very heavy, it won’t gravitationally collapse into a black hole. Instead, the star will undergo a “pair-instability supernova,” an explosion that totally annihilates it in a matter of seconds, leaving nothing behind. “The star is completely dispersed into space,” the three physicists wrote.<p>Does this mean that maybe the big bang was just a unstable pair that did what they describe?"
"Corporations are just people, the same as countries are just people. To think that they operate apart from the decisions of their leaders and members is just silly.

The self is out of the equation.<p>The strongest manifestations of this (to me) are the perceived hypocrisy of proponents of this change. For example believe everyone should pay more in taxes without voluntarily paying more than the minimum themselves. Insist on inane doomsday climate predictions but also fight vehemently against nuclear power and jet travel for vacations without a care. List goes on.<p>Our problem as a society always seems to be those pesky other people and never ourselves."

"I respect that. Crappiness is an underrated quality. I watched an interview with Barry Jenkins recently where he talked about his first short film. He talked about how the film had bad exposure, scratches on the film, weird color, etc. But at the same time, he still loved it, simply due to its uniqueness and rawness.<p>There&#x27;s this assumption that every artist wants to mimic the big budget people. Or not even big budget, just medium budget. That filmmakers want to make movies which are shiny and polished. But a filmmaker who tries to imitate a big budget production with a shoestring budget isn&#x27;t going to get a polished film at a tenth the budget. They&#x27;re gonna get a weird uncanny valley, kinda good looking film that isn&#x27;t quite indie, isn&#x27;t quite mainstream. And trust me, as a begrudging attendee of many small film festivals, it&#x27;s not a good look.<p>Contrast that to say, Stranger Than Paradise, which is remarkably simple and very obviously low budget. It&#x27;s in black and white. The acting is a little rough around the edges. The sets are extraordinarily simple. The camera doesn&#x27;t do anything fancy. Yet it works because it takes full advantage of its crappiness. It doesn&#x27;t half ass quality, it full asses crappiness."

"&gt; Surprisingly, the root cause of bad software has less to do with specific engineering choices, and more to do with how development projects are managed. The worst software projects often proceed in a very particular way:<p>&gt; The project owners start out wanting to build a specific solution and never explicitly identify the problem they are trying to solve. ...<p>At this point, it looks like the article will reveal specific techniques for problem identification. Instead, it wraps this nugget in a lasagna of other stuff (hiring good developers, software reuse, the value of iteration), without explicitly keeping the main idea in the spotlight at all times.<p>Take the first sentences in the section &quot;Reusing Software Lets You Build Good Things Quickly&quot;:<p>&gt; Software is easy to copy. At a mechanical level, lines of code can literally be copied and pasted onto another computer. ...<p>By the time the author has finished talking about open source and cloud computing, it&#x27;s easy to have forgotten the promise the article seemed to make: teaching you how to identify the problem to be solved.<p>The section returns to this idea in the last paragraph, but by then it&#x27;s too little too late:<p>&gt; You cannot make technological progress if all your time is spent on rebuilding existing technology. Software engineering is about building automated systems, and one of the first things that gets automated away is routine software engineering work. The point is to understand what the right systems to reuse are, how to customise them to fit your unique requirements, and fixing novel problems discovered along the way.<p>I would re-write this section by starting with a sentence that clearly states the goal - something like:<p>&quot;Paradoxically, identifying a software problem will require your team to write software. But the software you write early will be quite different than the software you put into production. Your first software iteration will be a guess, more or less, designed to elicit feedback from your target audience and will deliberately built in great haste. Later iterations will solve the real problem you uncover and will emphasize quality. Still, you cannot make technical progress, particularly at the crucial fact-gathering stage, if all your time is spent on rebuilding existing technology. Fortunately, there are two powerful sources of prefabricated software you can draw from: open source and cloud computing.&quot;<p>The remainder of the section would then give specific examples, and skip the weirdly simpleminded introductory talk.<p>More problematically, though, the article lacks an overview of the process the author will be teaching. Its lack makes the remaining discussion even harder to follow. I&#x27;ll admit to guessing the author&#x27;s intent for the section above.<p>Unfortunately, the entire article is structured so as to prevent the main message (&quot;find the problem first&quot;) from getting through. As a result, the reader is left without any specific action to take today. S&#x2F;he might feel good after having read the article, but won&#x27;t be able to turn the author&#x27;s clear experience with the topic into something that prevents more bad software from entering the world."
Fun fact: there is exactly one situation in the United States in which you are required to fly with non-TSA approved locks on your luggage.

I am willing to forgo a couple pennies in interest on my rolling $15-20 balance to have the convenience of mobile ordering.<p>If you use the system efficiently, I see it as a net value add as a customer."

"Here are some hard economic truths. Both parents work. That’s a big part of it. Women have joined men in the corporate workforce and are encouraged to work 10 hour days and move up the corporate ladder. This together with automation and outsourcing and trickle down economics (eg lower capital gains tax than income tax) has contributed to wage stagnation. In the past, taking care of children was indirectly valued economically, because in many households, there was a division of labor and only one parent was available to work for the market.<p>So now it takes both parents to pay the same rent that one breadwinner could pay before. Now that both parents are trading a large part of their time to work for corporations instead of taking care of kids, most of the kids are being put in a public school - it has become essentially a glorified daycare center to watch the kids while the parents work. So the work is outsourced to professionals in the school zoned for their residence (nevermind failing schools). They are told to sit down and shut up for 8-10 hours a day. The teachers are told not to do anything rash if the kids act out. There is not much they can do to stop it. The kids that are too troublesome are put in special ed and&#x2F;or medicated with ADD medications that are chemically similar to methamphetamines.<p>Working adults also do this to their parents sometimes, putting them in nursing homes which keep them medicated if they are too anxious.<p>Sadly, it gets worse. There is an opioid epidemic among men and a quarter of middle aged women are taking antidepressants. People are lonely, often living alone without family or village, getting amazon or food deliveries, speaking for 5 seconds with the delivery person, and no one knows most of their neighbors.<p>We in the US need to have a hard look at our society instead of medicating everyone.<p>A major step forward would be a UBI and a 30 hour workweek. Men AND women can be amazing parents to their children and caretakers to their own parents if given the chance economically.<p>PS: And the animals too, we need to end factory farming and overuse of antibiotics and thinking it’s ok. This is a sick society."

This is advice for myself as well.  A) realise the people on the other side of the chat can be anyone.  Literally anyone.  So don’t be offended by them or try to teach them anything.  You could later find out you are jsut as wrong.  B) keep composure and be nice to them.  Nothing disarms a person than being nice and having manners.  C) people that are usually rude and aggressive only are just defensive about their own insecurities.  It might be hiding something deeper and they are using you as a reflection board.<p>I still have a lot of trouble controlling myself but I am getting better.  I think all these instant gratification of social media has made us trigger happy; especially platforms like twitter.

"One of the most annoying things about my BMW 535 is onboard electronics. The car is only 4 years old, but it already doesn&#x27;t even work with bluetooth properly: map directions stop audio playback as they should, but then fail to actually come through the speakers. Next time I buy a car I will be extra anal about the entertainment system. For any kind of extended commute the ability to have directions _and_ audiobooks&#x2F;music working properly at the same time is more critical to me than just about any other aspect of the car, excluding reliability and safety.<p>And car manufacturers should at this point get on with the program and offer proper software updates.

"I&#x27;m sorry, but I&#x27;ll have to state my discontent with your product. Firstly, I question it&#x27;s usability from the beginning. How accurate is it? Can you get something similar to a BAC with it? Also how often&#x2F;likely is it that a false positive will happen? More importantly I fear that the &quot;Cannabis Breathalyzer&quot; will become like a polygraph, which can&#x27;t tell whether your actually lying or not, but is merely used as a tool by police that&#x27;s used against people. Comparing Alcohol to Cannabis also isn&#x27;t right. These are <i>vastly</i> different chemicals with different effects on people. Over ~10000 people died in 2017 from alcohol impaired driving[0], can anything remotely similar be said of Cannabis? Don&#x27;t get me wrong driving under the influence of any drug can be dangerous, and is why on most prescription bottles you&#x27;ll have a &quot;Do not operate heavy machinery&quot; warning on it, but that doesn&#x27;t stop everyone on medication from driving. Prohibiting Cannabis has caused much grief in the past that this tool, without accurate results and proper use, is likely going to cause more harm than good.

"How does this perception mechanism fit in with how people conceptualize or register numbers?<p>A friend was telling me that when she thinks of a number, a particular visualization of it automatically comes into her mind.  From how she described it, I recall thinking it sounded like an accidental approximation of something like a logarithmic scale, but less direct and less precise than it had to be.  I knew her pretty well, and, other than this visual, she didn&#x27;t appear atypical (was social, smart and educated, but no savant superpowers, nor any unusually low limits).<p>I was wondering whether she had a normal human conception of numbers, and somehow just had a little extra introspection on that.

"One of the most poignant and evocative things I&#x27;ve read of late. I don&#x27;t want to spoil the experience if you plan to read, so just two  excerpts.<p>&gt; <i>What I learned from the book is that the differences between the back and front row are more than money, marginality, jobs, and education.  That is, the back row kids chose lives and educations that weren’t going to get them fancy jobs and high salaries, and they did it only partly because their schools and towns and society hedged them in.  They also chose the lives that were going to keep them close to their communities, their families.  I believe that, I’ve seen it.  And it’s admirable.</i><p>&gt; <i>Looking back I had never expected to have my atheism challenged. Certainly not in the drug dens of the South Bronx, but that is what happened. Part of it was recognizing a simply utilitarian value in faith. It was a more informed scientific view of religion. The realization that what the cold secular world that science so often offers up is just that, Cold &amp; secular. Science is not very appealing and often hard for those dealing with trauma to see what “good” it offers. [...] It became a realization that being educated and wealthy had removed me from the best evidence for the “truth” behind faith. When you shield yourself from the messy details of life it is easy to convince yourself that humans can figure it all out, that we all got it under control, or that with enough data, thinking, and computer power, we could figure it out. Maybe, just maybe, we couldn’t and can’t ever do so. Maybe there is stuff just too big and complex to understand and perhaps that is the essential truth.</i><p>--<p>Succinctly illustrates something that is a complete blind spot for the mythical &quot;Silicon Valley&quot;, with it&#x27;s mood of techno-optimism and focus on &quot;technology&quot; (sic software). I&#x27;m sure reality is much more nuanced even for people with one foot in this bubble. I don&#x27;t want to kickstart a cliched thread so we can all pile on SV, but I wonder how (where from) others here get such broader perspective in life. It would also be great to hear from people in very different circumstances &amp; geography, about how they manage their intellectual interests and their human side."

"Most of these are similar manifestations of the same root evil (not specific to Microsoft): Users don’t want Feature X but Company wants users to want Feature X. They release Feature X to the world. It’s a failure—nobody uses it. The PM or developers who invested in that feature need to justify the investment. So they make Feature X enabled by default. Users disable it. So they remove the disable option. Users ignore it. They add flashing notifications begging users to use it. They’re ignored too. They give Feature X a prominent, always on button right on the main screen. They add more keyboard and mouse shortcuts so there are more ways to invoke Feature X. They add dedicate hardware keys&#x2F;buttons to invoke Feature X. They add full-screen reminders to remind users Feature X is so cool! They even make it so it’s easy to invoke Feature X by accident. While these things may slightly juice Feature X’s usage metrics, it just never takes off because users fundamentally don’t want it and nobody wants to admit failure.<p>Look at the software your company makes and I bet you can quickly find an example of this.

"As much as I am an old-school Unix zealot, I think it is time to move towards a well standardised binary config format with non-trivial types (i.e a schema).  There still has to be a standard text format, but only for the source from which the live configs have to be built.  Done right, this has several advantages:<p>1. Built-time validation (or at least type checking).<p>2. Built configs can be easy to parse but (potentially) rich enough to avoid confusing templating.<p>3. Separation of concerns between storing&#x2F;maintaining configs and applying them.  E.g. scoop text configs off a source repo, but send out binary configs over the network.<p>All this is a fantasy in my head.  Right now the closest mainstream thing is protobufs.

"Interesting take on the situation - one key difference is I don’t feel any less safe now than 10 years ago walking around. I DO see more “open” use, and people walking around obviously on something, especially by the homeless (which makes sense even if they’re not using at a higher level). I don’t see the social services much though. IMO they could use more visibility. The prevailing opinion seems like we do “nothing”.<p>I’d like to see the stats on mortality and quality of life to those that get treatment though.

Thanks MS.  Would also like to see ext4 support in Windows and better NTFS support under Linux.  Then the turnaround (on the technical side at least) will be complete.
In my opinion Firefox could take it one step further and build-in Ublock Origin into the browser. Give it extreme speed with native Rust code. Of course configurable but with a few malware lists enabled by default and a few trackers blocked.<p>That&#x27;d make me definitely switch if I&#x27;d get faster ad-blocking and only lose HW accelerated video.
"I&#x27;ll believe Microsoft loves Linux when I can install Microsoft Office in my desktop Linux machine. Everything else is marketing.<p>Edit: to expand, the corporate world runs on Excel&#x2F;PowerPoint&#x2F;Outlook. Microsoft milks them on Windows&#x2F;Office licensing and is very aggressive against organizations that try to do Linux deployments. They&#x27;re a convicted monopolist that got away easily when at some point the option on the table was to split OS and Office into two different companies. If they want to continue to use Office to keep Windows dominant that&#x27;s their strategy. WSL and their other &quot;love Linux&quot; efforts are all about making sure developers stay on Windows.

"I still remember one of the first professional talk I had to give. I was an intern in a company and I had to present my work to about 20 people, nothing very impressive.. Yet it was a terrible experience. My mouth was so dry that I could barely speak. I didn&#x27;t think of bringing water, and too shy to ask.<p>I realised that I was much more stressed when I had to present my own work&#x2F;research than let say, a class, or somebody else&#x27;s work. It wasn&#x27;t simply talking in public that affected me, but also the fear of being judged and criticised.<p>Eventually, I got more experience (I was professor for a while) and it became like second nature. It is really just a matter of practice.<p>That being said,  I&#x27;m certainly not a great orator. For instance, I&#x27;ve always disliked giving longer lectures where you need somehow to keep the audience awake. In that context, because I can&#x27;t rely on my eloquence, I try to engage the audience with some  questions, exercises, and alternate the unavoidable boring parts with more interesting parts.<p>Another thing that I noticed when watching speakers on youtube, is that they often do the exact same speech hundreds of time! When you watch several videos of them, you realize that they tend to repeat the exact same sentences from one speech to the next, even when they answer questions. No wonder they are good speakers."

Don’t let yourself fall into a rut of using just one language, thinking that it defines what programming means.<p>&gt; Try to rise above the syntax and semantics of a single language to think about algorithms and data structures in the abstract.

"Mis-types, reliability, etc. aside, I just don&#x27;t like the keyboard.  Normal chiclets are bad enough, but the mac is worse.  Essentially zero travel, and I find my self bottoming out each stroke and typing what is evidently much too hard.  I got used to chiclets okay (though I still use a full mechanical when I can), but the mac keyboard is too much.  I feel like I&#x27;m typing on a touch-screen, or worse, that I&#x27;m some how playing with a toy (rather than a machine built to do work).<p>I guess a lot of Apple&#x27;s products give me that feeling these days.  Ios 7 design probably didn&#x27;t help much.  Maybe with Jony Ive gone, it will get better?  I like things that feel solid.  These days, macs just don&#x27;t.  I probably shouldn&#x27;t beat on just apple here, though; it seems to be a broader trend for the worse."

"What I liked about the current KSP is that everything is real. NASA actually sent a satellite to all of our Soler system&#x27;s planets. They actually developed a rover that can drive on the moon, and they preformed rendezvous with two spaceships. They also had to deal with a finite amount of fuel and parts that could be destroyed if there was too much pressure or heat on them.<p>Now with colonies and mining it is less realistic and more sci-fi. I can see the appeal of that, but it is a different appeal. I would have preferred that they spent energy developing things to make it more realistic. For example, Lagrange points, different forms of propellents, n body physics, automation, ets. Recently with Bereshit I learned that before (certain?) rockets can fire their main engines they have to fire small ones to provide acceleration in order to move the fuel in the big tank closer to the main engine. It would have been nice if KSP also took that into account.<p>On an unrelated topic, I wonder how KSP 2 will make multiplayer work with timewarp"

I prefer working in person at times, it really depends on what I&#x27;m doing, but the option is what makes it work for me. 100% remote would only make me happy for so long, I think.<p>Also, rarely discussed in these types of posts is that your social abilities definitely diminish if you work from home a lot and rarely interact with people.

On top of that, you’ll get illegal parking which causes property damage and poses risks to public safety."
"So I&#x27;ve been reading about this dude, and apparently he started _several_ technology companies _while working at Google_, and sold a couple of them back to Google. Clearly his Google employment contract terms weren&#x27;t the same as mine. In fact &quot;normal&quot; employees would be fired the same day for some of the things he did even before he copied off a bunch of Google IP.<p>I kind of wonder what&#x27;s so special about the guy that Google wanted him so bad that they let him basically write his own employment contract, allowed him to have huge conflicts of interest, and then also paid like tens of millions in bonuses per year.<p>I also wonder what else he wrote into that employment contract of his.

"Purchase data has been around for years. Marketers want to know if their ad dollars worked. “How did you hear about us?” provides scant and mostly unusable data.

"I have been really enjoying the way games are being stylized nowadays. We reached a level of fidelity that is really expensive to maintain I think, and so game studios are leaning in on really solid art direction instead. It makes for much more interesting worlds and longer lasting art.<p>For example, LA Noire looks dated (though still excellent in many ways), while Borderlands looks as good as when it was released.<p>LA Noire while it feels a bit dated, the characters don&#x27;t really hit uncanny valley thanks to the facial motion capture technology. I am still aware they are a video game character, just a very emotive one.<p>It makes me think there is a peak realism we should chase, after which improved graphics wouldn&#x27;t really add much. I wonder if maybe we aren&#x27;t already there.<p>Many games suffer from high detail but lack of clarity. We are still working with a 2D screen with limited dynamic range after all. So that means when there is higher detail it can get overly busy. Lacking contrast, making it hard to decipher what you are looking at quickly, especially if it is moving. Stylized games can add visual contrast in their lighting and art, improving clarity overall. Having said that, I think games could leanr some tricks from cinema in this regard. Just capturing what is real doesn&#x27;t make good cinema, you have to engineer the scene and the shot."

"&gt; The microbes’ apparent ability to ingest electrons — known as direct electron transfer — is particularly intriguing because it seems to defy the basic rules of biophysics. The fatty membranes that enclose cells act as an insulator, creating an electrically neutral zone once thought impossible for an electron to cross. “No one wanted to believe that a bacterium would take an electron from inside of the cell and move it to the outside,” said Kenneth Nealson, a geobiologist at the University of Southern California, in a lecture to the Society for Applied Microbiology in London last year.<p>One could say the same about Na+, K+, and Ca++.

They all have limited resources to throw at this problem so everything is sub-par. It&#x27;s like going to McDonalds for good coffee -- no, you go to a coffee shop if you want good coffee.

I use GNU Emacs, GCC, various other compilers, various servers, and many other things, but these code artisans put advertisements in their drivel because they don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re making enough money from it, and this is an attitude many of these JavaScript people share.  I intend to try to make money off my future projects by either selling documentation or being paid for writing the project to start with.<p>I could go on a much longer rant, but why bother?"
It feels like GCP figured out a way to charge for ingress. I can get behind using NAT instead of our instances having external IP&#x27;s but a 4.5¢&#x2F;GB hit on egress AND ingress traffic is hard to swallow.
"I&#x27;ve used WiringPI, it&#x27;s a solid library, and - like a lot of people - I&#x27;m glad it exists.<p>But here&#x27;s a contrarian view - I&#x27;m not sure why someone offering a project for free <i>in the educational space</i> would expect users to act like paid professional customers. Or expect them to be non-noob experts who can modify and build the project without hand-holding.<p>Or assume that email would be a viable line of support for a project with literally tens (hundreds?) of thousands of users.<p>Or even expect them to be adults.<p>So while I sympathise with the rage quit, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s realistic to release code and just expect users to understand - never mind accept - the terms you set for its use.<p>All open source projects comes with politics included. You have to have an understanding of the space you&#x27;re working in, the kinds of users who inhabit it, and the kinds of relationships they&#x27;re likely to have with them.<p>You need to know what your support boundaries and support technologies are. And if you work in a space where some of your users are likely to be assholes, you need to have a plan for that - even if it&#x27;s just knowing that it&#x27;s fine to ignore them.<p>Edit: to be clear, I think this is more of a general open licence problem than the failing of this one specific author. Open licences don&#x27;t encourage authors to define boundaries, or even to understand that boundaries are necessary and terms need to be defined. So it&#x27;s not quite a surprise that things like this happen."

"Policing at scale is difficult, as YouTube and Facebook have learned.<p>Small communities are far easier to police. But to do it pre-emptively with AI is an open problem. My interest is how can we make a system that will reliably converge in most cases to what’s true, like Wikipedia?

One I thought of is that you gain reputation points linearly but lose them exponentially in high-stakes challenges. The question is who can resolve a challenge one way or the other. And whether the result is immutable or can swing back if it turns out eg that the challenge was swayed by a coordinated effort.<p>If it’s a static system there are always going to be increasingly sophisticated attacks built on coordination (sybil attacks, sleepers). The most basic attacks require a net gain in credits to be sustainable. Namely, coordinated attacks (marauders) have to win challenges (and net positive points). But later on, attacks can be paid for by trading outside currency (eg BTC or USD) in exchange for using internal credits (“aged accounts”) in “vandalism” actions (attacks which do not gain credits but may even lose them, but are sustained by outside gain).<p>This is an issue for the source of truth for cryptocurrency as well, but at least the data is very well defined, and there doesn’t seem to be a huge gain from vandalism (except shorting). National elections in the US also have similar things for ballot counting. On Amazon and the sites I’m talking about, we are referencing outside events instead of internal processes. Wikipedia seems to have the most successful model w human editors of various kinds watching over the result.<p>Is there published research on the game-theoretic aspects of maintaining integrity of collaboratively edited information about the external world?"
"It&#x27;s interesting to think about the different motivations people have for contributing to open source.

"It feels an awful lot like the people putting out this statement want to position themselves as the actual driving force behind the focus on shareholder value in the 80s, and thus use that branding to also posit an authority to change future corporate governance in a way that accommodates the current political climate. It&#x27;s absurd to think that they would have that kind of power, but that aspect of it is probably harmless in the long run; I think the bigger concern is how this statement can be used and incorporated as a bigger vision for governance that appears to address fundamental problems with the way our economy is run without actually addressing them, much the way a focus on plastic straws lets people feel like they&#x27;re addressing ocean plastic without actually addressing it."

"Well, I&#x27;ll be the dark cloud here.  As someone who used APL professionally for a decade, having studied and interacted with many of the early APL pioneers, including Ken Iverson, everything related to J, including this article&#x27;s proposal, is an absolute abomination to me.<p>What many people lack is a sense of history.  Why does something like J even exist?  Do you know?  I do.  It was a horrible mistake on the part of Iverson in response to the limitations of the hardware issues we had to deal with at the time (think 80&#x27;s).<p>How does a man who authored a paper exalting the advantages and power of notation as a tool for thought [0], turn around and create something like J?<p>Simple answer:  Business, for the most part, and, if I am going to be benevolent, a naive attempt to bring something to the masses (while destroying APL).<p>Here&#x27;s what you had to do at the time if you wanted to run APL on IBM PC&#x27;s (or clones):<p><pre><code>    - Buy a specific motherboard (if it was not an original IBM PC)
    - Buy a specific graphics card (which really wasn&#x27;t a graphics card at all, just text)
    - Purchase or program a character EPROM that replaced rarely used characters with APL characters
    - Swap out the stock character ROM with the custom EPROM
    - In some cases install a toggle switch outside the computer to be able to switch between APL and standard ROM&#x27;s
    - Purchase either an IBM Selectric or pinwheel printer
    - Purchase an expensive character ball for your IBM printer or an equally expensive APL character for your printer
    - And then you had to buy your APL interpreter from a company like STSC for hundreds of 1980&#x27;s dollars
</code></pre>
This meant a number of things:<p><pre><code>    - APL was outside the purview of &quot;civilians&quot;
    - Normal office environments were never going to consider something like this
    - There was a cost and technical complexity to wanting to use APL
    - Installing a modified APL character EPROM broke applications that relied on the characters 
      in the character table that were replaced (mostly characters you could use for basic drawing on a terminal)
    - APL was very much limited to those who absolutely-positively had to have it
    - That meant academia and very niche applications (financials)
    - Widespread adoption was pretty much impossible
</code></pre>
It is in that context that Iverson thought-up the idea of transliterating APL symbols into combinations of ASCII characters.  It was a failed attempt to make things more accessible to the masses by compromising the very foundation of APL.  This was very short-sighted.  Computers evolved very quickly and very soon both displaying and printing APL characters was within the reach of any 15 year old with a computer.<p>And it was a failure.  Not the least of the reasons for this being that, to the average person, J code looks like ASCII vomit.  APL has distinct symbols, just like mathematics.  One might not be able to understand the code but the end product not only looks very different from ASCII vomit, it is.  Because notation has power.<p>The correct path would have been to understand technology would catch-up to the requirements of APL and focus on extending and improving the language.  A simple example of this would be adding an object-oriented programming layer to the language.  Compilation and distribution through executable files and (civilian) installation packages, which are valuable for commercial closed-source security and deployment, would also have been a valuable add-ons.  I was working with Assembler, FORTH, C, and C++ at the same time I worked with APL.  I could deliver executable user-installable programs in any of those languages --and sell them!-- while my use of APL was limited to a range between academic and internal tools.  It would have been brilliant to have been able to deliver finished user applications indistinguishable (by the user) from those written in C or C++.  That was impossible.  They should have worked on that, and more.<p>Frankly, I have been wishing, for decades now, for someone to stand on the shoulders of APL and develop it&#x27;s successor.  A rich SYMBOLIC language capable of allowing rich and effortless expression of ideas at an entirely different level of thought and abstraction than for-loops and indenting lines by four spaces.<p>Anyhow, it&#x27;s a soapbox.  I know.  Getting off it.  I need to go do some useful work.<p>[0] <a href=""http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.eecg.toronto.edu&#x2F;~jzhu&#x2F;csc326&#x2F;readings&#x2F;iverson.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.eecg.toronto.edu&#x2F;~jzhu&#x2F;csc326&#x2F;readings&#x2F;iverson.pd...</a>"

"There&#x27;s just no way any elections in Russia would produce the results not approved by the government.

They also know they will have significant issues, career, legal, and otherwise, if it doesn&#x27;t happen.<p>Funniest thing is, they don&#x27;t even need to do this. Because nearly all of the mass media is under government control, the incumbents have overwhelming support of the people as it is."

"I&#x27;m a YNAB user and I just spent some time playing around with LunchMoney.  A few quick feedback items from 10 minutes of use:<p>--Let me add new categories from the transaction screen.  I don&#x27;t think your default categories are comprehensive enough and I had to add a lot, and it is a pain going back and forth between the two screens.<p>--More default categories that make sense:  rent, cell phone, internet, medical, software subscriptions.<p>--If I go back 3 months and categorize an old transaction, apply that category to all other matching transactions.  I don&#x27;t want to through every single old transaction and categorize.  Alternatively you could use the YNAB method and not even pull in old transactions (or maybe just go back 1 week or something).  It feels overwhelming to log in and see data that is wrong due to miscategorizations and then realize I need to back through hundreds of old transactions and fix the category.<p>Overall I think you have a great product!  I am definitely interested in continuing to use it, I like the UI and it feels so much faster and more responsive than YNAB (their ui is extremely slow).

I guess not all workplaces support it in the same way as mine does, but it was possible for me to have a three month trial phase after which I can go back to 100% or decide to continue the 80% for a year. Maybe your workplace would be open for that but you just don&#x27;t know!<p>Of course it&#x27;s quite the pay cut, but as a developer with few obligations I can still manage quite well. I feel much more relaxed over all and I enjoy my work more when I&#x27;m there. It even subjectively feels like I&#x27;m getting more done at work. The weekend feels so much longer and relaxing, because stuff I normally do on the weekend often is already done.<p>One problem for me is that I tend to cram a lot into my Fridays.

I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s anything constructive to be said here because this is so obviously a bad move (for users).<p>I feel like Google is quickly moving in the footsteps of IE; embrace, extend, extinguish and all that. I don&#x27;t like how Google now has so much market share in the browser space that they can essentially unilaterally make decisions that are user-unfriendly and have a real impact. I switched (back) to Firefox for this reason. I switched away from them when they essentially purged Brendan Eich for political reasons, but they&#x27;re the lesser of two evils now.<p>I guess in summary, all browsers suck and we&#x27;re all fucked."
I live in TN which fortunately doesn’t have Lyme carrying ticks but other bad things like Rocky Mountain spotted fever and alpha gal (allergy to meat thanks to the lone star tick).<p>There are several precautions we take every time we go camping or hiking during tick season:<p>1. Spray permethrin on shoes and ankles.<p>2. Tuck pants into socks.<p>3. Leg tick checks during + full body check when we get home and for next two days.<p>4. Toss all clothes in the drier. The heat kills them. Do not wash first!<p>5. Shower with T&#x2F;gel. Still not fully tested but we heard this will kill them!<p>So far I’ve had a few cases of an attached tick but nothing longer than half a day of exposure. Bleh!!

"I gave up on Julia at 0.6 for these reasons a couple of years ago, before giving it another try at 1.1<p>Unfortunately, while the startup time has improved, I still find the JIT compiler overhead makes it unsuitable for most shorter scripts - the sort of thing where I would normally use python or R. Taking a few minutes to produce the first plot of the day while julia recompiles the plotting packages dependency tree is just a pain.<p>Edit: 
After a fresh install of 1.1, I found loading the Plotly package takes 4 seconds from a fresh repl, while the first plot with the Plotly.jl backend (plot(rand(5,5),linewidth=2,title=&quot;My Plot&quot;)) takes 14s, and subsequent plots take less than 1s on my computer. This is a marked improvement on 0.6, which is where my few minutes came from. Couldn&#x27;t get PyPlot to work."

"As someone who has followed the constructed language and international auxiliary language community for a couple of decades, and as someone with an undergraduate degree in linguistics, I do not see a constructed language catching on with the mainstream public any time soon.<p>A constructed language is a language that someone sits down and creates; this is different from a natural language which just forms as people communicate with each other.  There are many constructed languages: Klingon in Star Trek is an actual constructed language, as is the language the Elves spoke in The Lord of the Rings.<p>Esperanto, and Interslavic, are examples of <i>International Auxiliary Languages</i> (IAL), languages specially made to be easy to learn to facilitate international communication.  We have had those languages for well over a century, and none of them have caught on.<p>The reason why an IAL has not caught on is because people are motivated to learn a language when it has prestige, not because it’s easier to learn.  Right now, for better or for worse, English is that language (with all of its warts: Auxiliary words to carry tense, the rather strange tense&#x2F;lax vowel distinction, etc.) right now.<p>I would love to see an IAL to catch on, but there’s a serious marketing issue, especially since a lot of people just don’t have the mind to learn a new language as an adult, no matter how easy the language is to learn."
"I&#x27;ve been thinking about this too much recently. Only a month ago did I realize that all the reading on HN I&#x27;ve done over the years hasn&#x27;t given me much to think about or remember beyond the span of a day. None of it has made me any smarter, because I wasn&#x27;t approaching it with that goal. All I really desired when I instinctively typed the &quot;n&quot; in the omnibar and pressed Enter was wanting to be amused and nothing more.<p>Yet I wouldn&#x27;t be honest if I said I didn&#x27;t enjoy the time I spent, at least in the moment. It&#x27;s just that &quot;enjoyment&quot; shuts down personal growth for me. I&#x27;ve since realized I was using the &quot;time enjoyed is not wasted&quot; adage as an excuse to not think critically and make honest attempts at internalizing new knowledge. As someone else mentioned the better word to use instead of &quot;enjoyed&quot; would be &quot;fulfilled&quot; because it takes into account the long term.<p>I&#x27;ve found that I&#x27;ve become too good at subverting ways of not stressing out about figuring out one&#x27;s lifestyle and using them to get complacent, when if I chose to think just the slightest bit more carefully I would realize I wasn&#x27;t actually working towards what I wanted. For that matter I didn&#x27;t even <i>know</i> what I wanted for a long time, because I never bothered to ask.<p>If you search hard enough there will always be someone who will tell you you&#x27;re doing just fine.<p>In addition to a lack of creativity I can&#x27;t remember much of what I&#x27;ve consumed. I don&#x27;t use Facebook or Twitter so my usual assumption was that by consuming things that take continuous effort and resources to make, like television shows, I was spending my time more wisely. That wasn&#x27;t really true if I made no effort to remember or understand what I had seen. To me it might as well be that I had never seen any of it in the first place and the time was lost.<p>I&#x27;ve decided that some things are worth remembering and the only way I can remember anything for sure is by writing it down, so any time I consume I try to reflect on it and write a few paragraphs about the general plot, themes or personal takeaways. Even when I forget it later I can look back on my notes and know I made an effort to understand something. I know now that if I don&#x27;t bother to do this I won&#x27;t have anything interesting to talk about if it comes up in conversation except &quot;I liked it,&quot; which has become one of the most painful responses for me to give.<p>And this is just about consumption, not creative output. Suddenly I want to try to understand more things I consume but I also want to make room for trying to explore my own ideas. It&#x27;s overwhelming and with a traditional day job it becomes soul-crushingly stressful."

Many important NLP tasks have almost nobody publicly working on them it seems, on paperswithcode.com or NLP-progress (from github) some tasks have only one or two papers...
And many others have not evolved since 2016. 
Most of the time it seems trivial to beat the old state of the art, just use BERT or XLnet on a task where nobody applied it before and hop, free state of the art for you! Yet researchers don&#x27;t seems to chase those low hanging, high returns fruits.
Also researchers seems to work a lot in isolation, many new generic improvements like new optimizers (RAdam for example) and new activation functions (Swish) allow to beat most of older state of the art on almost all task just by using them. 
Yet researchers will take years before using them because of an absurd inertia.
Also unlike an open source program, BERT and XLnet have very low response and activity on github despite major open issues...

Plenty of comments are mentioning slow performance. Not having used Perl 6 myself, I can&#x27;t comment on it, but the fact that this seems to crop up a lot is really worrying.

I was just telling me wife a few weeks back about Microsoft Encarta. Turns out she had a copy too back in the day.<p>My best memory is getting a copy shortly after CD-ROM drives were still new territory. I loaded the disc and the first thing I searched for was either rap or hip&#x2F;hop. To my delight an audio clip played of Grandmaster Flash &amp; The Furious Five - The Message...keep in mind this was at a time when Multimedia was new and the idea that CD-ROMs could hold enough data to make a richer experience was ground-breaking!

"There is a lot of concern in this thread about open source projects needing funding and they&#x27;re not wrong.  There are a lot of projects that are underfunded--most of them, in fact.<p>However, it&#x27;s not like the developers of and contributors to these projects naively go in thinking they&#x27;re going to get paid anything.  They graciously choose to make the fruits of their efforts freely available regardless of compensation.  And, yes, there are companies making money off of that generosity.<p>My point is; nobody is in the wrong here.  Both parties have entered into this agreement willingly.<p>Injecting ads like this is wrong because the developers are reneging on that agreement.  It&#x27;s as if the developers are saying, &quot;You know what? I changed my mind and I want some money for this because companies are making money off of it now.&quot;  What&#x27;s worse is they aren&#x27;t even charging the companies directly.<p>I&#x27;m all for a discussion around how to help generate funding for FOSS projects but have we not learned from Google, Facebook, and others how wrong a path advertising can be?  At what point are the advertisers going to want demographic information and the module developers start requiring you provide that information at &#x27;npm install&#x27;?"
One of the frustrating things about ecig studies is that they always use the worst quality hardware and puff really hard on them. The &quot;Epuffer&quot; looks like one of those &quot;cig-a-like&quot; which are notoriously worse than the much more expensive hobbyist mech mods. The cig-a-likes usually don&#x27;t get enough juice to the heating element so when you&#x27;re puffing a lot (16 consecutive 3s pulls) you end up burning the wick.
This is what the FIRE movement (Financial Independence and Retire Early) is all about. I would highly recommend the book &quot;Your money or your life&quot; by Vicki Robin. The best approach to switching to more meaningful work is to start by getting your financial life in order. I speak with personal experience: I realized earlier this year that I did not need to feel stuck in a dead-end job and this gave me the courage to quit.
"&gt; In addition to winning this illustrious competition, Bouattour and M’Seddi have a few other things in common. Both forewent the traditional trade school that many aspiring French bakers enter at age 16. Both have been professional bakers for less than a decade (as has this year’s winner, former engineer Fabrice Leroy). And both are first-generation Frenchmen with what Bouattour euphemistically dubs ‘origins’: family backgrounds from elsewhere – or in their cases, Tunisia.<p>&gt; “I stopped thinking of myself as a foreigner a long time ago, but my origins make me the person I am today,” he said. “We all start with the same tools, the same teachers, but some people are going to understand things differently. That has nothing to do with origins; that’s just talent.”<p>For all the rhetoric on the right about how people from other cultures are not &quot;suitable&quot; for &quot;western&quot; countries - some of the proudest citizens and torch-carriers for tradition, are foreigners.<p>It also absolutely works both ways - Australia was virulently anti Italian and Greek in the 50s and 60s.

"Hi HN, I’m Soham Sankaran, the founder of Pashi, the company behind Saag as a Service (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;saag.pashi.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;saag.pashi.com</a>). We offer three macronutrient-portioned variants of Saag (delicately-spiced Indian spinach curry): High Fat Saag Paneer, Balanced Saag Tofu, and High Protein Saag Seitan. We currently deliver weekly to customers in the SF Bay Area.<p>I started this service because I’ve struggled with nutrition all my life -- with obesity, the threat of my long family history of diabetes, and with getting adequate protein as a vegetarian in the United States. I’ve never had the time to consistently cook all my meals, and it’s hard to know the nutritional value of food you’re getting at restaurants unless you stick to salads or chain fast food (which is required to have nutritional information but is routinely off by 20-40%). Even if you know the nutritional values of the food you’re eating, attempting to log all your meals and snacks in a journal or an app like MyFitnessPal can be a massive time-sink and mental load.<p>‘Complete nutrition’ products like Soylent and Huel were appealing for relieving the physical and cognitive burden of dealing with nutrition all the time, but I perceived two major issues with them:<p>1) They taste absolutely terrible. These products are a massive step backward from thousands of years of accumulated culinary experience, and I don’t believe that most people are willing to forgo the pleasure that comes from eating real food three times a day, even if some kind of meal replacement is the right choice for their health. The biggest issue with diet plans and nutrition studies of all kinds is pervasively low adherence -- it just isn’t possible to get most people to consistently eat food that doesn’t taste good.<p>2) The retail versions of these products are not particularly customizable. Different people have different nutritional needs -- certainly calorically, but also in terms of macronutrient proportions. A female weightlifter and a male endurance runner have different bodies and different goals, resulting in different optimal nutritional profiles. Feeding them the same one-size-fits-all meal replacement is a mistake.<p>I stated Pashi to provide a real-food based nutrition service that tastes great but still retains the desirable characteristics of things like Soylent. The long term vision is to usher in a world where people can eat real, tasty food that is seamlessly customized to the specific nutritional profile they desire.<p>I initially soft-launched Pashi as a producer of entire meals with fully customizable calorie counts and macronutrient proportions, but this seemed to confuse people and didn&#x27;t get very much traction. As a result, we’ve scaled back the focus to one of the most popular, customizable, and easily explainable foods on our menu -- Saag. If this gets some traction, we’ll introduce more fine-grained nutritional customization and more menu items depending on the feedback we get from our users.<p>I’d love to get the community’s thoughts on this and answer any questions here or via email (soham@pashi.com)."

"Over years and years of arguing online, I started to notice that few people change their minds.  For most, argument is a sort of self-confirming rehearsal.  You&#x27;re being challenged to see if your articulation holds up to their assault, not to see if their position agrees with yours.<p>It became frustrating to witness this because, in part, the same arguments kept getting repeated.  The same debunked points, the same rhetorical tactics, the same back-and-forth got boring to read and I started to feel like we were unable to solve or advance anything.<p>So I started not participating, but kept reading.  I&#x27;d still see interesting information or links or citations.  Lurking was still fun.  And a funny thing happened: once I stopped participating, I became much more empathetic.  I didn&#x27;t agree with others more, but I felt much more to understand their points and their perspectives as &quot;I could agree with this under these circumstances&quot;.<p>Nowadays I participate only to clearly rebut false information, to expand on something I agree with, or to inject good data.

This could be tested by &quot;clean-room&quot; reimplementing something that is historically known to have many security issues.<p>3) Are there showstoppers for kernel builds? Interoperability, build performance, architectures unsupported by Rust, etc. If so, could these be mitigated? Conversely, is there something positive Rust could provide?<p>4) How does it affect runtime performance? Average case. Bloat issues? Any pathologic cases? Any benefits?<p>5) What other unexpected it brings on the plate? Both benefits and disadvantages. For example, could Rust types also be used to catch errors other than memory related, like invalid states?<p>6) &lt;Your consideration here or above&gt;"
"Cool visualization! One thing that isn&#x27;t mentioned is the difference between true and magnetic compass directions. The runway illustration shows a runway 05 with a heading of 50°. The illustration makes it look like these are true degrees, since 0° is at the top as it would be in a typical map aligned with true north.<p>But runways are not named by their true heading, they are named by their magnetic heading. It&#x27;s generally not a huge difference, for example true and magnetic north are about 12° apart at JFK in New York.

"<i>Routinely I see in numerous online discussions that people refuse to even consider Perl 6 because they hate Perl. Or there are younger people who think of Perl as &quot;their grandfather&#x27;s language&quot; (in much the same way people in my generation view COBOL).</i><p>I am not a fan of Perl, but this feels tragic to me.  Perl was so radically different.  I remember being on Perlmonks way back in the day, and someone would post a question about why their code didn&#x27;t work, and there would be dozens of people who could instantly, intuitively post a corrected version of the code, but then the poster would say &quot;oh, shit, what was <i>my</i> code doing? and why does the correct code do something different?&quot; and you&#x27;d be lucky if there was a single person (<i>cough</i> chromatic) who could explain it.  And none of the Perl fans cared, because Perl made them extremely powerful and productive, and they could (almost always) confidently produce a line of Perl code that did what they wanted.  The analogy to natural language carried further into practice than Larry Wall could have dreamed.  Nobody worries that the difficulty of resolving linguistic conundrums impairs their ability to have a conversation, and the Perl ninjas in my company enjoyed a very close and chatty relationship with the systems they worked on.<p>I&#x27;m the opposite kind of person, who got sick to his stomach looking at a line of code like !#$foo-&gt;%_[] (note: not real Perl) not knowing why it worked, even if I wrote it and knew that it would work.  Even now, I have a nagging fear that if I executed &quot;!#$foo-&gt;%_[] (note: not real Perl)&quot; it would print &quot;Yes it is!  Ha ha.  Love, Larry&quot; to the console.  I can&#x27;t stand that, so Perl was never for me, but I still hope that against all odds this long, drawn-out apparent deathbed scene turns out to be the middle of a successful convalescence."

Perhaps curiosity. Perhaps sheer stubborness. Possibly self-loathing. Maybe it&#x27;s the scientific mind, wanting to learn about human capability. Maybe it&#x27;s introspection: I just want to know what I&#x27;m capable of, whether I&#x27;m up to the challenge or not. But lets be honest: I&#x27;m a lazy bum, and now I&#x27;m just doing this because I&#x27;m too invested, not because I can actually be bothered. Hmm... I wonder if the 5 minutes is up yet, it certainly feels like it&#x27;s approaching. Maybe another minute? I want to look at the clock, but I can&#x27;t do that and type at the same time.

I jumped with joy when I finished my last English exam, and I vindictively told my English teacher this fact: I will never need to use these skills ever again! Never! I&#x27;m going into Science. Cold, hard science, the world of numbers and equations and facts. No wishy-washy feelings or emotions, opinions and perspectives. Just graphs and numbers. How wrong I was!

"It&#x27;s probably too hard to answer the general question about &quot;how to gain math intuition&quot;. Mathematics is just too vast.<p>However, you have written<p>&gt; I think when I took physics it really brought out these flaws and lack of intuition<p>which suggests you have some good practical experience with physics problem solving which has precipitated a certain feeling that you need to learn more about some kind of math. I would advise that you try to exploit this. In the same breath I want to recognize (as someone who did their BS and MS in physics) that physicists are not always so careful or explicit in how they are doing their mathematics. So learning means eventually going beyond physics sources and into a much wider world of mathematical thought. The particular things that mathematicians care about may or may not be relevant to the problem you are trying to solve in physics, and a good part of developing that intuition is to figure out which particular caveats that a mathematician expounds upon (more often than not, some esoterica about the space(s) that they are working in or the class of isomorphisms under which their results are invariant) matter physically. As you develop and intuition about these things a bonus is that you will be able to skim through mathematics resources much faster."

"Researchers overlook more important issue. As the government controls the servers, it can impersonate any number of users.<p>Users submit an application to vote remotely through a government-controlled site and confirm it by receiving a SMS with code. It is obvious that government is able to submit such an application to its own server without bothering the real user.<p>The users vote remotely and confirm their identity by providing a code from SMS (again) and the government can just look at the code on the server. It isn&#x27;t important what cryptography is used there. You don&#x27;t need to guess random numbers when you have root access to the server.<p>The observers are supposed to see a tape where some hashes will be printed when someone votes. Maybe they will be allowed to see the registry of voters who chose to vote remotely, maybe they will not be allowed.<p>I cannot prove this, and this is my personal opinion, so you shouldn&#x27;t believe me, but I think the government wants an opaque procedure to produce legitimate looking election results with desired outcome. With paper voting, there are too many points of failure: it is difficult to throw the ballots in the box when there is a vigilant observer. Remote voting doesn&#x27;t have such flaws.<p>If there was a fraud, it would be difficult to explain to a non-programmer. They don&#x27;t understand anything, they just see how the program says &quot;hash doesn&#x27;t match&quot;. But maybe it is just a program written by foreign agents (and stored on foreign &quot;Github&quot; servers) producing fake results. For comparison, with paper voting anyone can understand that there is a fraud if you show them the video.<p>Also, the government party is slowly losing its rating and starts losing regional elections. Remote voting might be a cure for this undesired situation.<p>And probably any other government (for example Estonian) that implements such an opaque system has similar aims."
"This isn&#x27;t an answer, but an observation. I taught an EE course many years ago -- the second semester of electrodynamics.

I noticed that some math topics are very important to engineering and physics coursework, but given short shrift in the math department.

"Interestingly the article on the bottom links to a Usenix 2019 (held Aug 14 - 16) paper with the title &quot;A Billion Open Interfaces for Eve and Mallory: MitM, DoS, and Tracking Attacks on iOS and macOS Through Apple Wireless Direct Link&quot;<p>Abstract:<p>&quot;Apple Wireless Direct Link (AWDL) is a key protocol in Apple&#x27;s ecosystem used by over one billion iOS and macOS devices for device-to-device communications. AWDL is a proprietary extension of the IEEE 802.11 (Wi-Fi) standard and integrates with Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) for providing services such as Apple AirDrop. We conduct the first security and privacy analysis of AWDL and its integration with BLE. We uncover several security and privacy vulnerabilities ranging from design flaws to implementation bugs leading to a man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack enabling stealthy modification of files transmitted via AirDrop, denial-of-service (DoS) attacks preventing communication, privacy leaks that enable user identification and long-term tracking undermining MAC address randomization, and DoS attacks enabling targeted or simultaneous crashing of all neighboring devices. The flaws span across AirDrop&#x27;s BLE discovery mechanism, AWDL synchronization, UI design, and Wi-Fi driver implementation. Our analysis is based on a combination of reverse engineering of protocols and code supported by analyzing patents. We provide proof-of-concept implementations and demonstrate that the attacks can be mounted using a low-cost ($20) micro:bit device and an off-the-shelf Wi-Fi card. We propose practical and effective countermeasures. While Apple was able to issue a fix for a DoS attack vulnerability after our responsible disclosure, the other security and privacy vulnerabilities require the redesign of some of their services.&quot; [1]<p>I got nothing to add regarding OpenDrop other than that I love interoperability, and that I love it when FOSS enables this.<p>[1] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.usenix.org&#x2F;conference&#x2F;usenixsecurity19&#x2F;presentation&#x2F;stute"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.usenix.org&#x2F;conference&#x2F;usenixsecurity19&#x2F;presentat...</a>"

"I just see too many programmers that right from the start try to micro-optimize their code with things like this. You&#x27;ll usually see very well written code but with all sorts of hacks, taken from blogs and StackOverflow answers and whatnot all across the web, but in the end they fail to optimize their actual algorithm and end up with some ultra-high memory footprints or O(n^3) stuff instead of some nice O(log(n)) for example.

"I found John Stuart Mill&#x27;s life to be interesting. John&#x27;s father was a radical and a prominent Benthamite. He raised his son to be the lion of their cause, and home schooled John to avoid the the state education system. John&#x27;s father felt that the state schools instilled too much conformity and discouraged independent thinking.<p>For a time, John Stuart Mill was indeed a lion for his father&#x27;s ideals. However, it should perhaps not be too terribly surprising that Stuart&#x27;s independent thinking lead him to somewhat diverge from his father&#x27;s perspectives.<p>One of the more important moments for that was in his twenties. John came to realize that even if all the reforms he wished for came to pass, he would still be unhappy. That realization lead to a nervous breakdown. He slowly recovered, reworking his father&#x27;s philosophy into something that would allow him to live a life worth living."

"The problem is not the parking spaces. It is also not the roads. Take them away and you only make life more miserable for car commuters. You need two things:<p>1. Attractive alternatives (really good, clean, fast public transport or really good, safe, fast bike lanes)<p>2. An incentive to not use the car for commuting.<p>The problem with 1. is that politicians find it much harder to create something good than to make it&#x27;s opposite worse. The problem with 2. is that a car is a relatively expensive investment, so people will use it. You could, for instance, introduce a flexible city toll that allows you 50 days of free entering by car and serves as a PT ticket as well."

"I found the interview hard to follow, so I&#x27;ll just focus on a few bits.<p>I disagree with the idea that mathematics has limited computer science. I think the author has a belief that mathematics is a one-way street: you can use mathematics but you can&#x27;t create it. This is not the case. He&#x27;s correct the standard mathematics (say, undergraduate level engineering mathematics) doesn&#x27;t model changes over time and other things that are interesting about computer systems, but this doesn&#x27;t mean that new mathematics that does model these things cannot be created (and they have). It&#x27;s also important to realise the practical limits of maths. Unless you&#x27;re a pure mathematician you don&#x27;t create maths for the hell of it---you create it to answer some question (what is the runtime of this code? Is it memory-safe?) Modelling everything is hard so you only model enough to answer the question of interest.<p>I agree that there is an artistic aspect to programming, and I can think of two interesting applications to this. Firstly is to study programming as an art, and this is something the relatively new Programming journal and conference (see <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;programming-journal.org&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;programming-journal.org&#x2F;</a>) is trying to do. I think it&#x27;s early days yet and we don&#x27;t really have good vocabulary or processes for this study. The second is to use teaching techniques from art, such as studio learning, for programming. I think this could be really valuable and is very under-explored."

"Write your own simple 3d fluid or rigid body simulation, and a 3d renderer to display the simulation. (It could be a video game...)

Some people get it through proofs and equations, but I feel like the way math is taught in school doesn’t usually do a great job of developing intuitions. Coding it up forces me to learn it, and playing with it and tweaking a lot along the way helps develop the intuition."

I now live in Europe because in part it reminds me of the nice life I experienced there -- focus on family and community rather than the atomistic, anonymized individual of the big city.  Europeans support families (and in particular raising kids) better than Americans do.<p>I sometimes talk with Americans about the problem of urban privilege, and the fact that urban Americans a) can&#x27;t usually understand where rural Americans are coming from and b) see themselves as superior.  Every point you can make about white privilege applies to the urbanites and the urban&#x2F;rural split as well.  I have lived in Sweden, which reminds me very much of rural Utah culturally, and in Germany which strikes me more like where I lived in rural Washington State.<p>I love how this guy seems to have made it across this divide both ways, and come to understand the quiet strength, admirable characteristics, dignity, and community that lies behind rural life and to understand the fact that this urban privilege can be seen through (as he calls back-row rather than front-row)."

"I came across a comment on HN not too long ago that really resonated with me. The commenter mentioned that they do not comment to have a conversation with the OP. Instead, they treat commenting as writing notes about the topic at hand. Because of this, they don&#x27;t expect responses or anticipate an argument (or even conversation). They mark down their thoughts and move on. It&#x27;s been a really effective mindset for me thus far ad has shaped my responses for the better."
"This makes sense, Uber should be a premium service, back in my day having a private driver on call was expensive as it should be, the wear and tear om the vehicle is ridiculous, the vehicles are nice.

"Granted, I live &#x27;up north&#x27; but it still gets hot in my new house.  I mounted some exhaust fans in the ceiling to pull the hot air from where it naturally rises too.

"Looking at the ruby docs, my interpretation is that if a gem is published only on github registry, there&#x27;s no good way to use it as an indirect dependency (no good way for a gem to list it as a dependency) -- any app using such a thing would have to know the list of all of these indirect dependencies on github registry, and list them individually in the top-level Gemfile, along with their correct github source.<p>This seems to limit the utility for ruby. I&#x27;m not sure if other supported platforms have similar issues?<p>You could already do a lot of what github registry for ruby does by using an existing feature where you could already point to a git repo (not just GH) in your `Gemfile`. What this adds is just the ability to resolve multiple versions from github using ordinary rubygems resolution. The existing feature forced you to manually specify a tag (hoping there was a predictable tag for a version) or SHA, or use whatever is on master HEAD."

"Maybe I&#x27;m just an old man at this point, but I find &quot;imperfection&quot; rather charming.  Realism can be cool, but games and cartoons that are &quot;crappy&quot; have character and allow me to use my imagination to believe in different worlds.  One of the reasons that I still love Nintendo 64 games is that they look clunky compared to today&#x27;s games, and they look that way because the artists had to work within the constraints of the hardware and come up with game assets that look close enough but don&#x27;t destroy the FPS.  If a game looks consistently crappy, I can buy into its universe with my imagination.<p>I forget who said it, but I think there&#x27;s a saying that great art is borne through limitation.  When an a good artist only has a limited set of tools, or maybe not even the best ones, it brings out the best in their abilities."

"One golden rule of businesses (or any investments) is that you should not put your eggs to single basket. With development of mobile apps you just do it, you are totally in mercy of a couple of gatekeepers, like it or not.

"I don&#x27;t think this is about &quot;your employer owning you&quot;.  I also don&#x27;t think this is about capitalism (which is just private property, economic freedom, and a government to enforce those two things).  Instead, I think the pressure to work so much comes from society, which wields incredible control over all of us.<p>More specifically, I believe that the 40-hour work-week is a consequence of the ascension of wealth creation as the primary goal of our societies.  Past civilizations, rich and poor, did not see the creation of wealth as their raison d&#x27;etre.  Modern civilizations do and, as a result, we&#x27;re sacrificing everything else (autonomy, privacy, free time, family, etc) at the altar of wealth-creation.<p>It&#x27;s not all bad: wealth makes people&#x27;s lives better.  But there are downsides (like overwork, the feeling that you have no control over your life, the feeling that your life lacks meaning, lack of meaningful social relationships, and so on).<p>I&#x27;m borrowing this argument from Hannah Arendt.  I find her incredibly convincing: she sees this whole process as having kicked off with the Reformation, which resulted in the expropriation of ecclesiastical property in Europe that had been serving as the commons.  Since then, we&#x27;ve never had much of a commons and wealth creation has slowly become the primary goal."

"I wonder what the modding support is going to actually be like.<p>I&#x27;m the one of the two original coauthors of the Kopernicus mod (although I handed off development of it to Dorian years ago when I got my first job after graduation because I was having trouble finding time while settling into working life). Writing that mod was already difficult as hell, because while the game supported mods, there was no SDK or any supporting documentation. There was essentially a gentleman&#x27;s agreement between the KSP modding scene and the developers that ripping apart the game assemblies for the purposes of making mods wasn&#x27;t didn&#x27;t violate the terms of service, even though it explicitly forbid such activities.<p>Building Kopernicus by spending days in the Mono .NET Assembly Decompiler figuring out how to override pieces of the game to make the custom solar systems was pretty darn fun though. I can&#x27;t tell you how much time I spent trying to figure out how to programmatically make something that PSystem.systemPrefab would accept as a Unity Prefab object. Or the fun of learning about attributes in .NET to build a reflection based configuration system that would actually process KSP&#x27;s configuration file format into said systemPrefab object.<p>One of the things that the modding community felt at the time was that as Take-Two starting getting more aggressive about hiding the way the internals of the game worked (it&#x27;s very murky if said gentleman&#x27;s agreement is still in place), and in it&#x27;s place producing some documentation, that the way forward may be just making an open source KSP-style game with original content and a completely different engine as to avoid any legal problems (we&#x27;d all seen how the internals of KSP worked, so we needed to make sure to do ours entirely differently). But no one (including myself) really ever found the time to work on it or made a serious effort to do so...<p>If they solved the performance issues with large ships, and have somewhat more realistic physics (e.g. Lagrange points&#x2F;Parking orbits are impossible in KSP), that may just be cause to drop the idea completely. I&#x27;ve mainly found my time spent exploring the depths of orbital integrators, Eric Bruneton&#x27;s atmosphere paper, and Vulkan."

"Let&#x27;s talk about any good parts.<p>The architecture of systems varies enough that there isn&#x27;t a good concrete definition. An aspect that&#x27;s important for one system isn&#x27;t for another so it&#x27;s hard to say which aspects are part of an architecture. Unless you&#x27;re always architecting the same types of systems, this will carry some weight.<p>The other idea that architecture is present but not visible is a great one. It&#x27;s the important bits that are underlying or overarching or otherwise permeates the system without necessarily being separately visible. I&#x27;ve had so many difficult chats talking past one another about different levels of concern. When one side only sees what&#x27;s named or in the diffs, it&#x27;s hard to convey why something else is more important when there&#x27;s a lack of &#x27;shared understanding&#x27;.<p>I did have this experience when I was making a relay service which handled a headless browser and audio streams. Each of these ended up using a state machine so I separated the state machine mechanics and implemented each using it. The result ended up having many state machine visible parts than the interesting (for the use-case) non-state-machine parts. I undid all that and made each back to primarily do its job as a state-machine but it was far less visible. This isn&#x27;t the best of examples but it&#x27;s one where I learned that sometimes you want things to be less invisible even when it&#x27;s important."

"I really like this concept, and I&#x27;ve been using an npm package called inliner which does this too: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.npmjs.com&#x2F;package&#x2F;inliner"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.npmjs.com&#x2F;package&#x2F;inliner</a><p>I&#x27;m glad there&#x27;s more people taking a look at the use case, and I&#x27;d be interested to see a list of similar solutions.<p>If you combine this with Chrome&#x27;s headless mode, you can prerender many pages that use JavaScript to perform the initial render, and then once you&#x27;re done send it to one of these tools that inlines all the resources as data URLs.<p><pre><code>  &#x2F;Applications&#x2F;Google\ Chrome.app&#x2F;Contents&#x2F;MacOS&#x2F;Google\ Chrome .&#x2F;site&#x2F;index.md.html --headless --dump-dom --virtual-time-budget=400
</code></pre>
The result is that you get pages that load very fast and are a single HTML file with all resources embedded. Allowing the page to prerender before inlining will also allow you to more easily strip all the JavaScript in many cases for pages that aren&#x27;t highly interactive once rendered."
"You have a sphere. How do you distribute sensors over the surface of the sphere so you can accurate measure the true average temperature of the sphere?<p>If you have one sensor, you can&#x27;t measure an average. Add a sensor on the other size and you have a better chance of measuring an average but still a lot of room for error.<p>Now add 100 more. If they are evenly distribute over the surface of the sphere you&#x27;re likely to get a reasonable approximation of average.<p>If, however, all those sensors are cluster around a single pole, then you effectively get accurate of measurement comparable to when you only had a single sensor.<p>With this all in mind how are the world&#x27;s sensors whose data is the basis of this article arranged on Planet Earth and do we know how much that deviates from actual average temperature?<p>The reason I pose this because the majority of people live in places with temperatures agreeable to the human body and many of the humanities sensors will be measuring these places but won&#x27;t include what&#x27;s happening in all the other areas of the world that are generally outside that livable range.<p>Just something to think about when we talk about global averages."

"I was lead developer for a company ten years ago who developed tools for industrial companies. We had a steel rack manufacturer approach us with a panic inducing spreadsheet of the calculations they needed. It was 8 very full worksheets and included everything you could think of, including seismic data by zip code.<p>To build this proper was going to take our small team at least a couple months. The sales people didn’t like this. I had an idea however to extend a SpreadsheetML parser I’d written a few years prior with a formula evaluator. I had a prototype working within a couple days, I reimplemented a large number of Excel functions warts and all, and since Excel saved all the last computed values along side the formulas it was easy to automatically test. It was the first project that really taught me the value of unit testing.<p>It was a fun project and took around a month in the end, which was still over the amount of time sales had given us. The client actually sent us a fair number of revisions to the spreadsheet such that had we built it out any other way would have been a major project, but was as easy as swapping the spreadsheet the tool read. I left the company a few months later but I was sad to hear from coworkers they never did anything else with the tool. I thought it was a really neat hack."
"I&#x27;m skeptical for the following reasons:<p>1. Companies like Twilio largely created the explosion in spam calls by providing extremely cheap, programmable calls, so I&#x27;m always a little skeptical when the company selling the poison is also selling the antidote.
2. I really don&#x27;t like the idea of a single company being responsible for a global verification system for something like phone calls. How are decisions made over what is verified (e.g. the example shows &quot;call purpose&quot; snippets on the screen - if I put something there saying &quot;I have an important flight update&quot;, but then my call is &quot;You&#x27;re only getting free peanuts on your flight, but if you enroll in this MileagePlus card you&#x27;ll get snack mix too!&quot; who judges that?)<p>Overall I&#x27;d just say with all the consolidation of power with US tech giants I am extremely wary of giving them anything else that could consolidate that power further.

"I agree to use protocols, and not platforms (it would be better to do that rather than what a lot of stuff including Hacker News are doing). I wrote my own software for IRC and NNTP (both client-side and server-side), but you don&#x27;t have to use mine and you can use your own or others too. Regardless of protocol services are still required, but you can use other services with the same protocol; you can set up your own server if you do not want to (or cannot) use theirs, for example. And, SMTP is good for email, compared with having to use a web browser. (And, there still are free Usenet servers (some require registration and some don&#x27;t).)<p>Decentralized systems also will help. However, I think ActivityPub and so on are too complicated; NNTP and IRC is good. Also, sometimes some federation with others might not be wanted, or only partially, or whatever reason; sometimes the policy also might not match what someone else has. That is one reason I write a specification of Unusenet, which specifies a format for newsgroup hierarchies which are not part of Usenet (it is possible for the same server to feed both Usenet and Unusenet, though). Perhaps I think even should set up a NNTP for Hacker News, too. (I also invented a Netsubscribe protocol, which could be a simpler alternative to ActivityPub&#x2F;Mastodon.)<p>Let&#x27;s Make Internet Great Again"

It may be that one teaching method or another makes certain weaknesses easier to identify or fix, but in the end, enough dedicated practice is going to sort out these weaknesses either way.<p>The article presents this as though context is bad - but you need context to bridge from the start to the end of the process.<p>The article repeatedly says &quot;poor reader&quot; when it is really talking about a stage of learning to read (the anecdotes describe people stuck on this stage).<p>In my opinion:

"The author&#x27;s comments on cache sizes are a bit reductive. Not all &quot;L3&quot; is created equal, and designers always make tradeoffs between capacity and latency.<p>In particular, the EPYC processors achieve such high cache capacities by splitting L3 into slices across multiple silicon dies, and accessing non-local L3 incurs huge interconnect latency - 132ns on latest EPYC vs 37ns on current Xeon [1]. Even DDR4 on Intel (90ns) is faster than much of an EPYC chip&#x27;s L3 cache.<p>Intel&#x27;s monolithic die strategy keeps worst case latency low, but increases costs significantly and totally precludes caches in the hundreds of MB.

"&gt; However, the programmer failed to inform the compiler that the call to ereport(ERROR,...) does not return. This implies that the division will always execute.<p>I don’t think that’s correct.  The compiler is allowed to assume that functions marked noreturn do not return, but it’s not allowed to assume that functions <i>not</i> marked noreturn <i>do</i> return.  In other words, it’s not undefined behavior for a function to call abort(), enter an infinite loop, etc. instead of returning.  It would be very strange if it were!<p>There’s a somewhat related spec clause that lets the compiler assume that certain types of loops will eventually terminate [1], but that doesn’t apply here.  Therefore I think the mentioned compiler optimization is illegal.  The issue was reported back in 2011; it would be interesting to see whether newer versions of GCC, or Clang, behave the same way.<p>[1] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackoverflow.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;16436237&#x2F;is-while1-undefined-behavior-in-c"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackoverflow.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;16436237&#x2F;is-while1-undef...</a>"
"I Loved your article, I translated it to spanish for some friends that can not read english at all.

"If the problem is that too much capital is flowing from productive investments, like tech, to unproductive land speculation then perhaps part of the solution is to capture part of that windfall gain through a land value tax [1], i.e. a tax on just the land and not the buildings, thereby reducing the speculative component from housing investment without reducing incentive to develop more housing stock.<p>[1] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Land_value_tax"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Land_value_tax</a>"

"As a Fulani, when I was growing up there weren&#x27;t any official alphabet. Some people wrote in Arabic, other&#x27;s in the latin letters using french phonetics and agreed upon combinations for those new sounds. (ie Bhe, dhe, etc.) I only know Fulani orally.<p>But around 2002, if I remember correctly, Guinean students from the University of Azhar in Egypt, started working on a new alphabet. They agreed on using latin letters for familiar sounds, since most of Fulanis speak french anyway. They added new letters for those particularly Fulani sounds.<p>I remember being there in a small college bedroom where they were all gathered around the computer. It had a Pentium III and they were excited about a new Pentium 4 machine that someone had donated but they didn&#x27;t get the chance to install it yet. I don&#x27;t remember if the two brothers were there since those names are extremely common for Fulani (yes, my name is Ibrahima too).<p>I was there to get a hair cut, and along the way they told me the computer had issues. All I did was go to windows Registry, and delete the files that automatically started at boot.<p>The script in this article is new to me, never saw it before. I read books in the one they made in Egypt, since it&#x27;s easy to pick up.

"Autism is called a disorder, but I think that that&#x27;s a pretty negative term for it. People with autism may be a minority, and that makes the condition abnormal, but in itself autism isn&#x27;t a bad thing; it&#x27;s how they relate to the world that make autism &quot;bad.&quot; Instead autism is merely different.<p>I think we can treat autism like any other subject. For example, some children start reading earlier than others, and other than extreme cases we don&#x27;t say that they have a reading disorder. We simply recognize that some people have more difficulty than others learning to read. Can we do the same with social skills? Simply have a dedicated class with structured learning, and recognize that not everyone learns social cues at the same rate?"

"To those interested, the Urantia book describes our individualized purpose as to becoming increasingly conscious by evolving and becoming progressively more spiritual until we can understand God the Father. It describes evolution not just as a species, but within each of us; and that actually God created us purposely to evolve and become like Him, for reasons still unclear to them.<p>Kegan&#x27;s theories and philosophies seem similar, but the Human soul would not just be limited to 5 potential stages, as Kegan described. Probably, Kegan himself has been limited to acquiring just a 5th stage, but these stages are possibly unlimited.<p>According to the Urantia book, by eventually becoming so spiritual, the body can no longer contain the Spirit, so it will automatically proceed to a next stage bypassing death, like what happened to Jesus Christ, Elijah the Prophet, and Enoch in the Holy Bible."
"&quot;Why would you care what order we were sending the name value pairs for this?&quot; The article makes it sound like it&#x27;s somehow IBM&#x27;s fault. However, questions about preserving order in hashes&#x2F;associative arrays&#x2F;maps&#x2F;whatchamacallit span at least thirty years. Some applications of the format even demand it (e.g. ansible uses YAML - a superset of JSON - or even straight JSON for it playbooks; emitting them out of order is not an option).<p>Every time the issue surfaces it elicits a large amount of eye rolling among the cognoscenti. However, I&#x27;m a firm believer in the idea that recurring demands from the user base need to be addressed, rather then mocked. The coding community appears to me notably tone deaf on this.<p>&#x27;Course anybody can use &lt;insert suitable technique&gt; to send a JSON map in the desired order, except the parser on the other hand will blissfully disregard it. Or you can devise any ordered solution on both ends, which will leave you outside of the accepted standard and open you up to the situation described in the article (where the requirement may well have been frivolous).<p>I can remember very few - if any - instances of somebody implying that the standard should somehow make room for this kind of scenarios. The standard reply was &quot;use a different format&quot; or &quot;change the requirement&quot;. (Somehow remembers me of people asking what can one do to have whitespace-preserving XML, and at least one amusing story about that)"

"There&#x27;s a lot of comments here already so I don&#x27;t know if this has been addressed already, but I don&#x27;t get this shell. It seems to be fixing a problem that doesn&#x27;t exist, and a lot of comments are echoing it. Current shells are not deficient, as Doug McIlroy originally stated, the universal interface is text and tools should take input and generate output based on this. You obviously can then pipe things together with these tools not necessarily knowing in advance how they will be used in a pipeline. You can get very far with sed, awk, etc, you just have to spend a little bit of time learning them, but they are not complicated. You can of course then introduce a command like jq for specialised purposes. But hte point is the shell isn&#x27;t providing this, they are separate tools that you orchestrate using the shell. There is not a flaw with how it works at the moment, I truly believe and this isn&#x27;t a dig at this project or anyone in particular, that people do not spend enough time learning these tools that have been there for decades. The re-inventions that appear on GitHub are not a product of the deficiency of the existing tools, I don&#x27;t know what they are but it&#x27;s not that. Unless I am missing something."

"From the article: &quot;People with Asperger’s syndrome, the term still commonly used for one of the most well-known forms of autism spectrum disorder, bring serious advantages to the financial markets: extreme focus, a facility with numbers, a willingness to consider unpopular opinions, a strong sense of logic, and an intense belief in fairness and justice. But, like other autistic employees, they often feel alienated from their managers, colleagues, and clients. Sometimes they simply get fired.&quot;<p>I wonder if these people were always fired, or has something in the business changed that made immoderate instances of these traits a liability? Tech has changed in the last decade, to where I don&#x27;t think someone &quot;on the spectrum,&quot; could survive very long in a west coast company without being preyed upon by people who trade on other attributes.<p>Using Pfeffer&#x27;s triad of &quot;Performance, Credentials, Relationships,&quot; businesses seem to evolve to where success becomes weighted to the latter two instead of purely on performance. Arbitrage, startups, and other asymmetric, high risk plays could seem to benefit from high performing people on the spectrum, where people in later stage businesses that have more linear growth or stability benefit from the latter two.<p>To me, the trouble with the most functional edge of the &quot;spectum,&quot; view as presented is it seems to both normalize groupthink and some of the more shameful characteristics of political operators, and pathologizes clear reasoning and principle.<p>I get that expecting others to be accountable to my or any other general ethical rules is to choose suffering, but the tendency to pseudo-medicalize people as &quot;on the spectrum,&quot;  who lose politically feels ominous."

"Major respect to Stripe for starting this program, as this helps solve a real problem in the carbon dioxide removal (CDR) field. At Project Vesta (thanks for the shoutout[1]), while we have a plan for individuals to pay for their CO2 removal by donating directly for a specific tonnage of olivine to be placed on a beach in their name, all of the investors&#x2F;fund advisors who have approached us and are interested in getting into the CDR field, have generally been limited in that they can only make investments into an organization if there is a way to get a financial return. They can&#x27;t put money in non-profits, even to potentially help &quot;save the world,&quot; as they are still operating with a fiduciary responsibility and for-profit motives. If no one is paying for carbon removal, there is no business. For scientists and others trying to create carbon removal solutions, this represents a major problem, as no matter how good or cheap their CDR technique is, they also have to come up with a market of who will buy their CDR &quot;product.&quot;<p>So even though many groups&#x2F;companies want to get involved in CDR, if there is no market for paying for &quot;CDR as a product,&quot; investors will not put money in. Having Stripe and other companies guarantee payment for carbon dioxide removal would actually make a real difference in helping to spur the CDR market. Companies would be able to point at who will buy their &quot;product&quot; and at what price, and then investors would be able to invest.<p>Creating a carbon price is the most obvious and simple solution to make the &quot;free market&quot; solve a problem created by the inefficiency of the &quot;free market&quot; in the first place, of not pricing in the real world cost of the externalities from each tonne of CO2 released. The emitters should have to pay because each tonne of carbon put out into the atmosphere causes economic damage in terms of health effects and more. Some 30,000 people die prematurely in the US each year due to air pollution, yet most emitters do not pay these costs[2].<p>This is termed the &quot;social cost of carbon&quot; (SCC) and based on estimates from the U.S. governmental Interagency Working Group in 2013, each 1 metric ton of CO2 released is said to have an SCC of around $37 (2007 USD).[3] So even though there is a consensus among most scientists and economists that there should be a carbon price, and companies technically owe around $37&#x2F;tonne, no one is sure when it will occur or at what price it will be at. This uncertainty and lack of a large scale market is what prevents major private investments into large scale carbon dioxide removal (CDR) technologies.<p>It is particularly frustrating because if the free market was truly rational, polluters would be paying for the externalities on their CO2 emissions, and the CDR field would blossom. By creating a market themselves and also offering to pay at a range of prices (even though there may be cheaper options available), Stripe can help foster CDR companies when they are most vulnerable, helping them breakthrough their technological learning curves and achieve scale. At the very least, just keeping companies subsidized and advancing technologically until the world corrects this economic error, is a worthy cause.<p>Having a guaranteed CO2 removal price would allow these companies to just focus on their technology and not have to individually force the global economic system to price carbon, in order to be viable. So again, great job Stripe in starting this, and to other companies&#x2F;organizations, please start similar initiatives.<p>[1] &quot;Interesting ideas include crushing rock with natural forces&quot; [<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ProjectVesta.org"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ProjectVesta.org</a>]<p>[2] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnn.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;07&#x2F;23&#x2F;health&#x2F;air-pollution-us-deaths-study&#x2F;index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnn.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;07&#x2F;23&#x2F;health&#x2F;air-pollution-us-death...</a><p>[3] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.edf.org&#x2F;sites&#x2F;default&#x2F;files&#x2F;expertconsensusreport.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.edf.org&#x2F;sites&#x2F;default&#x2F;files&#x2F;expertconsensusrepor...</a>"

"Regarding &quot;Seek Out Problems and Iterate&quot;, it&#x27;s a bit of an understatement how important this is. I&#x27;ve invested a lot of time helping my coworkers understand the distinction between tasks and problems. The end goal being only tracking problems in the ticketing system. It&#x27;s not easy to do this and it takes constant effort, but it pays off very quickly. I&#x27;ve yet to see a real &quot;problem&quot; ticket stay unresolved for a long time, whereas &quot;task&quot; tickets tend to stay around until they&#x27;re either irrelevant or they get closed after getting kicked between a few people.<p>A good example of this is:<p>- Add worker thread for X to offload Y<p>When the actual problem is more along the lines of:<p>- Latency spikes on Tuesdays at 3pm in main thread<p>Which may be caused by a cronjob kicking off and hogging disk IO for a few minutes.<p>A good rule of thumb I&#x27;ve found is that task tickets tend to have exactly one way of solving them, whereas problem tickets can be solved in many ways."

"I am Russian, and I consider the author to be mostly right. Indeed, we hold our literature to be the most valued of all arts; there were many Russian painters, and musicians, and architects, but these classical novelists (and poets) will always have a special place in our hearts.<p>The French have probably the closest level of respect to their men and women of letters, but their ideal is an intellectual in general, not necessarily the novelist. For the Germans, their beacons of culture are their philosophers. For the Americans — their inventors and visionaries, nowhere else they have achieved so much respect and so many accolades. But for us, Russians, — our idols are indeed our novelists."

"To me the key question is: Why is iMessage not a normal iOS app?<p>We&#x27;ve seen numerous iMessage bugs over the years inc. full OS take-overs (often used for jailbreak), soft bricking (endless restarts due to corrupt notifications&#x2F;requiring a factory reset), crashes that reboot the phone (once), and a bunch of potential for escalation&#x2F;code execution.<p>None of this is possible with apps in the normal iOS sandbox. The apps themselves would crash, but they&#x27;re context confined, they cannot bring down the underlying OS, write invalid notifications, or cause a kernel panic.<p>But they&#x27;ve designed iMessage to act like a part of the underlying OS for no real reason. You could very easily hand off the most hazardous parts of iMessage&#x27;s inner workings into the app&#x27;s context, or even another user space&#x2F;context confined service, and just let them crash like normal apps do.<p>Ten years ago it was common for font processing to happen in the kernel. This was problematic because front processing is hard, and bugs occur. Since then we&#x27;ve seen many migrate fonts into userland. Why is iMessage&#x27;s security model so far behind the times, it is a lot less critical&#x2F;performance impacted than fonts, but yet has worse security than most font systems in 2019?"

South African experience. I buy a fair number of items on Aliexpress. Stuff you can never get in any store here. I use the Post Office to ship because courier is just too expensive. It takes 40 to 60 days to arrive. The hold up appears to be the SA Post Office. Since a few months ago the Post Office now charges approximately US$2 processing fee for each package. Its a fair charge I guess but there hasn&#x27;t been any improvement in delivery times. Sometimes stuff arrives after so long that I have forgotten why I ordered it.
"&gt; For many years, database users did not have to simultaneously understand the concept of isolation levels and consistency levels<p>This statement might technically be true, but it hasn&#x27;t been the case for many years, including much of the time that &quot;CAP Theorem&quot; has been a part of popular discourse in industry.

Wish more companies would think about their hiring practices from first principles and didn&#x27;t just copy Google"

BBQ guns make a dull sound, really a inconsequential noise compared to the death it brought that morning. The tiny bird fell to the ground and I realized I had not only hit it but killed it.

"It&#x27;s (almost) funny to see how Google &quot;reframe&quot; the concept of privacy to preserve its business model !!!<p>- &quot;large scale blocking of cookies undermine people’s privacy by encouraging opaque techniques such as fingerprinting&quot;... so it means: one way or another, it&#x27;s OK to gather as much information as possible to show relevant (targeted and weel paid) ads. But there are good ways (cookies) and bad ways (fingerprinting).<p>- &quot;blocking cookies without another way to deliver relevant ads significantly reduces publishers’ primary means of funding&quot;. And what about delivering &quot;standard&quot; ads ???? Newspapers have shown non-targeted ads for years and nobody complained about that (I mean... except marketers maybe). If publishers stopped relying on targeted ads, maybe they may at last find some really new business model (like shared subscription) instead of just being lazy, using Google&#x2F;Facebook products ?<p>- &quot;If this funding is cut, we are concerned that we will see much less accessible content for everyone&quot;, meaning...? Oh... less things to show on google search engine and with AMP. As Google is not producing content by itself but using (stealing?) content produced by others, it&#x27;s quite understandable that their bottom line is tied up to the content publishers providing free content.

"An interesting exercise. OP is still creating something for consumption, though. This is an old argument:<p>SOCRATES: You know, Phaedrus, writing shares a strange feature with painting. The offsprings of painting stand there as if they are alive, but if anyone asks them anything, they remain most solemnly silent. The same is true of written words. You’d think they were speaking as if they had some understanding, but if you question anything that has been said because you want to learn more, it continues to signify just that very same thing forever. When it has once been written down, every discourse roams about everywhere, reaching indiscriminately those with understanding no less than those who have no business with it, and it doesn’t know to whom it should speak and to whom it should not. And when it is faulted and attacked unfairly, it always needs its father’s support; alone, it can neither defend itself nor come to its own support. -- Plato. c.399-347 BCE. “Phaedrus.” Pp. 551-552 in Complete Works<p>tldr: Debate, discourse."

There will always be more of them.<p>2. &quot;One and done.&quot;  Don&#x27;t get into back-and-forth arguments.  I try to limit myself to one post on a topic and then do my best to remain silent.  I don&#x27;t always succeed, but I try.  Some people simply <i>cannot</i> be wrong and no amount of back-and-forth will make them change their mind.  Let them have the last word.<p>3. &quot;You might be the one who is wrong&quot;.  Tying into #2, if you engage in back-and-forth&#x27;s it easily becomes a game where you have to prove you&#x27;re right.  If you shut up and listen after saying your piece, you might actually find yourself more willing to consider other points of view.<p>4. &quot;Political issues usually lack easy answers.&quot; If you&#x27;re talking about politics, remember that political opinions are highly dependent on a person&#x27;s point of view.

If an opinion is unequivocally correct from all points of view it&#x27;s probably not going to be politically interesting or controversial."

"Do you know why work is so much more productive? Because so much is automated away, and relies on machines. Each and every worker works using lots of machines. Of course, the more machines you can make work the more productivity you have.<p>When a large part of your work can&#x27;t be delegated to machines, for instance nursing a baby, talking to people face to face, etc (mostly &quot;human relations&quot; things) then your productivity can&#x27;t augment as much. This is also why &quot;human work&quot; earns less than &quot;things work&quot;.<p>Do you know what machines use to work? Energy. In the end, energy availability is the ultimate constraint.

"I think machine learned grading of papers is insane, but at the same time I don&#x27;t think we should be training or encouraging students to speak in AAVE (as the article suggests).<p>I think the right approach for machine learned systems is to automatically &quot;whitelist&quot; essays rather than &quot;blacklisting&quot; them. Students in the middle of the distribution of essays aren&#x27;t really interesting, so whitelist them, give them a pass. Those at the extremes can be either exceptional or terrible, but usually terrible. The judgement of those at the extremes should be decided by a human, not a machine. You wouldn&#x27;t want to blacklist the Einstein of essays because he did something genius that is indistinguishable from insanity.<p>However, I think there are some essays that can automatically be blacklisted. For example, those with:<p>1. Plagiarism (perhaps human moderated)<p>2. Extremely low word count<p>3. Extremely high count of fake words<p>And at the end of the day, these essay assignments aren&#x27;t there to judge whether a student is the next writing sensation; they are given to judge whether the student can write legible sentences and words, to ensure they are prepared for the future. So perhaps it is at least possible to automatically blacklist on sentence structure and spelling (you should just lose points for invalid structure or invalid words, you shouldn&#x27;t gain points for big words or complicated sentences). To make this fair, the student should be informed of this requirement. If they are informed and still fail, then they need to be remediated. If we discover that a disproportionate number of minorities are getting blacklisted, then we should investigate why the school is failing to teach them proper sentence structure and spelling, not pretend we can change the world to make AAVE an acceptable dialect of english in the workplace."

I am someone who craves alone time. That means no music, no podcasts, no computer, no noise, no people. I am quite happy with a book and a writing pad. I want to be left alone to have a certain kind of inward experience.<p>As a side note, I have always felt that the point of reading is not to remember everything you have read, it is more to shape the way you think. And we might remember more of what we read if we would stop reading about other people&#x27;s reading and productivity habits, and just keep to ourselves. But I digress.<p>Sometimes people ask what it is I am working on, or what it is I do by myself all of the time. The answer, of course, is not a whole lot. Ours is a society that celebrates participation and creativity, yet I feel no pressure to create for the sake of creating, or to share for the sake of sharing. And I do not feel guilty or lazy for not &quot;producing&quot; anything of note. If there is a hell, it is full of groups of people doing group activities, and I am required to participate and create and talk about whatever it is we are doing for eternity. What a nightmare.<p>To be sure, I have written plenty. But what I am driving at is that a lot of the writing or &quot;creative work&quot; I do is for my eyes only. Sometimes I think about sharing an essay, but I have to pause to ask myself if I want to share because I have something to say, or if I want to share because I am seeking validation. Most of the time, the desire to create comes not from some quiet space inside of me, but from the side of me that wants to be seen and heard. I find that the quality of my writing, or any creative work, is far better when it comes from the right mental state, rather than from an abstract sense of urgency that I should be creating something, anything.<p>On another note, having thought about this for awhile now, the deep need for solitude is part of who I am, but also a compensatory reaction to being connected all of the time. Whether we realize it or not, we spend the better half of our days in a sympathetic state. This has consequences, I think, that are different for everyone. Eventually, you have to deal with the residue of living and working at a pace that is often not of your own making. Sometimes you have to get your bearings before the creative spark comes back. That can take longer than expected.<p>In closing, it is worth paying attention to the kind of creativity that comes from helping a friend or lover make something better. Even though the project is not of your own making, being able to add a touch of your creative insight is intellectually rewarding in a unique way."
"Rabbit holes are why I grew to love Haskell and pure-functional programming in general.  For better or worse, Haskell (Agda, Idris...) doesn&#x27;t let you compromise very often.<p>You could argue that this is terrible for productivity, and you might be right, but at the same time, means that a lot of people have done a lot of research on how to do things the &quot;right&quot; way in Haskell, and any project I&#x27;ve done with the language has led me to learning a whole slew of new things about type theory, category theory, and PL theory in general, which I can then take and apply to &quot;productive&quot; languages."
"Solar roads seem like a very expensive and thus fixed alternative, when we have a big enough expense ahead of us moving HVAC, transportation, manufacturing, etc. to green sources. Keeping solar generation separate is more flexible.<p>It&#x27;s also worth considering that we may choose to move away from big, expensive, fossil-based roadways to more compact, inexpensive and &#x27;smart road&#x27; options."

So normally I read 30 to 40 % of municipal waste is organic. There is a lot of interesting work being done in accelerating that conversion to proteins and fats via insets.

Dumping&#x2F;delegating mundane tasks onto a high income earner doesn&#x27;t jive with common sense.

"&gt; two modules will tend to grow ever more dependent on each other unless separated by hard (&#x27;physical&#x27;) boundaries<p>This is especially true in monorepos. Code resuse has it&#x27;s benefits, but left unchecked the dependency graph can turn into a huge highly-connected glob. Modules end up accidentally importing code they have no business importing because of sneaky transitive dependencies. The blast radius of even small simple changes becomes enormous, and testing&#x2F;debugging becomes more and more complex.<p>A great way to keep this in check is to have apply code isolation in the test environment. When you checkout the entire repo for a build or test, its easy for these kinds of dependencies to grow unnoticed. But if you require build&#x2F;test targets to explicitly declare what code they depend on (and only make that code present when running them), changes to the dependency structure must be explicitly acknowledged in code review. This is one of the core principles behind build tools like Bazel."

"A few thoughts:<p>* Amazon is a total mess right now, and this is great investigative reporting. I think Amazon is going to go through a rough year or two in PR terms. They need to get this under control quickly.<p>* Amazon can pretend that it&#x27;s just a platform, but in practice they benefit from consumers assuming that everything on the site has some stamp of approval (even if it&#x27;s not as full a stamp as, say, buying the item from Costco.) Right now, they&#x27;re abusing that consumer trust by doing a lousy job of monitoring product listings on their site. Over the long term, they risk losing that trust altogether. That&#x27;s a huge risk to them, and it&#x27;s a little short-sighted to take no ownership of product listings on their site as the basis for legal defense.<p>* This reminds me of the recent reporting about AirBnb dealing with scammy listings in Canada [0]. I <i>think</i> that both AirBnb and Amazon are capable of getting these problems under control, but they haven&#x27;t proven it as of yet. When the solution comes, it will be expensive and involve a lot of human labor. That is true no matter how many times they wave their magics wands and yell &quot;Machine Learning!&quot;<p>* Some of the violations pointed out here are pretty dumb.

"So is drop shipping from China now dead?<p>A major benefit of drop shipping from China was the pretty much $1 shipping for almost any item via ePacket.<p>Obviously the products are still cheaper, but with a 25% tariff on most goods, and what I can only assume will be a close to DHL price for shipping, a t-shirt drop shipped from China will probably cost more than one made and shipped domestically.<p>To continue to be competitive, drop shippers are going to have to think about bulk imports and warehousing, thus no longer being drop shippers."

That’s understandable, because much of its DNA comprises genes for building a dog. It can afford to let those mutate into obsolescence. But over time, the genes that it still needs will also take hits. Slowly, the tumor will become weaker and less efficient.<p>I wonder if there&#x27;s an analogy to governments and laws. As our laws become more complex and &quot;mutate,&quot; governments gradually become less effective."
"The problem with trying to find meaningful work is that 1. the pay is generally terrible, and hours will likely be long 2. if someone is paying you, it&#x27;s still a &quot;job&quot;, with all the implications, responsibilities, and power dynamics that go with that. You still take orders from a boss all day. And if it were so damn fun, then they probably wouldn&#x27;t be paying you for it.<p>The most fun internships&#x2F;jobs I&#x27;ve ever had were all unpaid, because I could come and go as I please, and literally work on whatever I wanted. The second you&#x27;re getting paid, your personal interests are thrown out the window, and your job is now to take orders from your boss.<p>Of course there are exceptions. I&#x27;d imagine that being a tenured professor would be pretty sweet (though getting a job like that these days is extremely difficult and competitive), or if you&#x27;re a doctor then helping save lives in Africa or something would probably be extremely fulfilling. Being a politician seems like it would feel meaningful, and they get paid solid six figure salaries.<p>But overall, the search for a meaningful job that also pays decently and doesn&#x27;t require crazy hours is like searching for a unicorn, so for most people with the talent&#x2F;luck&#x2F;opportunity of working high paying jobs, achieving financial independence first before seeking meaningful work is probably the smartest move."

"In America, at least, we should consider the legacy of slavery and indentured servitude in attitudes towards working hours.

"Writing this from an occasionally-connected hand computer in the “developing world”, <i>don&#x27;t use Encarta. Use Kiwix.</i> I have a 45000-article slice of the English Wikipedia here in 6 GB, with nearly all the pictures, and even animations and some video and audio, such as the radio broadcast of the Hindenburg crash. To give you an idea of its breadth, articles I&#x27;ve consulted recently include &quot;anal sex&quot;, &quot;rectum&quot;, &quot;convolution&quot;, &quot;ferret&quot;, &quot;Dorothy Parker&quot;, and &quot;principal component analysis&quot;. (This probably paints an unjustifiably interesting picture of my hobbies.)  The whole English Wikipedia, 4 million articles, is 35 GB without pictures.<p>(Encarta was 32000 articles and, as pointed out in <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=20741028"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=20741028</a>, ridiculously biased on some subjects, in precisely the way that Wikipedia scrupulously avoids.)<p>The biggest problem I have with Kiwix is that, on Android, its built-in downloader for ZIM files is flaky, and I haven&#x27;t figured out how to load ZIM files I downloaded in some other way yet, such as on a MicroSD card. The non-Android version works fine with such sideloaded ZIM files. (I also miss the interlanguage links; I have a few languages of Wikipedia on here, and even when I don&#x27;t it&#x27;s often useful to find out things like the Guarani word for &quot;ferret&quot;.  And of course I don&#x27;t have a local Google Search.)<p>Kiwix also has ZIM files for things like Wikisource (7.2 GB for English), Project Gutenberg (54GB for English), and Stack Overflow and other Stack Exchange sites.  The English Stack Overflow is 134 gigabytes.<p>As for the globe, a much better option than Encarta is OsmAnd~. My country is under 0.6 GB, including most of the public transit routes, down to the bus-stop level. Bonus: lat&#x2F;long links in Kiwix open in OsmAnd~.  Minus: OsmAnd~ doesn&#x27;t have any way to load satellite imagery, even the Blue Marble MODIS dataset.<p>Both Kiwix and OsmAnd~ are available on F-Droid, so you know they&#x27;re not malware.<p>But none of this is <i>interactivity</i>.  Watch Alan Kay’s talks where he talks about kids building dynamical models in Etoys to understand gravitational acceleration. Much more interesting than the Wikipedia article on convolution by itself: I have IPython, Numpy, and SciPy on my netbook, so I can create signals and kernels, convolve them, and look at the results. I can compare my own implementation of convolution to the library implementation. I can do principal component analysis with the LAPACK functions for it. <i>That&#x27;s</i> interactivity, and it&#x27;s a far more powerful learning tool than mere hypertext. And I don&#x27;t have anything like it for Android.  Is there anything?<p>An interesting thing to note about all of these — Wikipedia, OpenStreetMap, IPython, and LAPACK — is that none of them are products of capitalism.  They coexist with capitalism, but they are all products of a non-capitalist form of production, sometimes called &quot;commons-based peer production&quot;, which evidently outperforms capitalist production in certain areas just as capitalist production outperformed feudal agriculture.  The crucial question for the future of humanity, I think, is how we can extend commons-based peer production to new spheres, and the biggest obstacle seems to be artificial scarcity produced by government-granted monopolies — patent, copyright, and so on."

"It&#x27;s hard to take seriously initiatives like this. Google tracks users on a industrial scale that no other online company can match. Their digital fingerprints can be found in every corner of the web. Just why are they so obsessed with tracking users to death? I&#x27;m beginning to believe that tracking online behaviour is in the DNA of the company and that it simply can&#x27;t reign itself back. It escapes serious scrutiny, not least because the tech community would rather rush to it&#x27;s defence than scrutinise it&#x27;s practices and behaviour.<p>It has, in my view, a narrow view of privacy (shared by large swathes of the tech community) which is essentially: privacy = security. Of course, you can&#x27;t have privacy without security, but security by itself does not equal privacy. Or put another way, Google&#x27;s attitude is essentially: we&#x27;ll track you to death, but we guarantee that information will never leak from Google. The response from large swatches of the tech community: that sounds fine."

Alone in the Dark was very similar to an H.P. Lovecraft story and if that was what you were looking for that is what you would find. Relentless Twinsen’s Adventure was an intense fever dream of a fantasy that kept the player going on pure suspense and wonder. It had the dramatic finesse of Loom or a good sci-fi novel. When I purchased it I had only assumed it to be mindless entertainment. It turned out to be a statement on the human condition that was too valuable to let everyone know about. I diligently played it after school for many days giving the game my full attention. When I was finished I felt like I grew up a little and society at large did not let me down concerning the harsh truths revealed in this game. This is why I’ll never forget Relentless- the general malaise and apathy of the time in history it was released deeply contrasted against the wake-up call contained within the lessons of its gameplay. Both games we’re ahead of their time and technically very impressive.

Also the amount of cash itself is a mind game on its own. You must discreetly   research the person to see how much money they take as bribe. Too much and news about you being a newbie will spread like wild fire and all your future discussions will drain you of even more cash in discreet envelopes. Too little money and your request will get denied making you face the same person handing over another discreet envelope, and you better have at least the correct sum in there. So waste time asking for this mind game, waste cash that you&#x27;ll never be able to officially report as deductible and then start implementing the points in article.

"Wafer scale integration, the stupid idea that just won&#x27;t die :-)<p>Okay. I&#x27;m not quite that cynical but I was avidly following Trillogy Systems (Gene Amdahl started it to make super computers using a single wafer). Conceptually awesome, in practice not so much.<p>The thing that broke down in the &#x27;80s was that different parts of the system evolve at different rates. As a result your wafer computer was always going to be sub-optimal at something, whether it was memory access or an I&#x2F;O channel standard that was new, changing that part meant all new wafers and fab companies new that every time you change the masks, you have to re-qualify <i>everything</i>. Very time consuming.<p>I thought the AMD &quot;chiplet&quot; solution to making processors that could evolve outside the interconnect was a good engineering solution to this problem.<p>Dave Ditzel, of Transmeta fame, was pushing at one point a &#x27;stackable&#x27; chip. Sort of &#x27;chip on chip&#x27; like some cell phone SoCs have for memory, but generalized to allow more stacking than just 2 chips. The problem becomes getting the heat out of such a system as only the bottom chip is in contact with the substrate and the top chip with the case. Conceptually though, another angle where you could replace parts of the design without new masks for the other parts.<p>I really liked the SeaMicro clusters (tried to buy one at the previous company but it was too far off axis to pass the toy vs tool test).

"The best explanation I&#x27;ve heard for negative rates is this:<p>Imagine you have a million dollars worth of cars.  If you want to store that in a bank, you&#x27;d pay them money to do so.  Why?  Because the car has no value to the bank.  The only thing they can do is store it in the vault, which requires security personnel, space, climate control, etc.<p>Now instead you have a million dollars in cash.  In the current environment, where more people want to put money into the bank than take it out, the cash also has no value to the bank.  They can&#x27;t loan it out again because no one wants to borrow that much.  So they charge you for storing your money.  This is how they make a profit.  By slowly taking your balance, since they can&#x27;t make money loaning it out.<p>A negative interest rate basically means more people want to save money than spend money.  When the government offers negative rates, it&#x27;s because they want people to spend money instead of save it.  When a bank does it, it&#x27;s because more people are putting money in than taking it out."

It showed three things: they were not in control, if they were the usage would have be stopped. Everyone out there needed to see t%his. Two, it made it unpleasant for them to be in the headspace, which has obvious advantages. Three, it pointed out impersonators of BS because they would not call each other f@%%ot, thus helping to mitigate the spread of false information.

"Just to add to the cultural variety, in Romania, the eastern end of latin influence, &quot;marmeladă&quot; is one of 3 common kinds of fruit preserves - made by boiling fruits with no or relatively little sugar (maybe 1:10 sugar to fruit) until they harden into a paste.  Apricot and plums are the most commonly used fruit for marmelade.<p>The 2 preserve is &quot;gem&quot; (jam), which is similar, but made with some more sugar (say 4:10 upto 5:10), and ending up as more of a mush than a paste - coincidentally, this is the most common way of preserving quinces.<p>The third one is &quot;dulceață&quot; (which translates ad literam to &quot;sweetness&quot;) which is made with 1:1 sugar to fruit and ends up with whole fruit floating in a fruity sweet colored syrup (sometimes the fruit are dipped in calcium hydroxide before boiling to ensure they stay firm) - usually for strawberries, forest fruit, apricots, even peaches.<p>We also make a quince jelly called &quot;peltea&quot; (a Turkish word), a clear, stiff, extremely sweet gelatin. This seems to be the exact equivalent of Portuguese marmelada."

"Disclaimer: I served as an election judge in the 2012 general election in Arapahoe County, CO.<p>I&#x27;m so sick and tired of stories like this framing the issue of election security as a software issue or hardware issue. You can mitigate software flaws with chains of custody, tamper proof seals, bipartisan poll watchers, bipartisan election judges, and enough transparency. Most election systems in the United States employ all of these controls, which is why you have few stories of legitimate votes being discarded due to software failure or tampering.<p>If your argument is that paper ballots are more auditable or harder to hack, they are not. The same access controls above can be applied to paper, and paper is always susceptible to being destroyed, lost, or conveniently found in a clutch race. In Russia, cameras were provided at many election booths in a recent race and caught multiple instances of suspected ballot stuffing [0]. Paper products can be created at will and the requirement for ballots to be anonymous often prevents measures to prevent double voting or outright forging of votes.<p>Hackable machines are a problem, but they are not the only problem. Ultimately, it&#x27;s easier to influence an election by discarding legitimate voters from voter registration systems, selectively failing to notify voters of elections, and other indirect interference campaigns that have been known to happen. Not only are hackable machines not the biggest issue, but they turn the camera away from bigger issues like these, which decreases scrutiny on the most vulnerable parts of the system.<p>Ultimately, if you vote in an election system, you must have something you trust in the system. You need to be able to trust the body running the election, the individuals that makeup the body, or the system elements itself. If you trust the government then you can be certain that collection processes happen correctly. If you can&#x27;t trust the government, why do you think trusting the terminals that collect votes is any better? It&#x27;s like trusting your child to bring home important documents from the school about their discipline. Sure, the paper might be tamper proof or tamper evident, but if your child throws it away it&#x27;s pointless [note 1].<p>[0]: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=pH7uXZQsyHI"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=pH7uXZQsyHI</a><p>[note 1] The analogy breaks down if you talk about electronic records, and assumes that the child is the &quot;higher authority&quot; bringing the documents to you. The point is to demonstrate that tampering with reporting is much easier than tampering with the record collection."

However, I&#x27;ve found that optimising for JIT forces me into writing short and pure functions. I.e., optimising my Julia code for speed also forces me to write clean code. This is a really nice byproduct of the language design.<p>Libraries: The complaints seem somewhat thin: there is no mention of the type of unit tests that the author is missing, just a complaint that the library is less featured than some in C++ or Java. Is comparing a pre-1.0 language&#x27;s unit testing libraries to those of C++ and Java a fair thing anyway? Finding that the generated instructions of a print statement are too long for your liking also does not seem to me to be a fair criticism of the language libraries.<p>Development: Complaining about the codebase being a mishmash seems unfair to me as well. I find myself browsing source code in Julia much more than other languages. With Julia I can just dive in and generally find that what&#x27;s relevant to me underneath is also Julia.<p>[0] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;JuliaLang&#x2F;PackageCompiler.jl"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;JuliaLang&#x2F;PackageCompiler.jl</a>"

"There are 2 major data points that are forgotten in this discussion<p>#1 The founding fathers responsible for the american revolution risked everything by creating the constitution and the electoral college. They literally went against the most powerful empire in the world. They determined that the electoral college was the best system to defend the freedom of the naescent Republic.<p>Then on the other side, you have a bunch of armchair bureaucrats and talking heads trying to change the system they inherited thanks to the blood of others. They want the  benefits from the change (&quot;more votes&quot;) but should the system implode, they will surely socialize losses among USA (they wont even join the army , let alone fight for what they believe in ).<p>Then you have switzerland.  The longest continuous government in the world operates as an extreme version of Republic, giving ample powers to small groups, where they can undo anything enacted by the majority. Nothing gets done as people bicker about small things.  Majority does not get its sat. Yet the country is the most stable in the world.<p>Maybe its time to consider what is the price for changing something that was forged with the blood of tears of more brave men, and has proven to stand the test of time."
"I don&#x27;t understand the advice: &quot;Use async sparingly&quot;<p>It doesn&#x27;t make sense. Either your complete code base is async or it is not.

Much less interesting but I&#x27;ve worked in teams where &quot;zillion&quot; is a shorthand for &quot;followed by all the zeroes that fit in a word of the size we&#x27;re talking about&quot;. So 8 zillion is 0x80000000 if we&#x27;re talking about a 32 bit address space.

My money is on the gaming battery life thing triggering some automated test<p>Sorry to hear mate. Seems quite unreasonable
"Try and understand how you learn. A lot of intuition in technical fields, not just in mathematics, is understanding the material in a way that you understand it.<p>For me it was trying to frame as much as possible in a geometric lens. Draw pictures of anything and everything as much as possible. Graphs, number lines, 3d animations, whatever it takes.<p>Also, understand the &quot;bold print&quot; from the &quot;fine print&quot;. I mean to say, every theorem will make a general statement, and then have a bunch of conditions where it holds. So worry first about the bold print, then try to understand the fine print.<p>Much of mathematics is about making the strongest and most general statements in bold print with as little fine print as possible. Basically the less fine print you have, the more important probably your result is."

"The single consistent thing I have noticed in dealing with this type of anxiety is that if I spend time with people I actually like being with, it completely disappears. It&#x27;s impossible to be so self-directed if there is another person in the room who I care about or love.<p>To that end, the fix is simple: surround myself with people that I love. Friends and family.<p>Easier said then done, especially in our modern world, which is why I suspect this comes up frequently."

On the other hand, doing this 24&#x2F;7? That&#x27;s just not right and I think this runs afoul network neutrality legis... oh, wait."
"I&#x27;m not a fan of Roswell or Portacle, personally, because I&#x27;m used to taking control of my setup. I try to stick with well-maintained distribution systems (e.g. Debian&#x27;s .deb or the source itself if need be) otherwise upgrades tend to be complex, not well documented, and supported by few people. Additionally, as one new to Common Lisp, it is difficult to understand the abstraction layer at which Roswell &amp; Portacle operate with respect to abstraction layers implicit to Common Lisp.<p>I better understood these layers by installing SBCL myself and playing with Quicklisp (a package manager) and ASDF (a package definition library). I wrote about this a year ago [0]. It was confusing at first. But it became clearer after exploring and writing that post. Ultimately I don&#x27;t find it very different than writing a Python library with setuptools.<p>re: SLIME; I never ended up remembering the keyboard shortcuts as a CL hobbyist so I turned it off after a few uses and stuck with vanilla Lisp-mode. Parenthesis completion and auto-ident are the only two tools I expect of my text editor (vs. in a GUI, buttons take the place of keyboard shortcuts you must remember). I use Emacs at work and home but I hardly remember any extension shortcuts (as much as I want to benefit from projectile and magit). It even took me a few years before I felt comfortable using package-install vs. just `git clone`-ing new modes and adding their paths to my .emacs.<p>For all these reasons, Portacle as a distribution isn&#x27;t really my style. Roswell didn&#x27;t solve anything for me either once I got familiar with ASDF and Quicklisp.<p>Complacency on tool UX doesn&#x27;t help a community. Roswell &amp; Portacle may be a forward iteration on UX. But I also want to share the fundamentals (or at least N-1 layer down) and get other hobbyists comfortable there too.<p>[0] <a href=""http:&#x2F;&#x2F;notes.eatonphil.com&#x2F;starting-a-minimal-common-lisp-project.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;notes.eatonphil.com&#x2F;starting-a-minimal-common-lisp-pr...</a>"

"In some Latin countries, road names are given after &quot;important&quot; people (for a vague definition of important). On the cultural side, having a standard for naming like this removes that and I think it could be a roadblock for adoption. Politicians&#x27; names are specially used for naming roads&#x2F;squares and they are always after promoting their names in every new opportunity.<p>On the other side, I really like that the code can be shortened with the addition of a location. One concern I have is that most people are very local, they exchange addresses for local places all the time... so easily speaking those addresses is nice thing. A short code helps with that.<p>And finally, I may have missed it but I didn&#x27;t see landmark references mentioned. Could it be that people would have to say &quot;I live at XZY123 in New York.

"There is already quite the discussion going on related to macOS versus [insert linux distro here], but here are my two cents. I&#x27;ve been quite happy with my 2015 MBP since I took the time to &quot;gut&quot; most of the default shell tools and replace them with newer ones. It&#x27;s not a convenient process, but from my experience, it&#x27;s really not that much harder than setting up a fresh Arch install. It&#x27;s as close as I&#x27;ve been able to get in terms of having the &quot;hackability&quot; and freedom of working in a Linux environment, while still having the pleasant UX that comes with macOS (good DE, decent memory management, lovely touchpad, etc.)."

I wonder how many people arguing for the abolishment of the EC would like it if India and China automatically had the most votes in whatever supranational government arises in the future and got to decide everything that happened across the world.

Far from earth this can be done approximately with simple orbital mechanics, but close to earth you need to account for athmospheric drag and also the uneven or &quot;bumpy&quot; gravitational field.

"I read the article and tried to read the linked study (paywall). But I see no mention of the &#x27;random&#x27; part of this outside the introductory paragraph. In order for the headline to be true, wouldn&#x27;t the study have had do asses some performance of &#x27;random&#x27; picks?<p>Rather it seems that people were encouraged to take more &#x27;risky&#x27; stock picks, and <i>that</i> led to some improved success, not anything to do with random.<p>I think the title and introduction are wrong, having extrapolated incorrectly from the study itself. I don&#x27;t really know since I can&#x27;t read the study.<p>But I think I strongly disagree with the premise. I think picking stocks at random is likely to lead to uninterested investors who may lose interest in frequent contributions to their stock accounts as they have no personal connection or awareness or interest in the location or use of their funds.<p>Yes, diversification is important, but so is awareness.

Does this mean that political authorities (or major tech companies) <i>can</i> get their roots in the program, as long as there&#x27;s no direct evidence they&#x27;re using it to MITM? Seems like you&#x27;d want the opposite policy, where to get your root in the program, you have to sign a bunch of agreements about how you&#x27;re going to use it and submit to regular audits to make sure you&#x27;re not misusing your new authority.<p>Maybe I&#x27;m reading too much into this though."
"I remember when CVE-2009-1897 was current, because it is an obvious example where no one would expect the null check to work:<p><pre><code>    struct sock *sk = tun-&gt;sk;

    if (!tun)
</code></pre>
Obviously &quot;sk&quot; is not used until after the null check, but if we read it line by line as we would expect a naive compiler with no optimization to act, the pointer is followed before the null check, and null should produce a crashing program. It would seem that anyone expecting it to work would <i>assume the evaluation of the initial assignment of sk to be lazy at first use</i>, which is a very strange assumption.<p>Still, I remember in 2009 people writing about that snippet as if it is a surprising result and the compiler did something wrong."
I think this is pretty good.<p>As a pretty senior dev myself I always tell people to have an actual design in mind.

"Any state that relies on the AI as the primary grader does not understand the current state of AI.<p>It would make sense to use the AI as a first pass, and then not <i>randomly</i> grade the essays with a human, but specifically choose all the essays that are on the cusp of the pass fail line.

"Amazon&#x27;s transformation in Canada has been remarkable. Back in 2011 or so, the selection for anything was extremely sparse, like the shelves in a Soviet-era store. Today, the  shelves are full, but with third party sellers selling used products as new, and the search results jammed with no-name Chinese brands with thousands of 5-star reviews.<p>I bought a Blackberry Key 2 LE on Amazon.ca, advertised as a Canadian model and brand new. When it arrived, the box clearly labeled it as a refurbished product to be sold in India only. Thankfully they still offer a no-questions asked return policy , but maybe that&#x27;s limited to Prime members. Once my student subscription expires, I&#x27;ll be off Amazon forever. Just not worth the hassle."

If the latter, I may have to try this a few more times."

"I think taxing packaging along with a country-wide standard for recycling AND for standardised containers (as per other posts here) would be the best option - win-win for governments. Non-homogeneous packaging eg. Cardboard food containers with plastic windows would be taxed heavily.<p>Taxing packaging by weight and type would theoretically work to minimise packaging and encourage eg. Bringing a tupperware container to the shops. The standardised (countrywide) container types would mean you could eg. Put your standard coffebean container under the supermarket dispenser and do away with packaging.<p>The taxation would apply to manufacturers (import) not consumers, thus incentivising them to advertise green credentials as a feature, and to cut down packaging or pass the cost on (at which point most customers would move to the cheaper product).<p>As far as non-homogeneous packaging goes, if it takes longer than 5sec to separate each bit into homogeneous parts, then I&#x27;d class it as non-homogeneous."

"&gt;I think they just overestimated the ability of their employees to respect each other when they hold differing world views.<p>I think this can be quite difficult to do just because of the political views involved.  For example, how should a gay man respect a colleague who honestly thinks that homosexuality should be punished with death.  In such a case, I would say that even asking the first individual to tolerate, much less respect, the second is itself a form of disrespect.<p>Now, that is a pretty extreme view for today&#x27;s society but good for making an example with.  It is also not too far off from many views that I have personally seen, especially when you begin to imagine the legal changes involved to implement those views."

"I&#x27;ve sort of wondered if recycling plastics is actually maybe bad from a CO2 angle.<p>It seems that using mined virgin oil for plastics that gets tossed in a landfill means that at least a little more of the oil we are mining ends up not getting burned and emitted as CO2. In this way, we&#x27;re creating non-global warming demand for oil which competes with the energy demand in the market. I don&#x27;t know if this is a reasonable way of thinking about it.<p>Of course, the energy required to haul a bottle of water hundreds of miles is huge, so I&#x27;m not arguing for buying more plastic waste, just not sure how recycling existing plastic waste affects global warming in particular."

"Skimming through the docs, even though warts of postal addressing are mentioned, this seems like a (base-14?) encoding of geocodes rather than unified hierarchical postal addressing (which is still an accomplishment, and something I can see a need for). Though this seems to work for latin scripts only I guess.<p>For actually representing global postal addressing schemes with all warts and historic practices, I know no better standard than UPU S-1. I had a project for (partially) implementing it for a large logistics provider ten years ago. It was one of the few cases where using XML for business data genuinely made sense, as addresses could be represented in a line-oriented format (as you&#x27;d write on a postal piece) and at the same time structured info in the address (postcodes, streets, house numbering tokens) could be tagged for extraction, validation, etc. Though to make end-of-line chars significant in XML (which we had to somehow because postcodes are often placed at the begin or end of a line in formal addresses) we had to represent addresses basically as address_line_1, adress_line_2, etc. SGML could&#x27;ve handled this much more elegantly, as not only can it assign meaning to line breaks via short references, it also (theoretically) allows representation of overlapping (concurrent) tagging structures for two or more vocabularies."

"Mom cried.<p>She used to be a librarian. Then she was a geographer. The old school kind, the one that actually drew actual maps. The librarian skills really came in handy when drawing real maps. Everything <i>had</i> to be right. People could get lost in the wilderness and be using your map, or countries could be drawing international borders based on your map, war could break out over your mistakes. The printers and early dot-matrix printers put her whole department out of business though. That was fine, my siblings and I came along about then anyway.<p>I was too young to remember, but I think it was Encarta 95. I remember standing there next to Mom as she fired up the new program, my sister sat on her lap. She wasn&#x27;t very tech savy, still isn&#x27;t. We helped her out a bit with the mouse and clicking into everything.<p>We looked up East Germany first thing. Mom wanted to make sure Encarta was correct, right, true. We knew East Germany wasn&#x27;t a thing anymore, even though a lot of the maps in school and in our children&#x27;s books were saying it still was a thing. It took a while back then for things to percolate. Mom wanted to make sure this thing was as up to date as possible.<p>She typed it in, it took us to an index page, Mom clicked on the top listing (I think). We read a bit about East Germany. It had an end date. Mom was happy. This resource will do for her family. Then there was a bit of text that was underlined. Mom hovered over the underlined text. It said to click on the underlined text to go to that page. My sister squirmed a bit.<p>Mom clicked and then the internet came crashing into our house like an asteroid or an artillery shell or an earthquake; the floor was left behind. <i>Everything</i> changed in an instant.<p>It took us, automatically, to the linked page. I think I was about unified Germany. But it did it instantly. Boom, there you were. Reading.<p>Mom cried.<p>It was at that moment that Mom understood. No more card catalogs. No more having to hunt the shelves. No more having to look in the index for the page numbers, jamming your fingers in the back while you flipped through the tome. No more walking and sitting back down. No more having to ask strangers to watch your bags while you went diving into the stacks. No more checked out books you were looking for.<p>Just. Click. And. Read.<p>I asked her what was wrong. My sister was not happy with Mom crying. Mom was a bit flabberghasted. She told me about all the effort that went into just getting the information, all the time you lost, all the excitment that drained. And how that was no more. How it was so easy to read and to learn, now. The world was going to be so good for her children, for me, for my sister and my other siblings.<p>Mom cried in joy."

"Looking into this only briefly, it didn&#x27;t take long to find a lot of very questionable decisions made by Brave:<p>1. They&#x27;re positioning themselves as both an advertiser and a privacy advocate[1], which strikes me as more of a strategy for bootstrapping revenue than a trustworthy moral position. The <i>entire point</i> of crypto micropayments is to pay for content with crypto rather than attention&#x2F;privacy. Why should I view Brave&#x27;s ads rather than the other ads on the internet from advertisers who also claim their ads respect privacy? The fact that Brave has decided to get into bed with advertisers at all shows they&#x27;re committed to profit, not to users: micropayments are just a way to diversify for Brave, which will quickly fall to the wayside if it fails to provide the revenue they want.<p>2. The entire concept of a Brave Verified Publisher stinks. It positions Brave as a censor. If this system takes off, then suddenly Brave has control over who gets paid for content on the internet, and can censor content they don&#x27;t like. And this isn&#x27;t hypothetical, <i>they plan to do this</i>: their TOS[2] explicitly contains a code of conduct which contains a long list of things they will terminate your account for: they <i>promise</i> to use their power as censors to enforce of US copyright&#x2F;patent law and also a wide variety of subjective social norms. This also shows their commitment to being an advertiser rather than an application that serves users: if you&#x27;re serving users then you let them pay for the content they want to pay for, but if you&#x27;re serving advertisers, then you can&#x27;t let advertisers brands be seen as supporting questionable content.<p>3. BAT based in Ethereum seems to be basically a way to ride the wave of cryptocurrency hype while still positioning themselves as a central authority&#x2F;middleman. If they weren&#x27;t trying to position themselves as a middleman, they would just make the micropayments in Ether directly, or better yet, in a cryptocurrency that doesn&#x27;t have a history of forking the blockchain to fix an bug in a major users&#x27; contract[3]. If they weren&#x27;t trying to ride cryptocurrency hype, they&#x27;d just allow micropayments via a much-simpler-and-more-reliable REST API or similar since they&#x27;re already the central authority anyway.<p>I don&#x27;t think we can trust Brave with our privacy or attention. I don&#x27;t think we can trust Brave with the decision of who gets paid for content. I don&#x27;t think we need Brave as a middleman to pay content publishers. I don&#x27;t like the state of how content is paid for on the internet, but I don&#x27;t think Brave is the solution.<p>It&#x27;s disappointing to me that Wikipedia has decided to associate their name with Brave&#x27;s. A big part of why I respect Wikipedia is their long-standing policy of keeping independent from advertisers, and it seems naive of them to have not realized that <i>Brave is an advertiser</i>. I can understand why Wikipedia has made this decision, but I still think it is a compromise of Wikipedia&#x27;s values, and I hope they&#x27;ll reverse their decision in the future.<p>[1] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;brave.com&#x2F;brave-ads-waitlist&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;brave.com&#x2F;brave-ads-waitlist&#x2F;</a><p>[2] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;brave.com&#x2F;terms-of-use&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;brave.com&#x2F;terms-of-use&#x2F;</a><p>[3] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.coindesk.com&#x2F;ethereum-executes-blockchain-hard-fork-return-dao-investor-funds"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.coindesk.com&#x2F;ethereum-executes-blockchain-hard-f...</a>"

"Seems like society is constantly pushing to remove all the ways in which kids used to live. Can&#x27;t just wonder around and play on the sidewalks or the streets anymore with your friends, someone will call the police on you. Can&#x27;t hang out in the woods, as those have mostly been torn down to make way for new neighborhoods, and the woods that do remain are typically private property. Unless you are lucky enough to live in a place that still has a good wooded area where there&#x27;s no busy bodies, you are out of luck. Can&#x27;t hang out at the mall, they will kick you out if you aren&#x27;t accompanied by an adult. Can&#x27;t hang out at your favorite local joints anymore, they&#x27;ll kick you out. I was also among the last generations that really got to experience freedom and a playful world as a child, I can&#x27;t imagine growing up in the world today.<p>The biggest problem are people who can&#x27;t mind their business and people who have been conditioned to fear the world. The 24&#x2F;7 fear cycle of news has drilled it into so many peoples minds that if you see someone anywhere on your street outside, they are there to murder, rob, mutilate, or otherwise commit crime."
"Engineer &#x2F; engineering manager here.<p>Nicely articulated article. There is one observation that I respectfully disagree with - the one that says interviews are monotonous and boring.<p>I have done hundreds of interviews in my career and never found them to be boring. Perhaps one the reasons is I don&#x27;t do scripted interviews. It is always an exploration for me. I will start with simple questions and if I get good answers I will go deeper and deeper into the subject matter or into the adjacent area. If I don&#x27;t get good answers I will retract and probe another direction. This is sort of a depth-first traversal of candidate&#x27;s skills with a heuristic to stop traversing a particular branch if I see it is not a promising direction.<p>My goal is to discover the area where the candidate is the strongest (obviously within the areas I am interested in for the particular role I am hiring for). It is very fun and almost never boring. The experience is always different because people are never the same. Yes, some candidates are just not good, but even bad ones are bad in different ways.<p>I know common wisdom for using scripts is to have repeatable and comparable evaluations so that you can choose the best candidate. I understand the desire but I prefer to find the best in each candidate and if it means I have to use a lot of gut feeling and intuition to make the final decision then so be it, I believe it still results in better overall results. The idea to choose the person I want to hire based on how many answers to my standard questionnaire they got right was never appealing to me.<p>I can totally see how if you do scripted interviews it can become boring, so don&#x27;t. Interviews can be fun and it can be a creative process.<p>Another way interviews can be fun is if you find someone who has stronger skills than you do in a particular area. I love it when a candidate teaches me something new. Find where their strength is and let them shine."
"Unpopular quote from my image and video processing professor - “The only problem with machine learning is that the machine does the learning and you don’t.”<p>While I understand that is missing a lot of nuance, it has stuck with me over the past few years as I feel like I am missing out on the cool machine learning work going on out there.<p>There is a ton of learning about calculus, probability, and statistics when doing machine learning, but I can’t shake the fact that at the end of the day, the output is basically a black box. As you start toying with AI you realize that the only way to learn from your architecture and results is by tuning parameters and trial and error.<p>Of course there are many applications that only AI can solve, which is all good and well, but I’m curious to hear from some heavy machine learning practitioners - what is exciting to you about your work?<p>This is a serious inquiry because I want to know if it’s worth exploring again. In the past university AI classes I took, I just got bored writing tiny programs that leveraged AI libraries to classify images, do some simple predictions etc."
"It&#x27;s wise to look a gift horse in the mouth when it comes from an amoral corporation, but I suspect this is fairly honest, not because Uber is doing it out of the kindness of their own hearts, but because Uber wants to avoid regulation.<p>People who claim that regulation only makes things worse should take note of this: even the <i>threat</i> of regulation can be enough to get corporations to at least try to appear to do the right thing.<p>That said, I think there are two problems with this:<p>1. Long-term results of this will just be Uber trying to avoid regulation for as long as possible, while figuring out more and more clever ways to maximize profit at the expense of both drivers and passengers.<p>2. Any payment agreement which doesn&#x27;t include health insurance in the US needs to be considered as significantly reduced. Back of napkin math ahead: Health insurance can run as high as $700&#x2F;month and after taxes someone getting paid $21&#x2F;hour takes home closer to $10.50, meaning some drivers will have to work ~65 hours&#x2F;month just to pay for health insurance. Assuming Uber drivers drive 160 hours&#x2F;month (which is conservative), paying for their own health insurance is a ~40% reduction in pay. This means that, pre-tax, that $21&#x2F;hour looks a lot more like $12.60&#x2F;hour would in a country with a reasonable healthcare system. Of course, there are some worst-case scenario numbers included here (most people&#x27;s health insurance <i>isn&#x27;t</i> that expensive) but at least some Uber drivers, particularly with expensive-to-treat preexisting conditions, are going to be receiving a <i>much</i> lower wage if health insurance isn&#x27;t included. I suspect this singlehandedly is why Uber is even making the $21&#x2F;hour offer: as a way to avoid regulation that would require them to pay for health insurance."
"Spoilers:<p>&gt; Literally every single paper was either p-hacked, overfit, or a subsample of favourable data was selected (I guess ultimately they&#x27;re all the same thing but still) OR a few may have had a smidge of Alpha but as soon as you add transaction costs it all disappears.<p>&gt;  I should caveat that I was a profitable trader at multiple Tier-1 US banks so I can say with confidence that I made a decent attempt of building whatever the author was trying to get at."

"&gt;Next we shall take a moment to remember the fallen heros, without whom we would not be where we are today. I am, of course, referring to the RNNs - Recurrent Neural Networks, a concept that became almost synonymous with NLP in the deep learning field.<p>XLNet (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;1906.08237"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;1906.08237</a>) is in essence a recurrent neural network, using a transformer (which is based on neural networks) which recurrently keeps context between different batches. But the gated RNN&#x27;s, such as AWD-LSTM&#x2F;GRU, are fading out to the superior transformer architectures, this is true.<p>That&#x27;s my only complain though, excellent theoretical introduction.<p>Although, if anyone wanted to actually implement a transformer, be ware that you want to have a 8+ GB GPU unit available, or be prepared to use cloud computing (Google Colab is free, for now). Training neural networks is quite hardware dependent still."

"This seems a little underwhelming to me, it took several paragraphs and generic graphs to say: Senior developers are more independent, have more authority and influence, and work more on architectural problems.<p>I agree? Those are definitely necessary areas to master, but someone can achieve that without really being senior.<p>What I think makes someone actual senior is how they deal with failure. Anyone can show up and handle a task when they know how to do it and execute it correctly. When things go wrong is when seniority is important. Someone who has failed and watched others fail, seen servers go down, fixed critical bugs in production, made terrible estimates, over promised and underdelivered will have the thick skin you need. Failing and watching others fail is invaluable experience and cannot be taught in schools&#x2F;bootcamps. Approaching failures unemotionally, moving immediately to what the next steps need to be is a big part of what makes someone senior to me."
"I have a custom printf that logs to a ringbuffer in MRAM, which is sort of like battery backed SRAM that doesn&#x27;t need a battery."
"That sounds nice. But while using U2F&#x2F;FIDO for a few years (with two HyperFIDOs, one for &quot;daily&quot; use attached to my key-chain, the other as a backup in a safe), I found the most common problem was that websites&#x2F;services don&#x27;t tread these keys as first class citizens. For example GitHub: I have my two keys setup there, but I can&#x27;t opt-out of SMS authentication.<p>If I knew I could use my keys at more services, I would already have upgrade the daily driver to a NFC variant (so I could use it with my phone).<p>So, to any webdevs on HN reading this: Take that shit serious and implement 2FA ;-)<p>&#x2F;&#x2F;edit: GitHub is just a single example; and it&#x27;s possible to opt-out of SMS, if a authenticator app is used instead. That&#x27;s what I mean by second class citizen: Security Key(s) + X is possible, but while X alone can be configured, Security Key(s) alone is(&#x2F;are) not allowed."

"I am working with reducing the time teachers spend on exams and assessments. I have access to a cleaned and manually scored dataset of 550k essays that is exponentially growing. Looked at creating at a model based on this dataset to automatically score essays with NLP parameters such as grammar, structure, spelling, word complexity, sentiment, relative text length etc.<p>The problem that I encountered was actually how to apply it in a useful way, since the problems mentioned in the article are quite obvious when you design the model.<p>Options that I saw:<p>1. Use it as autonomous grading with optional review by the teacher, see the linked article for the problems with this.<p>2. Use it as a sanity check on the teachers manual scoring, but it would not reduce the work load and probably just undermine the teacher.<p>Do you have any suggestions for how such a model could be applied in a practical and ethical way?<p>Had some thoughts on how to measure actual knowledge about a subject, but that would require a massive knowledge graph which would introduce a huge amount of complexity just to see if it would be a feasible approach."
"1) Log to local disk (most people will tell you this is bad practice and that you should directly log to socket or whatever, but it&#x27;s more likely for your network to be down than for your disk to fail).<p>In Python, use the RotatingFileHandler to avoid running out of space.<p>2) Incrementally forward your log files to a server using something like fluentd that can pre-aggregate and&#x2F;or filter  messages.<p>Big advantage of logging to disk: if logging server is unreachable, forwarder can resume once it&#x27;s up again. If you log directly over network, if things fail the very log messages you need to troubleshoot the failure are potentially gone.<p>3) Visualize. Create alerts.<p>I&#x27;ve evaluated a bunch of logging solutions. Splunk is the best, and affordable at low data volumes (they have a pricing calculator, you can check for yourself). It&#x27;s medium hard to setup.<p>Sumo Logic is the easiest to set up, and at low data volumes, prices are similar to Splunk. You can get something working within an hour or less.<p>ELK stack is free only in bits but not in engineering time.<p>I&#x27;ve not actually tried Sentry.io but I saw it at PyCon and it looks pretty impressive.

You are lying to your audience. It is beyond me that all this hoo haa about aesthetics, &quot;highlighting differences&quot; and other qualitative bullshit takes precedence over objective truthful representation of data.

My phone is always on silent and I don&#x27;t pick up any calls except if its from my started contacts or if it&#x27;s a pre-scheduled meeting.

"As more powerful AI computation capabilities become available to hobbyists, I hope someone takes up researching new board games similar to Go, Chess and the other giants of abstract strategy games (ASG).<p>Basically, train really strong AI players using the AlphaZero method with the rules of the game changed by a human author (either some variant of Go, or a completely new game). Then take a look at the games the AI plays at its strongest level and let people decide if the game looks interesting enough for them to try play competitively. With the strong AI player already in place, human players would have something to learn from and a serious competitive culture could be born.<p>In the absence of something like this, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s surprising the only popular ASGs are very, very old.

"I applaud Mozilla and Google for this.<p>It does get me wondering however, how viable this would be in other countries. Say, what if the UK or the US were to try to pull something like this. There&#x27;s not much that Kazakhstan can do against Mozilla. However, if something similar were tried here in the US, it seems to me Mozilla would be a lot more vulnerable to government retaliation, or being forced to do what the Fed says whether they want to or not. The Mozilla Foundation is incorporated here in the US. Those board members whom are not US citizens could be deported or prevented from entering the US. Those board members whom are US citizens and residing here could be arrested. The IRS could be weaponized to revoke their 501(c)3 status.

We need only to look at the history of other nations abroad and our own history here to see just how quickly and easily it can and has gotten that bad in the past.<p>Again, I&#x27;m glad of Mozilla&#x27;s and Google&#x27;s technical solution to this problem. But, as it seems governments continue to lean in this direction, I worry that failing to pursue the policy angle in addition to the technical angle when addressing these problems will cause the technical solutions to be or become brittle.<p>Edit: I was reminded that donations to groups who <i>do</i> pursue the policy angle, like the EFF, would be more effective than handwringing on HN.

"Definitely going to be following this, as it&#x27;s something I&#x27;ve thought of doing for my &quot;next&quot; phone - for basically all the reasons you&#x27;ve stated.<p>I&#x27;m sick and tired of not being in total control of my current phone.<p>I&#x27;ve thought about rooting it, but even if I did (it&#x27;s a Samsung S7 from T-Mobile - which has a different processor and other stuff than the S7 that is easily rootable - and there are other &quot;games&quot; Samsung and probably T-Mobile play cat-n-mouse with the guys figuring out ways to root - which means a new update, etc - ugh all around ultimately), there&#x27;s still the whole Google Store thing, walled gardens, etc.<p>Then there&#x27;s the crap that happens with apps you like; I had this great file manager app that I loved, that also had numerous other tools - had used it for years, paid for the &quot;ad-free&quot; version, etc. Then one day, via HN or something, I don&#x27;t recall exactly, someone noted that the app (and the company behind it) had been sold, and that the new version was doing dirty things behind the scenes, introducing bloatware and who knows what else - and people were abandoning it left and right. I recoiled - did some more research - and that night took it off my phone; I paid something like $15.00 for it - not a huge amount of money, but still - money lost. I ended up getting a different file manager, which is ok, but nothing like what I had - paid for the ad-free version - but who knows if the same thing will happen down the line?<p>Then there&#x27;s the whole &quot;file management&quot;, copying, sharing, etc angle - the whole BS about how in Android, if an app didn&#x27;t create a directory, you can&#x27;t put files in it (this apparently is conditional in some fashion - but it isn&#x27;t very clear). This makes moving and managing files very difficult at times. Or the whole &quot;let&#x27;s not let users treat the device as a USB block device to copy&#x2F;move&#x2F;delete files from - and instead put in place another crappy layer that prevents all that - for some hand-wavy reason that didn&#x27;t seem to be a problem when I first got my G1&quot;...<p>There are other things, too - but you get the picture. I&#x27;m tired of it. Totally. My next phone will (hopefully) be one that I build, will run Linux, and will be under my complete control. I&#x27;m kinda hoping that by the time I get around to it, that there&#x27;ll be an equivalent to the RasPi 4 in the Zero W&#x27;s footprint. Add on a few other modules (IMU+GPS and 4G mainly) - and you have everything for a full phone. I might even not implement voice call features, as virtually everything I do tends to be texting-based anyway.<p>Don&#x27;t want a keyboard, either - if I can get a decent capacitive touchscreen that&#x27;ll connect to the Pi, I&#x27;ll be fine; if I need a keyboard, bluetooth will work. Which also means I could use it as a &quot;portable desktop&quot; - all the convenience of a handheld, with the ability to become something more like a laptop on the occasion I need it (plus, if I need a big monitor, plugging that in would be easy too).<p>It&#x27;s nice to see someone else blazing this trail - one that other&#x27;s have gone down too (I know of other projects like this - some Arduino based, which is another route I have considered - but using an ESP32 as the core). You&#x27;ve already made a ton of progress, but I look forward to your future efforts. Good luck with it!"

"&quot;The National Hurricane Center says cones will contain the path of the storm center only 60 to 70 percent of the time&quot;<p>Sounds like the communications fix is easy.

"Not quite the same issue, but this reminds me of my very first job, back in 2001, where we used a homebrew C++ framework that separated lots of concerns, and then used a single massive .h file with 10,000 const uints to tie everything together.<p>Compiling took over 2 hours. The header was generated automatically, but after I added a macro that replaced those const uints with #defines, compile time dropped to 30 minutes, which was quickly voted the biggest productivity enhancement in that project.<p>More relevant to the topic, in javascript programming I recently switched to using const instead of let wherever possible. Most variables don&#x27;t actually vary, so let&#x27;s make that explicit. That can prevent some unexpected surprises (though not all, as objects and arrays in constants are not immutable)."

By not using this feature this becomes indistinguishable from any other database backend...<p>There&#x27;s also a major limitation without using Batched transactions.

Not defending people who self-cite but here is an alternative explanation. There are many areas of science that have very few researchers working on the same or related problems. In addition papers tend to build on prior works of the same or related researchers. Over time we may see clusters of what look like &quot;self-cited&quot; papers. This is not abnormal.

"I can only recommend TimescaleDB. It solves the right problems (storing timeseries) while not creating new ones (deployment, backup, hot failover) as it relies on Postgres to provide the underlying infrastructure. I stored 100 million sensor samples in TimeScale and had not issues with scaling on medium sized boxes, despite issuing complex time-series queries.<p>As for the hosting option, currently sadly AWS doesn’t offer Timescale as part of RDS. There are two options: Azure offers Timescale now as part of their hosted Postgres.

"The problem is that dependent types (and the very idea of &quot;correctness by construction&quot;) suffer from fundamental, serious limitations -- both in theory and in practice -- that the author does not seem to be aware of. He also does not seem to be aware of all the <i>other</i> approaches for software verification and correctness (sound static analysis, model checking, concolic testing) that have so far shown greater promise, and formal methods research focuses on them rather than on dependent types (the approach that scales least and suffers from the most limitations); in fact, last I spoke with a dependent type researchers, he told me that now they&#x27;re trying to <i>weaken</i> the soundness of their type systems (sort of gradual-dependent-types) to try and fight the problems types suffer from. I&#x27;m not saying dependent types don&#x27;t have some uses, or that they won&#x27;t change enough so they could play a central role in software correctness, but thinking that they&#x27;re the future of software correctness (in their current form) shows a complete lack of familiarity with this field."

"This might be throwing a lit match into a gasoline refinery, but why not opt for XML in some circumstances?<p>Between its strong schema and wsdl support for internet standards like soap web services, XML covers a lot of ground that Json encoding doesn&#x27;t necessarily have without add-ons.<p>I say this knowing this is an unfashionable opinion and XML has its own weaknesses, but in the spirit of using web standards and LoC approved &quot;archivable formats&quot;, IMO there is still a place for XML in many serialization strategies around the computing landscape.<p>Json is perfect for serializing between client and server operations or in progressive web apps running in JavaScript. It is quite serviceable in other places as well such as microservice REST APIs, but in other areas of the landscape like middleware, database record excerpts, desktop settings, data transfer files, Json is not much better or sometimes even slightly worse than XML."

"Low friction and no support ejection from app markets seems to be a necessary cost of the low-cost, low-friction entry that they allow, and the fact that action against app developers to recover costs due to abuses isn&#x27;t easy. If we had more upfront costs (both directly to market operators and in surety bond) it would be practical to have a lot friendlier process in the event of apparent violation. But then, we&#x27;d have a lot fewer devs even able to get into app stores, and the vast majority of non-abusive developers would experience this as a pure burden. The few that get caught up incorrectly in policy violation scans would benefit (assuming they weren&#x27;t kept off the market in the first place), and it would be more abstractly fair, but I&#x27;m not sure it would be a win for consumers <i>or</i> developers on the whole<p>Which isn&#x27;t to say it shouldn&#x27;t be done: fairness is important, too.

"Excellent article, well grounded in the reality of software development. New developers and managers would benefit from understanding the practical points made here as early as possible.<p>I do think perhaps there is too much emphasis on reuse and particularly cloud services. Ironically, this is partly for the reasons given elsewhere in the article. If you rely on outsourcing important things, you also naturally outsource the deep understanding of those important things, which can leave you vulnerable to problems you didn&#x27;t anticipate. Also, any integration is a source of technical debt, so dependencies on external resources can be more fragile than they appear, and if something you rely on changes or even disappears then that is a new kind of potentially very serious problem that you didn&#x27;t have to deal with before. Obviously I&#x27;m not advocating building every last thing in-house in every case, but deciding when to build in-house and when to bring something in can be more difficult than the article here might suggest."

Facebook, Google, maybe an outsider will come up with the best client that has all the features and added goodies (magic emojis, special video effects, something new etc).<p>- People wanting to get on the networks will never google the protocol just like people who want to get an email client do not google &quot;imap&quot;. They just google the most popular client such as gmail.<p>- Overtime, the most popular client will get a quasi-monopoly and will become incompatible with the rest of clients, no one will notice except for us nerds on HN.<p>- This already happened with xmpp (facebook messenger, google hangouts and others used to be on xmpp).<p>Now you might say, &quot;but how about email&quot;? Well, first of all, email is an oligopoly and it&#x27;s practically impossible for individuals to set up their own servers and expect their emails to get delivered all of the time. So I wouldn&#x27;t call email such a great success story. Another thing is that email is work oriented and so it makes sense to keep compatibility between businesses. Email also arrived very early and had time to spread slowly at the beginning of the internet among various small to big players, which explains why no company could take over it.<p>For all these reasons, I do not believe in a magical protocol that would save us from big tech. The protocol in itself would not be enough. A non-profit would need to be in charge of the most popular client such as Mozilla with Firefox, but even then this  did not turned out as expected although Chromium is open source so yay."
"Still seems like YT&#x27;s version of &quot;Fair Use&quot; is significantly more constrained than the legal definition.<p>This is a step in the right direction, but YT&#x27;s system is extra-judicial in nature, and they&#x27;ve decided to be more copyright holder friendly than the law itself requires (likely so the law isn&#x27;t used, which is cheaper for YT).<p>I suspect in my lifetime governments will need to create better frameworks for content networks. The whole &quot;they&#x27;re a private company, they can do anything!&quot; argument is growing weaker by the day as these companies have more influence in our lives (with both good (e.g. anti-hate content) and bad (e.g. copyright holders stepping on small creators) consequences)."

Nobody else in the competition was even close. 3rd place was something like 2m 10 cm.<p>I&#x27;ve never been so disappointed with 2nd place. Just goes to show, not matter how confident and able you are, you can still fail. Yes, the world kept turning, and the sun still came up in the morning.

"The only time you can really provide mentoring is if the person wants it and asks for it. It is not yet enough because the person may say they want it but have wrong impression of what it entails (like having expectation of some kind of magical step change in their life), but it is prerequisite IMO.<p>So, obviously, this answer is wrong beacuse that would mean that there cannot be any mentoring.<p>Another observation of mine is what is mentoring for. A person that isn&#x27;t interested in learning something will not learn it no matter if the do or don&#x27;t have a mentor. A person that wants to learn something will also learn it regardless of whether they have mentor.<p>The role of mentor is to expedite the process, help avoid dead ends or bad habits and generally make the end result better and faster than without mentor.<p>I can learn to be Enterprise Architect or play flute on my own, but having a mentor makes it easier for me.<p>I pay for a flautist to teach me but really I don&#x27;t want him to teach me. I teach flute myself and the flautist is to point out errors, tips that help me learn it faster, his experience of how he learned it, all to let me reach goals that I set with less effort.<p>The problem people have is the moment they get a &quot;teacher&quot; they assume some kind of shared responsibility or even expectation that the student will somehow offload part of the effort onto the &quot;teacher&quot;.

"This might not be ideal, but I just don’t bother engaging with people where there are deep fundamental differences in terms of basic values or worldview, especially when it’s obvious they’re not interested in hearing anything contrary. My goal isn’t to convince anyone, it’s to find people with whom I already have some shared basis of understanding and reach a point where we can at least understand each other’s perspective.<p>If I’m truly confident that somebody else is deeply and fundamentally wrong, like creationists or Holocaust deniers or whatever, I don’t take responsibility for their misconceptions and I don’t think I have anything to learn from that person so I just ignore them. Convincing such a person that they are wrong conveys zero benefit to me and is not something that the other person even wants me to do for them. I guess a more positive way of phrasing that is that, when I pick arguments, I do so just as much to give the other person a chance to convince me. If there’s no chance of that happening, it’s not worth my time."

He isn&#x27;t trying to break new ground, but I&#x27;m glad his writings exist. To pick a very random example, here&#x27;s CQRS defined in an approachable manner[1]. It&#x27;s a great link to send to a team of 50, out of which quite a few will be fresh out of college. And I am pretty sure Martin Folwer has seen plenty of real world code while he was working at Thoughtworks. The ideas in his writings aren&#x27;t conceived in some vaccuum.<p>Some of his early writing isn&#x27;t perhaps as relevant today. For instance, he talks about the flaws of Anemic Domain Model here [2]. Back in the day, many of us tried to enrich the domain model with particular emphasis on reusability. But those things are less relevant in today&#x27;s heterogeous environments where logic lives across in multiple services

"React DevTools are very valuable.<p>But only because React, with transpiling and the shadow DOM and all that is so inscrutable.<p>There’s no hope of understanding the DOM with React, no hope of understanding styles with styled-components.

Maybe just a few hundred dollars a year less, that type of thing.&quot;<p>The key metric would be, how many people <i>act</i> on this impulse. How many Americans are actually switching to lower paid jobs that are more meaningful? And are actually meaningful, that is, and where that is a choice: not being forced to switch to a lower-paying job and then rationalizing it afterward as being more meaningful.<p>I suspect plenty of people would also take a <i>less</i> meaningful job for more pay. What could be less meaningful then getting money for doing nothing? Yet, that&#x27;s what a lot of people want, such as anyone who buys a lottery ticket."

"Even though the post is just a book advertisement, the topic of trying to unravel ancient mysteries is an interesting one.

"I like the article, it gets to the point. I would, however, change this: &quot; 3. Hire the best engineers you can.&quot; to: &quot;3. Hire and work hard to keep the best managers and engineers you can.&quot; As they mention, accumulating knowledge is important. Keeping that knowledge around is therefore also important (and sometimes difficult). The best managers will know what technical debt is, how to handle pressure from higher-ups, and how to keep a team happy, healthy and productive."

Yes, it does require 100% buy in, and it will probably happen in Asia and Europe before the USA, but a fleet of self driving vehicles can theoretically coordinate in ways people can’t (not to mention the standard lack of parking needed for taxi-like personal transportation).<p>But then would people just live even further out, given that even drive time is now free?"

"This was such an interesting article!<p>The only nitpick item I&#x27;d mention: isn&#x27;t kind of crappy that the U.S. gov. gave the Union Pacific railroad pretty much a monopoly of that 200-foot right of way piece of land?  I mean, i could understand if the railroad used it for their own uses, which from a functional perspective, i understand and agree...But for this railroad to turn around and authorize others - and I&#x27;m sure they charge everyone for this! - to then use that land, just seems sort of unfair.  I understand that it&#x27;s &quot;convenient&quot; for other entities to only work with that single entity; but that still seems a monopoly to me.  So, forevermore, the Union Pacific railroad will get money for use of this land, that they were given so many years ago; well, that sucks."

"&gt; Utah has been using AI as the primary scorer on its standardized tests for several years. “It was a major cost to our state to hand score, in addition to very time consuming,” said Cydnee Carter, the state’s assessment development coordinator. The automated process also allowed the state to give immediate feedback to students and teachers, she said.<p>Yes, education takes time and costs money. Yes, not educating is both cheaper and faster. Note how the rationalizing ignores the needs of the students and the quality of the education.<p>I live in Utah and my children have been subjected to this automated essay scoring here. One night I came home from work and my son and wife were both in tears, frustrated with each other and frustrated with the essay scoring which refused to give a high enough score to meet what the teacher said was required, no matter how good the essay was. My wife wrote versions herself from scratch and couldn’t get the required score. When I got involved, I did the same with the same results.<p>Turns out the instructions said the essay would be scored on verbal efficiency; getting the point across clearly with the fewest words. I started playing around and realized that the more words I added, the higher the score, whether they were relevant or grammatical or not. Random unrelated sentences pasted in the middle would increase the score. We found a letter of petition online for banning automated scoring for the purposes of grades or student evaluation of any kind. It was very long, so it got a perfect score. I encouraged my son to submit it, and he did. Later I visited his teacher to explain and to urge her to not use automated scoring. She listened and then told me about how much time it saves and how fast students get feedback. :&#x2F;"

"I had Encarta &#x27;97 as an 11yo, purchased at a Malaysian street vendor market for probably all of 3 bucks. It felt incredible to have that much knowledge available for almost no money. And it wasn&#x27;t just boring text like the paper versions, there were videos too!<p>There was  point in time where that truly felt like the future. Considering that we&#x27;re now in the age of autoplaying, monetized &quot;content&quot; video nearly everywhere you go, it was nice to have only &quot;primary source&quot; video, aka stuff like the moon landing, or the MLK speech, instead of some nobody warbling on about its importance while splicing in stills of said video because they don&#x27;t want to be in violation of the copyright.<p>The concept of finite, structured and bounded content is also extremely powerful in this era of overwhelming data, much of which rehashed and warmed over by various publications not to mention utterly infested with ads.<p>The concept of spending hours down a Wikipedia rabbit hole is not new, and it&#x27;s one of the reasons I donate annually. But it first started with Encarta, and it&#x27;s offline-only format has grown to be only more valuable as time goes on."

"I&#x27;ve been hearing about the return of Zeppelins since the 1980s. Still hasn&#x27;t happened.<p>&gt; But for all their high-tech advances, Hunt said, the new airships would still get their buoyancy from hydrogen, a highly flammable gas that is 14 times lighter than air. It’s the same gas the Hindenburg and the other big zeppelins used in the 1930s.<p>As a reminder, the Hindenburg was originally designed for helium. They were unable to get the US to lift its ban on the export of helium under the Helium Control Act of 1927.<p>&gt; As an additional bonus, Hunt said, the fuel cell would generate as a byproduct water that could be released as the craft passed over regions hit by drought.<p>That&#x27;s isn&#x27;t much amount of water, and certainly not enough to affect a drought.<p>Figuring 2km long x 200m x 200m that&#x27;s about 3E9 mol of gas.

"I think I was 7 when I first got hold of it. It was installed on my Dad&#x27;s work laptop and since using it, I would beg him every week to leave his laptop at home. Among my memories was spending time going over the virtual tours. Encarta had this feature that allowed you to take either a 360 tour, or a full immersive 3D virtual tour of a historical building. I remember my favourites being the Abu Simbel and Persepolis tours. Another feature I miss were the interactive quizzes (only available on Encarta Kids) and that creepy trivia game. One of my past times as a kid was going home from school and studying for these quizzes, reading dozens upon dozens of Encarta articles then later trying my luck on beating my high score. A couple years later, we finally got internet connection and the hobby died down. While the internet provided a wider library of knowledge, it never gave me a platform to cultivate and test my interest for devouring trivias as much as Encarta."
"I have often thought that part of the rationale for the electoral college was that in the 18th century they did not have the internet, TV, Radio, even newspapers were pretty scarce. So it just wasn&#x27;t all that practical for a candidate to ride a horse around all 13 colonies to meet each voter. The logical solution would have been to have a parliamentary system whereby the congress would select the president for you. The problem there was that the president would be beholden to the congress and you would lose some of the checks and balance features because he would be less likely to veto something.  So they developed a &quot;shadow congress&quot; that did not have law making responsibilities but sole purpose was to travel to Philadelphia or DC and hear the speeches and so forth and select the president for you as your representative.<p>Looking at it from this 18th century perspective highlights why it is completely unnecessary today. Obviously the voter has many ways of getting to know the positions of the candidates themselves and hence able to elect the president directly. There is no need for it today."

"Sites don&#x27;t offer RSS because<p>- they are developed by hipsters who were in elementary school when RSS was in its heyday and don&#x27;t know what it is.<p>- sites operators want to human users to interact with their site specifically, and not be able to skim the highlights through a remote interface.

"&gt; Today we are happy to introduce Turbo, a new colormap that has the desirable properties of Jet while also addressing some of its shortcomings, such as false detail, banding and color blindness ambiguity.<p>What are the desirable properties of Jet? Why not use Viridis or Magma or any of the recent linear colormaps from matplotlib 2.0? These shortcomings were the exact reason why Viridis was created as exemplified in this brilliant talk: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=xAoljeRJ3lU"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=xAoljeRJ3lU</a><p>I don&#x27;t understand the point of Turbo.<p>&gt; Turbo mimics the lightness profile of Jet, going from low to high back down to low, without banding. As such, its lightness slope is generally double that of Viridis, allowing subtle changes to be more easily seen. This is a valuable feature, since it greatly enhances detail when color can be used to disambiguate the low and high ends.<p>Why would anyone want low-to-high-to-low colormap?<p>&gt; Viridis is a linear color map that is generally recommended when false color is needed because it is pleasant to the eye and it fixes most issues with Jet. Inferno has the same linear properties of Viridis, but is higher contrast, making it better for picking out detail. However, some feel that it can be harsh on the eyes. While this isn’t a concern for publishing, it does affect people’s choice when they must spend extended periods examining visualizations.<p>Personal taste vs scientific accuracy - I will take the latter unless we are doing plots for marketing materials. In my view this is not substantiated reason for going off and creating a more pleasant version of Jet; Turbo is still <i>inaccurate</i> and <i>deceiving</i>.<p>This is a deplorable attempt at creating a new colormap where the problem statement isn&#x27;t clear in the first place."
"Tridactyl is a wonderful piece of software. My problem is the assumption that it’s unacceptable for an extension (which has a native messenger) to have the capability to modify Firefox when <i>explicitly told to by the user</i>. I use tridactyl, and plenty of people do, but realistically, the entire audience of an extension that gives you vim keys is highly technical, and can be expected to read the docs. Making the software edit personal files on disk when <i>not asked to explicitly by the user</i> is a breach of my trust model. It’s not as though fixamo is run on startup, it’s something you have to do explicitly. I’ve never run it, nor do I use the native messenger.

"The relationship between the architect of a building and its general contractor is no different than it is in software: acrimony, with each thinking the other is wrong on most fronts. General contractors believe their experience gives them superior insight into how something should be built, and that architects make impossible-to-implement plans. Architects take great care to make precise decisions on hundreds of dimensions, ranging from cost engineering to air quality, aesthetics in the context of then, now, and the life of the built environment, and scoff when plans aren&#x27;t followed. Somehow, usually, through a lot of bickering and change orders, things turn out alright.<p>The architect absorbs vast information and designs a solution, the builder makes it into reality, often making meaningful and lasting decisions during implementation. Both are competent and valuable. Sure there are design-build people and teams, sometimes they work very well. Architects will always have more context in the realm of ideas, that is the space they occupy. Builders have the most context in implementation, and may detect issues that make the whole plan invalid. Collaboration helps. Mistrust doesn&#x27;t.<p>Architects don&#x27;t have to swing a hammer to know where the planks should go, but boy it sure does help if they have."

"Javascript engines gave up on interpreters too quickly. JITs have been a huge source of security holes, and the language is so huge now that verifying the correctness of JS optimizations is extremely hard.

Web pages have just grown to contain so much Javascript that they&#x27;re even slower than they were when JS was slow.<p>Browser vendors should agree to make JS slow and safe again like it used to be, forcing web developers to make their pages smaller and better for users.

- founders having experience working in enterprises (neither good nor bad, but it slowed the process down a lot)<p>My favourite gems that they discovered... in the Australian startup community, it appears that investors are no better at picking successes than random chance. Externally-funded companies had no difference in outcome compared to bootstrapped ones; the only difference is that they got to success or failure faster."

"My experience has been similar. I upgraded from the 2014 MBP (which is a glorious machine) to 2018. The day I got it, I realized it had issues with the keyboard (several keys repeating). Took it back to the store, got a new device. The issue wasn&#x27;t as widely acknowledged back then. When I complained to the store that I was experiencing the same issue again, the gave me yet another device, same issue. Went back to the store and they got annoyed at me. They complained that none of their other customers reported this issue.<p>They accused me of installing apps that were causing this issue although I had nothing of that sort installed. I am a web developer and like to think that I know computers well enough to not install sketchy apps. I had installed all the same apps that were in my 2014 MBP so when I confronted the store, they just gave me a random reason and sent me away. I got so fed up trying to convince these people that there was an issue. I ended up buying a Magic Keyboard and using that instead.<p>Mind you, all this happened in India where Apple doesn&#x27;t have a direct retail experience. 3rd party retailers have zero training procedures in place. Their staff isn&#x27;t nearly as knowledgeable as their US counterparts about the products they are selling. This whole keyboard fiasco has been my worst Apple experience."
"My productivity hack is coming to terms with the fact that my life can&#x27;t, and will likely never, be as optimised as the processes and routines that I like to optimize for work.<p>There is something about the oppressive guilt of being &quot;unproductive&quot; that, for myself personally, far outweighs any of the benefits gained from being hyper-productive.<p>Although I do feel a certain &quot;high&quot; when coming off of a full 8 hours of get-$#&amp;+-done mode. I try to realize that isn&#x27;t a switch that is flipped. It&#x27;s just a derivative of my current state of mind."
"At the risk of being slightly tangential, I&#x27;ve been sorely wanting to air this particular grievance with Rust for some time. It&#x27;s somewhat related, since the author mentions their package system. Its package ecosystem isn&#x27;t nearly in the horrible state that node&#x27;s is, but having a package system shouldn&#x27;t be a substitute for designing a useful standard library for a language. I think that the attraction to &#x27;small languages&#x27; is very much misplaced. If I can&#x27;t get through Rust&#x27;s official documentation without being recommended the use of third party packages for basic functionality (getopt, interfacing with static libraries... Etc) then the designers have made a terrible error."

"I see a couple different aspects here:<p>1. <i>Targeting Kids.</i> I don&#x27;t see the targeting. Marketing a product as &quot;cool&quot;[1] is a valid tactic for the, say, 18–35 age demographic, too. Is there a way to market to 18-year-olds <i>while actively dis-marketing to 17-year-olds</i>? Serious question.<p>Anecdotally, the radio ads I hear for Juul are all testimonials from middle-aged smokers who switched. Which is not to say that they don&#x27;t have other tactics, but this particular one can&#x27;t be particularly attractive to teens.<p>2. <i>Deceptive Marketing</i>. Probably more legit, but not limited to tobacco. No marketing is going to tell you why <i>not</i> to use their product. Now, alcohol, nicotine, gambling, high fat&#x2F;sugar foods, credit card debt, etc. should be held to a higher standard than, say, Forever 21.<p>[1] I.e., &quot;social media posts glamorizing vaping&quot;, &quot;flavors including mango, mint and creme brulee&quot;, &quot;depicting the devices and those who use them as cool and sexy&quot;. Or from a sub-linked article, &quot;mak[ing] it look cool and sleek&quot;."
I don&#x27;t like this article.<p>1. Fails to mention that the reason why many people block ads is because publishers sue overly aggressive ads or ads that advertise harmful content (scams). Publishers who use these practices <i>should</i> be losing money.<p>2. Pretends that if cookies are used then companies will stop trying to fingerprint.<p>3. Sounds like they are trying to prevent blocking cookies entirely- I&#x27;m not sure how that is giving more power to the users.

" This isn’t anything new. In my 90s middle school and high school, the official policy of my school was that we would have an hour of homework per academic class each day.  We got out of school at 3:30.

I’m confused about how they ever thought that was healthy or reasonable."

Then others started adding more lines, more aggressive colors, and now you have npm ads painting a half a screenful of empty lines with their ad in the middle. Once can imagine an arms race of ever worse ads.<p>And considering that it’s not unusual to be installing <i>hundreds</i> of npm packages for a single project, the ads would soon render the logging output unusable, giving rise to an arms race between npm ads and npm ad-blockers.<p>So npm basically had to nip this in the bud, before it makes the ecosystem unusable through the tragedy of the commons."

"Personal anecdote;<p>I remember taking a standardized test, can&#x27;t remember if it was SAT or CSAT (Colorado pre-SAT test). This was at a time when I&#x27;m confident that humans were the graders.<p>I started with an intro that would be appropriate for a standard 5 paragraph essay; i.e. the thing you write when you don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re talking about and you&#x27;re just following a format.<p>In the third paragraph I took a leaf from family guy, and just interjected &quot;WAFFLES, NICE CRISPY WAFFLES, WITH LOTS OF SYRUP.&quot; for the next page and a half, I berated the very foundation of the essay prompt, insulting it the way only an angst ridden early teen can.<p>... I got a 98% on the essay.<p>Fast forward several years. I write an essay for for an introductory college course final. My paper is returned to me with a coffee stain and a &quot;94% - good work!&quot; note scribbled on the top. That note was scribbled by a TA that would turn out to be my girlfriend for 2 years. One night in bed, she tilts her laptop to me, showing an article that I used as the central theme to the above essay; &quot;can you believe this?&quot;<p>&quot;Are you joking? Of course I can believe this, it was the subject of the essay you gave me an A on 2 years ago&quot;<p>She admits she didn&#x27;t read past the first paragraph of anything she grades, and just bases grades on intuition based on how articulate the essays are at the outset.<p>...<p>The point I&#x27;m making:<p>Does AI suck at judging the amount of informative content in a student essay?

The problem of black hole “information loss” really has nothing to do with just exactly what you mean by information.

"This is one of the most concise tutorials on how generators, coroutines and futures&#x2F;promises are related (from first principles) that I&#x27;ve seen.<p>I&#x27;m hopeful that eventually promises and async&#x2F;await fade into history as a fad that turned out to be too unwieldy. I think that lightweight processes with no shared memory, connected by streams (the Erlang&#x2F;Elixer, Go and Actor model) are the way to go. The advantage to using async&#x2F;await seems to be to avoid the dynamic stack allocation of coroutines, which can probably be optimized away anyway. So I don&#x27;t see a strong enough advantage in moving from blocking to nonblocking code. Or to rephrase, I don&#x27;t see the advantage in moving from deterministic to nondeterministic code. I know that all of the edge cases in a promise chain can be handled, but I have yet to see it done well in deployed code. Which makes me think that it&#x27;s probably untenable for the mainstream.<p>So I&#x27;d vote to add generators to the Rust spec in order to make coroutines possible, before I&#x27;d add futures&#x2F;promises and async&#x2F;await. But maybe they are all equivalent, so if we have one, we can make all of them, not sure."

"I&#x27;ve always been amazed at how important it appears to be to lie about selling crap. I find that invariably, businesses who compete on price make it iff they <i>say</i> it&#x27;s good stuff, even if everybody knows it isn&#x27;t.<p>Eg Holland has a number of cheap shoe chains. Schoenenreus and Scapino both breathe an air of cheapness, and one went bust and the other is struggling bad. Their direct competitor Van Haren sells exactly equally crappy shoes, and everybody knows it, but they are thriving, simply because the store feels like a proper high quality shoe store.<p>Or take ALDI, which competes on price and nothing else. In every country I visited has the words &quot;the ALDI principle: low prices, high quality&quot; printed on every storefront and on every <i>page</i> of their paper promo flyers. Granted, little of what they sell is &quot;total crap&quot;, but little is of truly high quality either. Their bread goes stale faster and their coffee is bitter. This surprises nobody.<p>It appears to me that this weird dichotomy is the only way to successfully compete on price. Make it perfectly obvious that you&#x27;re cheap and of mediocre quality at best, while loudly shouting that the quality is high. Nobody believes you, but nobody wants to buy from you if you&#x27;re honest about what you&#x27;re selling.<p>I find this surprising because blatant lies don&#x27;t generally work that well in the long term, so why do they here? I generally <i>hate</i> dishonest messaging. Why don&#x27;t I mind here? I buy ALDI and Van Haren all the time."

The problem with social networks is that they incentive all discourse.

Here is the acquisition pitch deck that Tesla put out at the time of acquisition: <a href=""http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.solarwakeup.com&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2016&#x2F;10&#x2F;Tesla-SolarCity-Investor-Presentation.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.solarwakeup.com&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2016&#x2F;10&#x2F;Tesla-...</a><p>Unsurprisingly, the author of the article doesn&#x27;t address any of the primary points contained in this pitch deck."
"To be honest, this really doesn&#x27;t feel like it needs to be a news story of this magnitude.

"Cloud NAT would be fine except it costs 4.5¢ per GB (in both directions) which could hurt some use cases. If your backend VMs pull in more than 64.8 GB per month from the Internet it&#x27;s cheaper to just pay for the public IP. (Only applies to outbound connections initiated by the VM, inbound connections through load balancers don&#x27;t go through the NAT.)<p>I&#x27;ll echo what others have said - it sucks that they&#x27;re doing this before adding IPv6 support. A good portion of traffic could bypass the NAT entirely considering how many services support IPv6 these days.<p>They don&#x27;t start charging until April, so maybe they&#x27;ll surprise us with an IPv6 announcement before then, but I&#x27;m not betting on it. :("
"Fracking is the primary reason a bunch of *nuclear power plants in the USA are shutting down early. The over-supply of gas from fracking, plus the inherent simplicity and efficiency of gas turbines makes them crazy hard to compete with. The carbon-free nuclear plants weren&#x27;t overly expensive to operate, but when the electricity revenue dropped (especially in deregulated markets), they started struggling mightily.<p>Nukes produce 60% of the carbon-free energy in the USA. As they shut down, they&#x27;re often replaced with natural gas, which locks in carbon emissions and indirect emissions from pipelines and the wellheads.<p>It&#x27;s on the nuclear people to figure out how to get operating costs safely down. But boy howdy it&#x27;d be nice if their carbon-free nature could be valued higher, or if fracking could be made more expensive.<p>This is also a big part of why coal is struggling, but this doesn&#x27;t bother me because coal is high carbon and high in killer air pollution (especially outside the US.

"Little Big Adventure is painted down in the article, but it is also a masterpiece. It plays uniquely, in a way that&#x27;s hard to express.<p>I happened to find a copy in a discount bin almost a decade after it was released. Despite the dated graphics, the charm of the game feels absolutely tangible throughout the game. I completed the game and did so again after another 5 years through dosbox. I bought the sequel (LBA2) because of this, of which I have mixed feelings.<p>The controls of Alone and LBA always felt natural to me, so I cannot share this sentiment of confusion. The sudden camera jumps in Alone in the Dark can be confusing, but then again I actually played &quot;Resident Evil&quot; <i>before</i> Alone (it was only then that I became interested in the genre).<p>I have to say that there are several french games that really stood out to me due to the artistic and general playstyle in general.<p>&quot;Heart of Darkness&quot;, from Chahi of Another world fame stays true to his style. The &quot;Gobliins&quot; series from Coktel vision are similar to lucasart&#x27;s games, but have a completely different humor&#x2F;feel to them. Coktel Vision did several positively weird games (Inca 2, for example).<p>I played most of these games decades after they were made just for curiosity, simply going by the &quot;I liked this game, let&#x27;s see what the author&#x2F;s also did&quot;. Sometimes you do really hop into masterpieces that stand the test of time.<p>If you have youtube channels that dig into this sort of stuff, I&#x27;d love to hear about it. I follow some retro channels, but I didn&#x27;t see those really mentioned anywhere aside from the usual &quot;Another World&quot; and &quot;Price of Persia&quot;."
"I do like the idea of weaving database functionality into the OS, but I also have concerns.  Oracle has, on a few occasions, taken to extending their database technology to areas like this and the result was obtuse and perverse.  I am thinking of a large system I worked on forged in early Oracle Forms and Reports.  Each form (window) would have trigger procedures stored in the package that represented it, and you were left with the kludged-in features of PL&#x2F;SQL for basic things like looping and control flow.  SQL was never intended to define software.  And attempting to take it and mutate it in that direction is starting from a false premise I think.  Sure, with anything that is Turing Complete you can build anything.  But that doesn&#x27;t mean you should.<p>If that danger is avoided, the broad concept itself might have merit, most especially in replacing the way we deal with filesystems which should have changed decades ago.  I believe that storage should be separated into mutable and immutable categories.  Immutable data (software packages and the like) should be managed by a universal networked content-addressable versioned immutable data store.  Something like Perkeep mixed with the Internet.  If you did something like &#x27;apt-get install firefox&#x27;, it would lookup the current versions GUID from a DNS-esque service and check the local store, then the local network store, and then hit the Internet store of data if necessary to pull down the content.  It could be thought of like extending storage from registers, L1 cache, L2 cache, L3 cache, main memory, disk outward to the network, with data traversing each level only when necessary as a kind of overgrown cache control.  Very storage-constrained contexts could purge anything immutable with confidence that it would be able to pull it back in when necessary.  Call it &#x27;swap to the cloud&#x27; if you&#x27;re a marketer who doesn&#x27;t realize how horrific that sounds to technical folks.<p>Mutable storage would be handled as a local database, it would be all of your personal content and similar, stored and indexed with ways that are efficient for data which can change rapidly and which must be preserved as it may be the only copy.  Individual disks should, ideally, be presented to the user as a unified whole with reliability information baked in and managed by the OS in the background.  Whether and which data is replicated, striped, etc should just be something people set with their hardware providing maximums (if you have 3 drives, you can choose 300% reliability as its max and based on the drive reliability, age, SMART status, etc, the system will rebalance what is stored where in order to best preserve the users desires, only bothering the user when things cross a certain threshold of uncertainty).  Data is important.  Not just for corporations, but for everyone.<p>Software Transactional Memory should be built into the hardware level and supported at the OS level, and can be supported at the OS level before hardware has a chance to catch up and accelerate it.<p>The OS should present itself sort of like Smalltalk &quot;images&quot; operate to the user, albeit with most of the moving pieces covered by a thin veil unless you launch a &#x27;system edit&#x27; sort of mode which would make the running objects editable and present live development tools.  Code editors should not simply be text editors, but tools which know they are operating on code and treat it as such, allowing one to operate on an AST or syntax tree view for certain operations.<p>Vector graphics and the concept of graphics &#x27;surfaces&#x27; rather than a simple framebuffer should be the &#x27;step 0&#x27; of supporting moving to a more modern system.  Take advantage of modern pixel densities on high-resolution screens."

"They are misunderstanding why RISC-V and Raspberry Pi are popular: it&#x27;s not so much that they&#x27;re freeware but that they are cheap.

What makes a processor popular are cheap, affordable systems people can easily acquire in an online shop at prices which compete with or are below contemporary P.

A recent example is Pixar’s film Finding Dory, which featured a blue tang fish (Paracanthurus hepatus) as the main character and was widely reported in the popular press to have increased the number of such fish in the pet trade. We use Bayesian posterior predictive counterfactual models to evaluate the movie’s effect on three metrics of societal behaviour. Although there was an increase in global online searches for the blue tang 2–3 weeks after the movie, we find no substantial evidence for an increase in imports of blue tang fish into the US, or in number of visitors to US aquaria compared to counterfactual expectations. It is vital that an evidence-based discourse is used when communicating potential impacts of popular culture on human-wildlife relationships to avoid loss of credibility and misdirection of conservation resources."

After a week I went to the doctor and Lyme came back negative. Another week passed and he gave me an antibiotic and it cleared up in a few days. It may have been psychosomatic but I have never experienced anything like it before or since. The mark on my ankle has taken almost three years to heal."
The big deal here is the patent grant. FAT related patents were held over linux like a gun in the Ballmer years. Its a reason Linux was stuck with 8.3 length filenames for so long.

"I agree the system described is crazy. However, I find it frequently useful to use ordered JSON as a data format and I think it would be handy if more languages supported it. For one, it makes it a lot easier to write integration tests using a “golden file” of ideal output, because your program that outputs JSON now usually deterministically has one correct output. For two, it lets you hash a json-encoded object deterministically."

This link was gray for me because I recently used Levenshtein distance to sort an arbitrary list of strings by finding a &quot;comparison word&quot; that gave the ordering that I wanted. Definitely more of a cutesy (and difficult to explain) way of doing things rather than practical but Case statements are so boring. It was nice that Presto had it built in.<p>Did some more digging to see if there was a unique comparison word that would enable me to sort any group of strings but found that it was impossible. Still a fun afternoon of learning.

I ended up sending an &quot;update&quot; with some random changes on things related to said policy (without actually changing functionality) and it somehow got approved.<p>If you think about it, it&#x27;s impossible to fully check an app for compliance.

"The OpenAI approach to managing the release of the larger dataset strikes me as totally flawed and upside down. The biggest concern the team seem to have is that the fully trained GPT2 model will be used to spread propaganda and misinformation. They also imply that the biggest hurdle to training a similar model is money needed to pay for the training resources.<p>The problem with this approach is that the users most likely to be malicious users of GPT2 are state actors. China, for example, <i>already</i> spends millions on an immense propaganda factory. Money is not a serious obstacle for a state. Given that other research entities are, by the sound of things, already far along with development of similar models it seems unlikely that China and the US don&#x27;t already have functional models internally.<p>On the other hand, legitimate business and research is clearly hamstrung by withholding the full model. What we have is the maximum degree of inconvenience and the minimum degree of security. It feels almost perfectly analogous to ban on liquids in airports. The motivation for that ban was that existing security measures couldn&#x27;t detect liquids, but simply announcing a ban was to be enforced didn&#x27;t change the fact that liquids were undetectable. Instead millions of travelers were pointlessly inconvenienced at great cost.<p>Release the kraken already!"

"I&#x27;ve been meditating for the last 2 years, and I&#x27;ve found many benefits.  Stress reduction, better control of feelings, better understanding of self, and joy are just a few.<p>It&#x27;s really simple to start out:<p>1) Devote 10 minutes of each day to meditation time.  Early morning is best, as your mind is fresh and not as distracted.<p>2) Find a quiet&#x2F;non-distracting place to sit in a comfortable position.  Legs crossed on the floor or in a chair are fine.  You want to keep your back straight to help keep from falling asleep.<p>3) Focus on the sensation of your breath, wherever it is strongest.

Looking at the games, the look of the tiles won’t affect gameplay (as I tight if, for example, the programs do a flood-fill of the map at some time) so it shouldn’t be hard to, at startup, check for the presence of a ‘tiles.png’ or ‘tiles.bmp’ file, and read tiles from it, if present."

You need a source of trust in these systems. Journals used to have that role. They had high standards that were upheld by editors selecting only worthy publications. Today it seems that many journals aren&#x27;t as trustworthy as they seemed to be in the past. It&#x27;s also easier to spam the journals with your publication and to bullshit your way into publication. The incentives to publish a lot are also way higher now that your grant money is highly dependent on your citation count. Journals can publish more and easier and lower the standards for submission to earn more money. The system is basically eating itself and we haven&#x27;t found a cure yet.<p>Filtering for self-citations is useful to identify the bubbles. But it is not sufficient to determine if those bubbles only contain hot air or if these scientists are actually working on something with substance in a narrow field where few others publish.

"The observation seems logical, but I wonder what is actually the relevance of the study in practice.<p>I mean, there are three common situations where these dogs are used:<p>1) airports, stations, traffic stops etc. where the influence of the trainer might be relevant (i.e. the trainer, even if involuntarily, may influence the dog if the person that is sniffed - or their belongings&#x2F;looks&#x2F;behaviours&#x2F;etc. - look suspicuous to the trainer)<p>2) search in buildings for drugs or explosives<p>3) screening of mail, packages, containers, etc.<p>I believe that among these only in activity #1 the trainer might have some pre-constituted suspect that would &quot;trigger&quot; the influence on the dog.<p>But in any case the dogs are only used as a means of &quot;triage&quot; of sorts, so at the most this influence leading to false positives will cause some time wasted.<p>Still in case #1 (and possibly in case #3) the issue might be that if there are too many of these false positives, while the attention of the trainers&#x2F;policemen is drawn to the &quot;false target&quot; some other one (actually carrying drugs or explosives) will &quot;go through&quot;."

"I had to renew my Asus home laptop last June running Windows&#x2F;Linux. I hesitated between a Linux or MacOS MacBookPro but I finally decided to buy a Dell XPS 13 9380. It costed me 1500Euros (i7 8cores&#x2F;16Gb&#x2F;512GbNvme&#x2F;1080p&#x2F;Thunderbolt3&#x2F;IntelGpu920). The MacbookPro with a better screen but inferior keyboard costed 2500Euros...
We&#x27;ll see how long the Dell will last. I am bit worried about the battery.<p>Since then I run Arch with Gnome3&#x2F;Wayland and everything just works including bluetooth&#x2F;suspend&#x2F;usbc dock&#x2F;etc... except the following:
- the fingerprint scanner, there are no Linux driver (even for the Ubuntu version sold by Dell)
- Wayland fractional scaling does not really work, everything is blurry, so I don&#x27;t use it. When my I am disconnected from the external monitor I just type a command to do text scaling...
- Battery life is still inferior compared to Windows, especially when I watch youtube videos (I don&#x27;t use Firefox on Linux because of the lack of hardware acceleration)<p>Compared to MacOSX I find Linux better for development and Ops. All the tools just work, are up-to-date and can be installed from the command line (pacman with the user repositories &gt; brew&#x2F;cask).
For amateur video editing&#x2F;photo editing, you now have plenty of choice (especially for video).
Of course Gnome3 is inferior in term of performance, stability and is less visually appealing.<p>The OS is a commodity nowadays. Well more and more. Many applications can be found for the 3 major OS. 
That is why more and more OS vendors offer cloud services like backup&#x2F;security&#x2F;planning tied to the OS, well integrated and not opened.<p>Also more and more Microsoft&#x2F;Apple&#x2F;Google will integrate AI related services tied to your usage and what they know of you, so Linux will not be able to compete in that area."

"I&#x27;m not 100% sure, but I think this might be the first thing I&#x27;ve seen on HN front page, in all my time on this site, that actually motivated me to jump right into criticism. Usually I just stay quiet if I don&#x27;t have anything positive to say.<p>First of all, before even clicking through, my reaction to the name was negative. To quote henrikberggren&#x27;s comment: &quot;Naming a learning platform &#x27;Sugar&#x27; is like naming a rehab clinic &#x27;Heroin&#x27;.&quot;<p>Second, those stick figures look like skull-and-crossbones.<p>Third, your sample &quot;fun activity&quot; looks less fun than anything a kid with a computer has access to.<p>Fourth, creating a new user in your Sugarizer demo is an awful experience. It asked me to pick a name first, then let me go through the rest of the steps -- including &quot;choosing&quot; a new avatar color by clicking to get random colors until I just gave up -- and then, at the end, told me the user &quot;foo&quot; already exists.<p>Fifth, I don&#x27;t find the UI intuitive at all. When I&#x27;m inside an activity, if I want to go back to the activity selection page, I have to click on an octagon with a square inside it. No idea how I&#x27;m supposed to associate that with &quot;home&quot; or &quot;back&quot; or any of the verbs I could think of.<p>Lastly, I tried out a few of the activities and I have no idea how any of that is supposed to help kids learn or collaborate. The &quot;clock&quot; activity just displays a clock. That&#x27;s it. The &quot;tam tam&quot; activity has a confusing UI, but once you overcome the confusion, you can just pick different instruments to hear their sound. The most confusing was the &quot;maze&quot; activity, because I pressed one arrow key and it solved the whole maze. Later I realized that it follows the path until a decision point and then waits for input, but it&#x27;s really weird.<p>I appreciate that this must have taken substantial effort, but I have no idea just how this is supposed to be useful. And let&#x27;s face it, I gave it more time than an average visitor probably would."

The project was later rewritten entirely in C because of performance problems due to the way Go interoperates with C: Go considers a function call into C that lasts more than ~20 microseconds as a blocking system call, in that case it will put the goroutine running that C call in waiting queue and resuming it will effectively cause a context switch, degrading performance (since there were a lot of them happening). See also this issue in the Go bug tracker.<p>The added benefit of the rewrite in C is that it&#x27;s now easy to embed dqlite into project written in effectively any language, since all major languages have provisions to create C bindings."

"A couple of thoughts, in the spirit of this essay:<p>There&#x27;s different levels of consumption. If it&#x27;s a decent book, someone, usually a few someones, have revised and rewritten parts of a thought, in an attempt to refine the thought, boil it down, expand on it, etc. Your average Kanye tweet probably is, at best, a shot from the hip, blindfolded.<p>Creation doesn&#x27;t have to be a linear process.

"As a first step, browsers should make extensions more powerful again. It&#x27;s a pain that extensions are so teethless these days.<p>Then we could make a powersaving extension. It would allow a page a cumulative number of ms to use the CPU&#x2F;GPU and a max number of network requests. After that it would display &quot;This page has exceeded its quota of resources. Should all JS be halted? You can always continue the JS by clicking the  little PowerSaver icon&quot;.<p>Here is a fun way to tame power intensive tabs (tried it with Firefox and Chromium and it works for both):<p><pre><code>    top
</code></pre>
Look at the ID of the most busy tab. Let&#x27;s say it&#x27;s 1234<p><pre><code>    kill -STOP 1234
</code></pre>
Boom! Immediately the tab is frozen and it&#x27;s CPU usage drops to zero.<p><pre><code>    kill -CONT 1234
</code></pre>
Now it is alive again.<p>To pause all tabs:<p><pre><code>    pkill --signal STOP firefox
</code></pre>
And to continue:<p><pre><code>    pkill --signal CONT firefox
</code></pre>
For Chromium, just use &quot;chromium&quot; instead of &quot;firefox&quot;.<p>So if we had something like native extensions, we could achieve a &quot;pause button&quot; by simply leveraging the STOP and CONT signal of the OS. If one were to look deeper into how browsers do their work, I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if we could target the signals more precisely and keep scrolling alive during the pause. Or we could CONT the process in case of a scroll event and then immediately STOP it again.<p>Another approach could be a &quot;BrowserTamer&quot; application that keeps the browser STOPped as long as there is no mouse&#x2F;keyboard activity and CONT it for 100ms on scroll&#x2F;keyboard activity. That could probably be implemented as a seperate program without help from the browsers themselfes."
"&gt; Avoid network polling to obtain periodic updates from a server. Use WebSockets or Fetch with a persistent connection, instead of polling.<p>Oh the irony.

The FOSS version of low-latency HTTP streaming is based on chunked-transfer encoding via a...persistent fetch connection. Despite chunked-transfer low-latency steaming being widely deployed in production for the past few years (Twitch, Periscope use this), they didn’t think it was the right solution. I wonder what the WebKit team thinks of this."

"I&#x27;m wondering how this is going to effect the hobbyist and small business electronics markets here in the United States?<p>Know how cheap and easy it is to get a small number PCBs made in China and shipped to the US? That&#x27;s over.<p>So is any number of small electronic parts that would&#x27;ve been shipped free or cheaply from China. Cheap ESP8266 boards? Nope. Cheap automotive relays? Nope. Basically any and every kind of piece of electronics components, modules, etc you can think of will jump in price drastically.<p>Even if it doesn&#x27;t need to - it will (like I&#x27;ve seen on the tariffs, prices jumped for small amounts of electronic components just because, even if they were being shipped directly to the end-user consumer - when that&#x27;s not a part of the tariffs - direct to consumer sales shouldn&#x27;t be affected, but because the vendors could do it, they did it anyhow - just to make some extra cash).<p>So where are hobbyists and others supposed to get these parts now?<p>Digikey and Mouser for some of it. Surplus for others. But for boards and modules and such - well, there&#x27;s just Sparkfun and Adafruit - maybe a couple of others (not sure?).<p>But they are likely to raise their prices too, because they depend on the components (resistors, diodes, mosfets, chips, aka the &quot;raw materials&quot;) to make their boards (Sparkfun makes them in-house - or at least some of them - but I don&#x27;t know what Adafruit does).<p>Or we&#x27;ll have to pay the extra shipping fees and other costs (because the chinese sellers will just add on some extra cost - just to grab it - it&#x27;s inevitable).<p>This will have a ripple effect; small entrepreneurs and startups - kickstarter startups especially - won&#x27;t be able to compete, unless they base themselves in Shenzhen - because where are they going to get the components cheaper than a competitor who is already there? They aren&#x27;t made in America any longer (and they never will be again - get that fantasy out of your head if you think that&#x27;s going to happen).<p>Radio Row is gone. The original &quot;silicon valley&quot; is gone. Heck, there used to be a ton of computer (mini) manufacturers and businesses here in Phoenix - they are virtually gone, too.<p>And now with this change - however you feel about it - is going to hobble the next up-and-comers, and current suppliers. At least, that&#x27;s how I am seeing it.<p>Now I&#x27;ll admit - it wasn&#x27;t fair for competition here - but it wasn&#x27;t as if China was doing something wrong, as far as I understand it. They were playing by the rules set forth by an international body. Maybe it wasn&#x27;t fair to us. But instead of letting this kind of thing go on for 1-2 decades, it should have been fixed back then. Now it is likely to destroy or severely change at least one or more areas of enthusiast and hobbyist things (think also RC, drones, etc), as well as probably a ton of other non-electronic things. Do we really think there are that many suppliers here in the US that will charge low prices (competitive with Chinese suppliers) and have fair shipping rates to boot?<p>The fact is, it will likely still be cheaper to ship it from China, even with the extra cost on shipping - since you&#x27;re going to be paying that anyhow. For instance - my goto - 12V DC gearmotors. I can buy one kind from a supplier of Ametek (maybe Mouser or Digikey); I will pay whatever the high cost of shipping such an item to my door in addition to the price. Have you ever priced those motors in small quantities?<p>When you can get them...I&#x27;ve seen prices 10-20x over the equivalent motor from a supplier in China. What would cost $15.00 in China for a single motor, can be up to $100.00 or more from a US manufacturer for the same specs. Let&#x27;s say it cost $10.00 to ship to my door, whether from China or the US, and let&#x27;s say the Chinese supplier adds on an extra $5.00 &quot;just because fee&quot; - well, which is cheaper? $110.00 dollars for the US motor, or $30.00 for the Chinese motor?<p>It&#x27;s all a farce in my opinion - this administration essentially raising prices, which is going to be passed on to the consumer ultimately, trying to gain support from US small businesses (that&#x27;s the political angle), at the expense of the rest of consumers, and is selling it with some kind of idea or expectation that this is somehow going to lead to the United States becoming a large scale manufacturer of &quot;everything&quot; that we get from China now. Of course what isn&#x27;t said is that, even if that fantasy somehow did become true - those items manufactured here would still cost a hell of a lot more to make, and they would be virtually unsaleable on the international market because of that (let&#x27;s ignore the fact that we&#x27;ll be lucky if other countries ever buy from us again).<p>I see a very, very bleak future ahead for this country - no matter what happens with this current administration or the next. Maybe that was always going to be the case. The problem is, prior to this admin, that date was likely out a few decades - now those decades have been erased, and that future is happening now (and it is worse than it would have been had it happened &quot;naturally&quot; I think).<p>I say if you are an American and are under 30 years of age, and you have any marketable skills at all, you might want to think long and hard about emigrating. Dead serious on this."

"There is no market for safer bike helmets.<p>Bike helmets are sold on the basis of look, feel, and most importantly weight.  Nobody is touting real safety.

And SNELL, for sportbike riders who actually want to keep their face on their heads after a crash.  I have never seen a bicyclist with a full face helmet on the road.  Bicyclists, like the harley riders, care far more about comfort and style than actual safety.  At 50kph the asphalt doesn&#x27;t care whether you just fell off a bicycle or a motorcycle.  Please prove me wrong.  Please find me a pic of someone riding a bicycle on a road in a snell motorcycle helmet. I have seen plenty of them in the downhill community, never among commuters.<p>My point is that this new material will not be used to make safer helmets.

"How about giving us back the features we lost with Windows 10?<p>Like if I want a desktop shortcut to Notepad in W7 I open the Start menu, begin typing Notepad, and when it shows up in the search results I drag the icon onto the desktop or right click on it and hit &quot;send to desktop&quot;.

"This piece has the feeling of being written by &quot;every Friday is Hawaiian T-shirt day&quot; after his employer went all remote and he needed a new task.<p>I have worked remotely more than not and it&#x27;s not ideal. I suspect that if teleportation machines existed, then remote work wouldn&#x27;t be a thing. Once you leave the office for the day (or leave the house to go to the office) then the logistical problems start (where do I find an affordable place to live.) Logistical problems for employees become logistical issues for employers. Working remotely is a trade-off and much of the time it works well enough.<p>I&#x27;m guessing that most early remote workers get relatively cushy setups with allowances for equipment and good salaries. As remote becomes more common, then I bet that gets squeezed. Employers shouldn&#x27;t expect that the average person can make it work. If you don&#x27;t have a dedicated quiet office area then it gets real difficult. Pets are a distraction. Other people in the home are a distraction (and it&#x27;s not their fault, they have the right to &quot;be at home&quot;.) If you have a significant other living at home full time and that person is in a grumpy mood, then good luck.<p>I feel that people who can make it work are those who either live in a cave with no other living creatures or they have the bread to get a big enough house and funds to create an operations center in a dedicated room. Everyone else should at least get a desk at a co-working space.<p>There&#x27;s also a lot which gets lost in the communication of remote working. The communication you do have is much more mercenary. A group of special operators can carry out a mission together and even do so with mostly radio silence. But these people lose out of a lot of the more interesting elements of civilian life. Alice is an avatar and emoji&#x27;s who can get stuff done in remote space. But you don&#x27;t get to see her world class key short-cut skills from which you could open up a whole new way of thinking about your own operations. You don&#x27;t see the real pressure your boss or manager is under and you get far less information about how things work because they won&#x27;t be casually confiding in you at the water cooler. You don&#x27;t need a NORAD display to show major events and weather conditions around the world to see what challenges your collaborators will be up against in getting things done the coming day.<p>Remote work kind of sucks. Where do I take the survey? ;)"

"Reading the actual study [1], the headline is a bit deceptive. The study looked at audits between 2000 and 2010, a period during which funding to the IRS increased, and found that generally more funding for audits led to more money recovered from audits (duh). But that $34.3B figure is over 10 years, so it&#x27;s a tiny fraction of a percent of overall federal revenue, and it&#x27;s not offset by the amount of more money the IRS would have taken to run those audits.<p>Also unmentioned is the very real negative externalities that IRS audits cause. Audits disproportionately affect poor people [2], who are also the least able to spend time dealing with them. The United States already has extremely low tax evasion rates [3]. Rather than spending money to catch more of the very few cheaters by audits, other country&#x27;s tax authorities have found &quot;nudge&quot; letters were found to be similarly effective and vastly cheaper.<p>[1] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.aaajournals.org&#x2F;doi&#x2F;abs&#x2F;10.2308&#x2F;accr-52520?utm_source=15-kelley-research-on-irs-budget-cuts&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=How+do+IRS+resources+affect+the+corporate+audit+process?&amp;utm_campaign=ag"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.aaajournals.org&#x2F;doi&#x2F;abs&#x2F;10.2308&#x2F;accr-52520?utm_s...</a><p>[2] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;projects.propublica.org&#x2F;graphics&#x2F;eitc-audit"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;projects.propublica.org&#x2F;graphics&#x2F;eitc-audit</a><p>[3] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.researchgate.net&#x2F;figure&#x2F;Size-and-development-of-tax-evasion-in-of-GDP-in-38-OECD-countries-accounting-for_tbl2_256040463"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.researchgate.net&#x2F;figure&#x2F;Size-and-development-of-...</a>"

"The whole container safety story has been a mess&#x2F;cluster<i></i><i></i>&#x2F;bag-of-tricks since the very beginning. Unlike BSD jails, security was never number one priority for containers. Just take a look at what GCE&#x2F;AWS use respectively. The former built an entire syscall proxy with Gvisor while the latter uses a hypervisor based solution with Firecracker (think mini-VMs). Anything in production that touches foriegn code can&#x27;t really use generic out-of-the-box container systems like Docker. There is a whole bunch of tech such as Hyper Container, Kata, Runq etc. all so that you can run them on a hypervisor and get proper sandboxing. All in all quite disappointing to be honest.<p>(The main downside of hypervisors is that they are difficult to run on low-cost commodity cloud like Digital Ocean. You are forced to use bare metal stuff like Hetzner, AWS, Paket Cloud etc. The whole point of cloud is that the hardware&#x2F;infrastructure is mostly abstracted away. If I have to run my own hypervisor just to ensure the container doesn&#x27;t get broken out of, what&#x27;s the point even calling it cloud?)"

"I happened to use all three of the Sun Labs languages the article mentions, around that time.

I also got an advance look at what became Java, and later I wrote some of the first Java application code outside of Sun, plus some fancier GUI widgets.<p>All three languages were innovative, but I&#x27;d say Self had more innovations.  Students of programming languages would do well to take a look at Self, even though things like JIT, prototype object models, and direct-manipulation graphics worlds are now used elsewhere."

"I no longer live in Helsinki, but I am curious how quick the local homeless and the Balkan Roma migrants have been to settle into Oodi as a free, warm place to hang out at during the day. Starting from around 2010 there started to be examples of “defensive architecture” in the Helsinki city center to discourage those two demographics from hanging around, e.g. removing the once ample seating at the entrance to the Kirjasto 10 library that Oodi supersedes. Such architectural changes had a small but nevertheless rather unsavory impact on the center."

It&#x27;s not that it&#x27;s hard to understand, it&#x27;s just poorly highlighted in most namespace discourse that I&#x27;ve seen.

"There is something I cannot understand and this has already become a cliche:
&gt; Technology industry is an extremely fast-moving one. Many technologies used today didn&#x27;t even exist&#x2F;were popular a decade ago; in 2009, mobile app development and blockchain were pretty much unheard of. Engineers constantly need to upgrade their skills to stay relevant to the demands of the job market. Engineering is a great career for passionate individuals who like to learn.<p>Why would anyone give this advice? Can we stop handing out this advice and encourage everyone to stand up for their rights instead? If you think about it, by proxy this gives you the following advice: as a programmer you will have no life outside of work and you are supposed to be an idiot who spends his time working and studying outside office hours even when you could spend time with your family. So yeah, go for it and suck it up you idiot.<p>At least that&#x27;s how most employers handle this problem. And interestingly by comparison no-one tells a MBA diploma holder that it&#x27;s a great career for passionate individuals who like to spend their whole life studying.<p>And before you think that I am against studying, that&#x27;s not the case at all. If my company pays for it and I can kick back on a sofa during working hours to study I am fine with it. But I cannot see any value studying something on my own expense on my own time which will be outdated in 3 years anyway and so by definition it only benefits my employer."

"&gt; Epic Aerospace: Epic is manufacturing inexpensive space tugs to deliver satellites into geostationary orbit. The 21-year-old founder has been building rockets since he was 16, and is now managing a team of seven aerospace engineers with Epic Aerospace. The founder describes propulsion as one of the biggest problems for satellite companies, in that it can take up to two years to qualify new satellite systems and can cost up to $30 million. The problem they’re solving is moving satellites from low Earth orbit directly into geostationary orbit. Epic’s tug is half the cost of the competition and is reusable. They’re currently working with Satellogic, and chasing what the founder says is a $3.1 billion geostationary insertion market.<p>So, uh... what&#x27;s the big propulsion breakthrough?

"Keeping the coal plants online is just another way of paying welfare to the workers and the firms that own them. Taking money from everyone else and giving it to the outdated machines and workers with outdated skills.<p>Note that I&#x27;m not saying that there is anything <i>wrong</i> with being on welfare.  But as a society I think we should decouple our determination of who deserves to be on welfare from our decision about how rapidly we want to destroy our environment.<p>In other words, let&#x27;s just pay them normal food stamps or welfare checks, not keep the polluting plants open for decades longer than necessary.<p>For some reason many American workers feel totally proud being the indirect recipients of corporate welfare, yet would feel ashamed simply getting food stamps every month. There is zero difference between the two, except that in this case the food stamps are a LOT better for the environment."

"«<i>…an undervalued currency, by raising the cost of imports, acts as a kind of consumption tax for household and so reduces disposable household income.

"I wonder what the sentiment would be if the situation was reversed.<p>Here we have a developer effectively looking to pay below market rates for artists, and then unsurprisingly not finding many good artists willing to do that long term.

Cherish them when you find them.</i><p>If the context of the discussion was about developers instead of artists, how would HackerNews feel about someone lamenting the fact that they can&#x27;t get any &quot;affordable&quot; developers to work on their projects?<p>Also, as an aside:<p><i>The key problem here is that, when most people say, &quot;Your art looks bad,&quot; what they mean is, &quot;I want art that is good.&quot; They mean, &quot;I want AAA-quality art.&quot; And I can&#x27;t make that.

"&gt; Statistics I uncovered were deeply disturbing — fewer than 16 percent of adults diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder were employed full-time, for example.<p>Autism has changed its definition though. Adults with autism are often diagnosed under the old criteria and are extreme, often barely verbal. Now that Asperger&#x27;s (and a couple of other milder types) are rolled into autism (stuff that older people didn&#x27;t bother diagnosing - functional people didn&#x27;t need diagnoses back before every kid with a diagnosed got funded) you&#x27;d expect better outcomes because it&#x27;s not just the extreme non-functional ones getting diagnosed."

"I see this as an example where the system works. Valve has an incentive to pay for bugs. The researcher than has an incentive to disclose them privately. If Valve doesn&#x27;t pay fairly, the bug is disclosed, Valve pays the price and is forced to fix it, and be running a scam of a bug bounty program, they&#x27;ve exposed themselves to more disclosures. Valve now has an incentive to fix their program either by working with this bug hunter or increasing payouts so other hunters beat him to the point. This is how the system should work. Decentralized self-regulation needs people like Valve to fuck up once in a while so that the forces at play sufficiently punish them until they improve their process."
"I fully support legalizing all drugs, but don&#x27;t understand why the latest wave of criminal justice reform tolerates property crimes. Crimes like smash and grabs, purse snatching, bike thefts, vandalism, littering, and shoplifting clearly have defined victims and lower the quality of life for everyone.<p>It&#x27;s perfectly possible to be a heroin addict and an upstanding citizen at the same time. The same cannot be said of a bike thief. The vast majority of even hardcore homeless drug addicts do not engage in malicious property crimes. It&#x27;s only a small fraction, that also tends to be the most violent and socially pathological.<p>Vigorous enforcement of property crime improves the life for everyone in the city. Doubly so for the otherwise law-abiding drug users, who most often bear the worse brunt of the anti-social property criminals. The best way to sell drug policy reform to law and order conservatives is to redirect those resources to non-victimless crimes. Not just throw your hands up in the air and give up on enforcing any laws whatsoever."

"Also in 1968, the french singer — and hobbyist mathematician — Boby Lapointe ¹ proposed a graphical representation and pronunciation system for hexadecimal numbers, named bibi-binary ².

I feel like Node &#x2F; Express is great, but I also sometimes feel like it’s not a proper framework, in that you end up assembling a lot of code by hand (ex: auth, data modeling) and after a few projects it’s tedious. Also, Node only offers concurrency as an unnatural afterthought...<p>I’ve dabbled in Django and it seems to solve some of those problems, but I also feel like web programming in an OO dynamic scripting language isn’t that far away from doing it in JS so I might as well learn something mind-blowingly new...<p>I’ve been exposed to functional programming in OCaml in a rigorous college course and absolutely loved it, how would you guys rate learning Phoenix + Elixir in my case?"

"I hesitate to wade into this, since I have a lot of admiration for these two men, and I am only a mediocre speaker of Pulaar, the western dialect spoken by Fulani, whose eastern dialect is Fulfulde. I have seen several variations of this story making the rounds over the last few years, and it is full of misconceptions about the Fulani communities across the Sahel, and more generally about linguistics (and language politics) of trans-national communities. It is unfortunate that in this particular article Microsoft repeats many of the errors of the Atlantic[1], and the Letterform Archive [2], and adds its own self-congratulatory spin to it.<p>The first misconception is that Pulaar&#x2F;Fulfulde is&#x2F;was rarely written. Despite the experiences of the Barry brothers, the language has been written for hundreds of years. There are manuscripts  in Arabic script that attest to this - unfortunately these are generally poorly catalogued, but BU&#x27;s African Ajami Library lists 25 [3] and the British Library has several collections [4]. There is a strong historical argument that the Fulani were actually the primary instigators of literacy in pre-colonial West Africa, from the 15th and 16th centuries. The practice of writing Pulaar&#x2F;Fulfulde with Arabic script did without question wane in the 20th c. - particularly among the more educated and urban communities which the Barry brothers come from. This led to decreased standardisation of the language as written in the Arabic script, especially as Fulani communities came to have stronger ties to national identities than to their transnational identity as Fulani. At the same time, the general push for literacy in languages written with Latin script in the region (mostly French and English) led to a loss in language prestige for Pulaar&#x2F;Fulfulde as it had less utility as a lingua franca, and was not the language of religion, trade or politics, in the way it had been.<p>By the 1990&#x27;s, however there was substantial linguistic work done on Pulaar&#x2F;Fulfulde and a modified Latin alphabet was widely in use in the linguistic and academic community, which is currently seen on almost all Wikipedia articles on the subject. This is marked by &#x27;hooked&#x27; letters for plosives, as in Fulɓe, which this Microsoft article writes &quot;Fulbhe.&quot; The fact that this was not widely enough known that the Barry brothers came across it before developing a new standard for writing is testament to the fragmentation within the Fulani community, but I think it also reflects the fact that they did not come at the issue from a linguistics background. Nonetheless, this pre-existing writing standard does accurately represent all of the sounds in Pulaar&#x2F;Fulfulde (and also is not much different from many other African languages in the region written with a Latin alphabet). It also was used for printing a number of books in the early 2000s, and I knew of a handful of companies regularly printing books in Pulaar in Dakar, Senegal (where it is also a minority language). I once picked up an order for 10,000 books printed in Pulaar in 2005, typeset in this commonly accepted script adapted from the Latin Alphabet.<p>The second major misconception of the article, is that a language needs to have its own script to be accurately represented, or that having its own script enhances the literacy rate of a language. Other comments have touched on this, so I won&#x27;t dwell, but from a linguistic perspective (or even from a software language perspective) the opposite is more likely to be the case. The answer to the proliferation of different standards should almost never be to create a new standard - especially one that is not at all based on the previous standards (as Adlam is based on neither Arabic or Latin abjads&#x2F;alphabets). Literacy in Pulaar&#x2F;Fulfulde is almost certainly better served by doubling down on an existing standard that is accessible to those who most want to access it, rather than a new standard. There are 100-150 million Pulaar&#x2F;Fulfulde speakers, so even success in the range of thousands of Fulani who recognise Adlam doesn&#x27;t mean it is likely to overtake the actual pragmatic literacy of those hundreds of millions who already ready on a daily basis in Latin scripts, and could easily recognise the adapted letters.<p>From a political perspective, there might be a value in a new unifying standard that underscores the uniqueness of Fulɓe from their neighbours in Mauritania to Sudan. But in every one of those countries, the Fulɓe are a minority, and many of their communities are nomadic&#x2F;transhumant as well, further undermining their ability to integrate or oppose existing political structures. While I applaud Adlam as a commendable assertion of identity, and a valuable potential contribution to the linguistics and typography of West African languages (should it engage constructively with the field), it is politically doomed, and unfortunately lends credence to the dictum that &quot;a language is a dialect with an army.&quot;<p>Pulaar&#x2F;Fulfulde is an incredibly important language, but it hasn&#x27;t had an army since the fall of the Empire of Sokoto in 1903 to colonial powers. It has largely been seen as a dialect because of that, despite being one of the most widely spoken in Africa (Swahili is the only other African language with a claim to have more than 100 million native speakers).<p>[1] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theatlantic.com&#x2F;technology&#x2F;archive&#x2F;2016&#x2F;11&#x2F;the-alphabet-that-will-save-a-people-from-disappearing&#x2F;506987&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theatlantic.com&#x2F;technology&#x2F;archive&#x2F;2016&#x2F;11&#x2F;the-a...</a>

One thing I like about having React DevTools installed is you can easily see which sites use React because the little icon lights up. It&#x27;s a surprising amount these days; React is getting so popular.

"The plastics and chemicals industries -- as a chemistry professor used to put it -- are but a pimple on the butt of the petroleum fuels industry.<p>They are a tiny portion of what&#x27;s getting produced every day.

"&gt; [PAL colour] was designed in the 1960s to be backwards compatible with black-and-white TV receivers.<p>Fun fact: unlike for NTSC, this technically isn&#x27;t true, because there is not a preceding black-and-white format that PAL was compatible with. Rather, PAL&#x27;s black-and-white format (the line count and refresh rate) was defined at the same time as the colour standard.

I wonder: if the WSJ took steps to make their guest pass persist, would Apple view this as a security vulnerability?"
"Encarta was part of my first job out of university. I worked in Microsoft&#x27;s Multimedia Division, tasked with creating the first video and audio drivers for Windows. IIRC the BMP, WAV, and AVI file formats all came from this team at about this time.<p>In the summer of &#x27;91, I was tasked with assembling a 386 PC with an early CD-ROM drive to demo an early build of Encarta at a trade show. It was a lot of effort to find a combination of hardware and drivers that would work reliably together.<p>Encarta itself (at least at that time) was written as a Word document. Hyperlinks were defined using footnotes, and animation and audio placeholders were defined with custom OLE objects. The whole thing got exported as RTF and fed to a compiler, which created the runtime data structures optimized for CD-ROM access and that also built a full-text search index. The compilation was very slow and required huge amounts of RAM.<p>Around this time, the team had some awareness of HTML as one of many emerging hypertext markup languages, but the internet was still a few years away and no one knew what format would &quot;win&quot; for hypertext. In any case, there were no tools or browsers at all, so we had to build everything -- including our own search engine for the CD-ROM."

"They might make up for their electricity bill 1:1 but they&#x27;ll never go neutral on the amount of carbon wealth they consume in payment for their services.<p>Imagine I have a business where I busk for money with my guitar outside of a coal plant and a single coal minor is my patron. I may be &quot;carbon neutral&quot; but in fact I owe my whole existence to coal being mined and burnt. Coal is my life blood and the sole source of wealth in my life. I may as well mine the coal myself and play guitar for myself, and if you consider me and the miner to be a unit it&#x27;s obvious the two of us are living on coal and the fact that he does all the work while I play guitar hardly means anything.<p>Companies like stripe are sufficiently separated from coal and oil that they can believe they don&#x27;t suck at the teat of fossil fuels, and that the only coal wealth they consume is whatever powers their light bulbs and servers. But ultimately you can track back the wealth that comes their way - all of it - to operations that generate quite a bit more emissions.<p>We can run subsidies and credits in little isolated corners of our economy, but it&#x27;s like running a refrigerator in a closed room.

"This is something that I&#x27;ve struggled with myself so I can only give you advice as I&#x27;ve learned it from my perspective.<p>Math is a big field so you have to understand what parts you&#x27;re really interested in and how you want information to be presented so that you&#x27;ll learn it. For example, I&#x27;m interested in computation aspects of mathematics (information theory, computation group theory, abstract algebra, analysis, etc.) and I always prefer a &quot;computer programmers&quot; intuition in how to learn these subjects. That is, understanding how to &#x27;program it&#x27;, whatever that means for the different subjects I&#x27;m interested in.<p>Here is a small list of intuition I&#x27;ve learned about finding good resources:<p>* Books, and sometimes textbooks, are still a valuable resource. It&#x27;s still the case that having a book on a subject that has curated content is better than the random Wikipedia articles or blog posts on the subject. Use Wikipedia, obviously, and look at blog posts, but I search for books in the subject area, especially if it&#x27;s a field I&#x27;m not familiar with.<p>* When looking for books, prefer books that have &quot;elementary&quot; in the title, as in &quot;elementary introduction&quot;. The more &quot;advanced&quot; books are talking about the bounds of research in the area, often fussing over esoteric issues whereas the &quot;elementary&quot; books give the foundation of knowledge in that area.<p>* Ideally for me, books would have &quot;fundamental algorithms&quot; somewhere in the title, as these books usually are exactly what I need to understand a field.<p>* When reading, ideally I make sure to do the exercises or run through the proofs myself. Mathematics is not a spectator sport and a large part of it is &quot;learn by doing&quot;. Finding good resources so those exercises are meaningful is hard but they still need to be done.<p>* I often check MathOverflow, MathUndeflow, Physics.Stackexchange, CStheory.Stackexchange and other accompanying sites. There are a surprising number of good answers to questions of the form &quot;what is the motivation behind...&quot;. As the subjects get more esoteric, these questions become more infrequent these resources are still invaluable. Asking questions on these sites is also an option and usually helpful.<p>* In the past I&#x27;ve watched more in depth lectures from mathematicians, either from conferences or from things like OpenCourseWare. There&#x27;s a lot of &#x27;folklore&#x27; wisdom that&#x27;s embedded with people that sometimes comes out when viewing actual researchers talk about their research that wouldn&#x27;t otherwise be apparent or emphasized in papers.<p>* I sometimes visit blogs from mathematicians or about mathematicians.<p>When I was younger in college, I was fortunate to have a social group of friends who were graduate students and TAs that had an appetite for discovery and teaching. There was a lot of folklore and intuition that was taught which would have been difficult to find otherwise. I think many graduate students in mathematics essentially use their exposure to their advisor, other teachers and other students to build that intuition.<p>I should also mention that there isn&#x27;t &quot;one way&quot; to learn about these subjects. I take a computational perspective because that&#x27;s my preference but I&#x27;m fully aware that not everyone thinks that way. Every person has their own perspective on what&#x27;s fundamental and how they learn and build intuition even if they can be grouped in to rough categorizations (though I&#x27;d be hard pressed to quantify those categorizations). I&#x27;ve found the way I learn and optimize for it and I unfortunately have a hard time when information isn&#x27;t presented in the way I need it to be, at least initially while I&#x27;m building intuition and learning a subject for the first time.<p>I can&#x27;t find the quote now but there was a mathematician that was talking about Erdos and how Erdos didn&#x27;t have deep knowledge or at least didn&#x27;t use &quot;higher mathematics&quot; like Lie theory or other higher abstractions. Yet Erdos was prolific in his sense with his &quot;elementary&quot; methods, probably because he understood his tools and the problems deeply. As an analogy, it&#x27;d be like someone who knows assembly well trying to analyze a Haskell script. The Haskell programmer might have intuition from the constructs of that language but someone who knows assembly well understands that each of the abstractions in Haskell must eventually boil down to assembly instructions and can understand it from that perspective.<p>I also try to employ the &quot;20% effort for 80% gain&quot; rule. There are usually some basic concepts so learning them as fast as possible is the goal. This also allows for maximum gain for effort spent as if the field is interesting, I can dive deeper or move onto another if it&#x27;s not.<p>I try to avoid resources that are &quot;TED talk&quot; like, press releases, or other &quot;feel good&quot; resources, like 3Brown1Blue. These are great for being inspired by mathematics (which is important!) but are usually devoid of content. Resources like 3Brown1Blue I find especially pernicious as they couch deep understanding by regurgitating facts without providing any fundamental insight.<p>I tend to stay away from Springer books as they&#x27;re usually dense. They might be good for reference but for initial learning I&#x27;ve found them to be pretty bad.<p>People often say &quot;read the original papers&quot; but I found this to be horrible advice as the original papers often are a very rough &#x27;proto&#x27; model of the ideas presented and don&#x27;t benefit from work that&#x27;s been done to simplify and extract the important parts of the theory without the cruft. Often times, mathematicians have their own pet notation which further get in the way of understanding.

"I&#x27;ve been playing around with the data made available [1] by the states that are part of the Streamlined Sales Tax system [2].<p>The boundary file address records include, among other things:<p><pre><code>  address range start
  address range end
  odd&#x2F;even&#x2F;both flag
  directional prefix
  street name
  street suffix
  directional postfix
  zip code
</code></pre>
The address range specifies the range of numerical addresses that the record applies to, and the odd&#x2F;even&#x2F;both flag indicates if it is for just the odd address, just the even addresses, or both.<p>The direction prefix and suffix are supposed to be one of {blank, N, S, E, W, NE, NW, SE, SW}, but some states botch that and I&#x27;ve seen EA, EB, NO, SO, and WE end up in there.<p>The suffix field is for things like LANE, AVE, ST, and the like. It is a 4 character field, so a street that residents thing of as ELM AVENUE would be name=ELM suffix=AVE in the boundary file. Or it would be name=&quot;ELM AVENUE&quot; with no suffix. (There are even some with AVENUE in the name and something else in the suffix, such as ROOSEVELT AVENUE ALY in Albany GA. The ALY is the suffix). (There are a 318 distinct suffixes across all the SST states, for the curious [3]).<p>Anyway, my point is that the data is kind of loose.<p>I want to be able to take what a user puts on an address form:<p><pre><code>  address
  city
  state
  zip code
</code></pre>
and find a good match in the boundary files. Most people manage to put something reasonable in the city, state, and zip code fields, and manage to put their street address at the start of the address field, so I can pretty reliably get the zip code and the street number. It&#x27;s the rest of the address line that is problematic.<p>At first I was trying to figure out what in there might be prefix, postfix, and suffix to isolate just the street name. But because of both the aforementioned looseness of the boundary data, and differences between how the user might think of their address and how their state thinks of it, this didn&#x27;t work too well.<p>I was considering keeping an index that maps words that occur in street names to those street names, and then looking for the longest word in the user supplied address and looking up all streets in the user&#x27;s zip code that contain that word and that include the user&#x27;s street number. If that returned more than one match, the idea was then to look at the prefix, postfix, and suffix and see how well those matched with things in the user address. Looking at a few addresses that had given me trouble, though, it looked like this plan to resolve them would still be tricky and unreliable.<p>So then I decided to try a Levenshtein distance approach. Given zip, street number, street, where street is whatever the user included in the &quot;address&quot; field after the street number, I pull up all records in my boundary DB that match on zip code and street number. I don&#x27;t even include street name in the query.<p>Then for each result, I take the prefix, name, suffix, and postfix and join them separated by space. I then simply take the one with the smallest Levenshtein distance from what the user supplied. With this, I no longer care if something is name=ELM, suffix=AVE or name=&quot;ELM AVE&quot;, suffix=&quot;&quot;.<p>This has worked remarkably well. Even if the user throws on stuff that doesn&#x27;t belong (some people manage to put the city, state, and&#x2F;or zip in the address box) it usually doesn&#x27;t throw it off. It raises the Levenshtein distance of the correct match by sometimes a lot...but it also raises the incorrect match distances too, so the correct one still wins.<p>The boundary files also have secondary address fields, for things like apartments, unit, suites, and the like. These are an abbreviation (APT, e.g.) and low and high ends of a range, and an odd&#x2F;even&#x2F;both flag. Unfortunately the ranges for these aren&#x27;t always numeric. E.g., there is 695 E MORRILL AVE in Columbus, OH, which has secondary fields of &quot;AP&quot;, &quot;A&quot;, &quot;M&quot;, and the odd&#x2F;even&#x2F;both flag set to both. I assume that means Apartments A-M.<p>So far, I&#x27;ve ignored the secondary address fields. Every time I&#x27;ve seen more than one result for the lowest Levenshtein distance, the matches have been close enough to each other to be in the same taxing districts, so would have the same rate and the tax would be allocated to the same entities, so further resolution is not necessary.<p>At some point I&#x27;ll take my scripts that clean up the raw rate and boundary files and transform them into a form more suitable for DB use, and that make sqlite and mysql databases from those, and that do the address matching and also sales tax lookups by address, and put &#x27;em on Github, but that will probably not be very soon.<p>[1] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.streamlinedsalestax.org&#x2F;Shared-Pages&#x2F;rate-and-boundary-files&#x2F;rate-and-boundary-file-updates"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.streamlinedsalestax.org&#x2F;Shared-Pages&#x2F;rate-and-bo...</a><p>[2] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.streamlinedsalestax.org&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.streamlinedsalestax.org&#x2F;</a><p>[3] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pastebin.com&#x2F;tQLGTGS9"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pastebin.com&#x2F;tQLGTGS9</a>"
Banks have worked with the credit reporting companies to factor out medical debt and medical debt default&#x2F;collections from FICO scores.  I recently did a refinance and not only did they not say anything about lingering medical collections they didn&#x27;t mention about $10k in back taxes that were obviously on my tax returns.  I remember getting raked over the coals on this stuff fifteen years ago. They always required me to pay off any outstanding taxes or past collections back then.
"There&#x27;s an assumption if you use human raters, you won&#x27;t have false negatives or positives, but even human beings disagree over how to categorize speech, what&#x27;s homophobic, what&#x27;s legitimate sarcasm or irony, what is violent content.<p>In fact, on top of human raters exhibiting classification problems in the face of ambiguity, there is also the issue of bias.

"I wonder if there are still more Klingon speakers than Esperanto today.

"I was going to say “I recall when I had sepsis in my teens”, but the truth of it is that I don’t - there’s a six week hole in my memory, that skips straight from lying in a pool of blood and puss on the floor of the kitchen at school, having a mop thrust in my face, to lying in a bed in hospital with tubes snaking out of me.<p>The weird thing is, despite being unconscious for over a month, I woke up feeling like I hadn’t missed anything, and even now I look back at this with slight disbelief - surely you’re thinking of someone else, surely it wasn’t that long. I felt like I’d been out longer after a general for surgery a few years ago.<p>They did run a whole battery of neurological tests on me once I was conscious and eating - they were pretty surprised I had no obvious brain damage - I had maintained a fever over 108 for several days, despite ice baths and the, what, 20g of daily antibiotics? I do wonder if there was some, but rather more subtle than what was being looked for.<p>Re-integrating was weird. For everyone else I’d been as good as dead - they’d seen me carted off in an ambulance, and then a few weeks later term had ended. I on the other hand basically went straight from the end of one school term to the beginning of the next with zero intervening time, and nobody could figure out why I was pissed off. They kept asking me about what had happened - and I answered honestly that they probably knew more than I did.<p>It also sucked that I had no soft landing back into classes, and in the time I’d been unconscious they’d started calculus - I came back and had to differentiate and integrate and had no frigging idea what I was actually doing - I remember sitting in an A-level maths exam a year later and <i>finally</i> having the revelation that it was about curves and rates of change.<p>All this because I had what looked like a zit on my knee. It grew until I couldn’t fit trousers over my leg, school offered me a sticking plaster, and said I wasn’t getting out of sport that easily. Then my leg opened up one night fetching water in the kitchen, and I lost consciousness. I’ll never forget the sight of custard in crude oil swirling over the linoleum - perhaps that’s one side effect of the coma - my last conscious moment is vivid in the extreme.<p>Anyway, that brush with death didn’t change my outlook one bit, but then again I was an invincible 16 year old. The ones since then have definitely left their mark."

"Professional quant here. I have to say I strongly disagree with the conclusions of the OP.<p>&gt; They were all found by using phrases like &quot;predict stock market&quot; or &quot;predict forex&quot; or &quot;predict bitcoin&quot; and terms related to those.<p>Yeah, searching for any finance papers with &quot;predict&quot; or &quot;machine learning&quot; is literally the lowest quality tier you can get. These papers are often written by grad students who can pump an easy paper out by &quot;applying&quot; some already known ML algorithm to financial markets. Of course it&#x27;s not gonna work. It also kills me when I see ML models who need stationarity assumptions applied to non-stationary time series data. Yeah, good luck with that.<p>THAT being said, there is lots of high quality research which has been replicated over and over, showing that alpha does exist in the market (and which funds have made billions off of). I would like to see the OP try to replicate some of  these instead. To give some simple examples:<p>1. Try searching for papers with the keywords &quot;and the cross section of expected returns&quot;. For example, the momentum factor which can be tested and replicated with only linear regression.

"When someone initially looks at all the bespoke interfaces on an OS that could easily be provided by a single API, one’s first and natural response is to wonder whether all this complexity has a non-historical justification for it. On Linux&#x2F;BSD, I would argue that these choices are mostly historical and do not originate from some theoretical model of how an OS should be structured.<p>But let’s say we sit down and write a new OS: should the API for sockets be the same as for local files? Should we be able to write and read from processes by catting to and from some synthetic process file on disk? Should I be able to mount the internet on a directory and interact with sites be ls’ing their directory? Maybe I should be able to mount remote cpus and pin tasks to them? We can even take this further: registers as files, memory addresses as files, pixels and windows as files, etc etc.<p>All of these things sound super nice, and in many ways, they are. The everything is a file concept can be taken further than even Plan9. And fundamentally, this is what the post is arguing for. Except instead of everything is a file on a file system, everything is a table on a database.<p>The advantages of this approach are pretty obvious, we provide a simple and consistent interface: read&#x2F;write for files, or select&#x2F;insert&#x2F;delete for tables. This allows a development surface that appears very simple and straightforward.<p>The problem is that this simplicity is an illusion and just a black box abstraction over what’s really going on. In many ways, it actually makes things more complicated as read&#x2F;write become incredibly polymorphic. Maybe the API stays the same (syntax) for everything but the actual semantics still remain complex, maybe even more complicated than distinct API’s.<p>Even when the complexity of the semantics between the two approaches are similar, there are other problems. There’s arguments to made the heterogeneous resources should not all be provided by a homogeneous interface. For example a call to a data structure that has O(n) probably shouldn’t have the same interface as O(n^2). It makes it very easy for a developer to write incredibly inefficient code.<p>At its core, this dichotomy is best epitomized by Richard Gabriel’s “Worse is Better.” In the essay he talks about the difference between the New Jersey school and the MIT School. One of the differences is how the two schools think about APIs. The MIT approach is to design opaque and complete interfaces that solve the problem correctly at the expense of underlying complexity. The New Jersey or Unix approach is to value simplicity of the system at the expense of a more complicated API.<p>You can see an example of this in the read() system call. read() in Unix is hard to use and annoying as hell. There’s many bugs that stem from it’s misuse. The system call can (and does!) return less information that asked for even if it didn’t hit an EOF. Making read() always fill the buffer except for an EOF is a very hard problem and would have created a lot of extra complexity in the system. The MIT approach would be to implement this complexity as a simple interface is more important.<p>As you can probably imagine, there’s pros and cons to both approaches. Maybe the MIT way is better because many more people are going to be using read() than actually hacking on the OS. Or maybe the Unix way is better because the underlying simplicity of a system allows developers to attain a mental model of what’s going on.<p>If someone is interested, look at the OpenGenera source code (MIT school) vs say Plan9. OpenGenera is undoubtably a sublime and beautiful system but the code required to do it is just absurd. Plan9 is maybe less sublime, but the code itself is dead simple. Also you could compare the GNU userland vs the OpenBSD one.<p>tl;dr: There are costs to homogenous APIs for heterogeneous things: complexity, hard to form a mental model, easy for a programmer to misuse unintentionally. There are benefits to: consistency, beauty, easy programming.<p>Personally I like to take a balanced approach and decide on a case by case basis on how to trade off simplicity and correctness. Being a dogmatic programmer isn’t a good thing and it certainly doesn’t help your employers."

"Worth noting that this basically means that all of the JS engines are converging on what JavaScriptCore pioneered:<p>- More than just two tiers (JSC has four, and I guess Moz has four too now; I guess it&#x27;s just a matter of time before V8 follows).<p>- Bottom tiers must include a fast interpreter that uses JIT ABI and collects types (Ignition and this Moz interpreter smells a lot like JSC&#x27;s LLInt, which pioneered exactly this for JS).<p>It&#x27;s weird that they kept the C++ interpreter.  But not too weird, if the IC logic in the new interpreter is costly.  In the LLInt, the IC&#x2F;type logic is either a win (ICs are always a win) or neutral (value profiling and case flag profiling costs nothing in LLInt).<p>Also worth noting that this architecture - a JIT ABI interpreter that collects types as a bottom tier - is older than any JS engine.

A few large operators will emerge and park their cars overnight at some owned large lot far out of the city to recharge, maintain, etc, and there won’t be much need anymore.  So that could be a path to what author is talking about, long term. Of course does nothing for parking lot owners who just hold onto the property speculating..."

"We have servers in HK. Not to reach mainland China, but to service all SE Asia. We chose HK because it has the best balance of latency between all destinations. If PRC decides to move HK behind the great firewall, we&#x27;d move our servers, and so would most other companies. Last I checked, Great Firewall DPI takes around 100ms. I don&#x27;t have exact timing, it&#x27;s possible it&#x27;s different for ingress&#x2F;egress, or that it&#x27;s only on tcp connect, but 100ms means it&#x27;s reasonable for us to consider pretty much any other city in SE Asia, and a few outside. For reference, Taipei is around 20ms away from HK, and Manila is around 40ms. Singapore is problematic because they have a tiny number of external cables, and they had an incident a few years back where all but one cable was out of service for months.<p>Point is if HK moves behind the GFW, I&#x27;ll have some servers for sale.<p>EDIT: I&#x27;ll let my stupidity stand, but for correctness: Singapore has around 15 submarine cables as of 2018, but only 3 landing sites."

"Nice paper.<p>It is interesting to note how practical data structures have evolved over the last 20 years, since this paper was written. Balanced trees were pervasive back then and the primary workhorse in all database systems I designed or worked with. Today they are rarely used in new system designs, since the practical tradeoffs started making less and less sense over a decade ago. Balanced trees have a very high space overhead that becomes prohibitively costly as data sizes grow.<p>Succinct implicit tree structures are unbalanced, so in theory have higher latency variance, but they also can have a space overhead 2-3 orders of magnitude smaller. As a practical consequence, the cost of traversing a level in the tree is dramatically lower than for balanced trees. The number of levels traversed tends to be used in literature as a shorthand metric for &quot;optimality&quot; but it smuggles in the assumption that traversal costs are similar across algorithms in practice. Searching a nicely balanced O(logn) gigabyte metadata structure has a hard time competing with an equivalent unbalanced tree that fits the metadata entirely in L2 cache, even when the tree is very unbalanced (and the average case is much better).<p>I am not entirely sure when I stopped using balanced trees. I went from always using balanced trees to never using balanced trees, gradually over many years."
"React is already typed with props. I see no added use for TypeScript. Yet another list of packages makes maintaining very hard and inconsistent (as types are declared in variant ways). Explicit (and simple) functions as React (e.g. hooks) provides won&#x27;t need strongly typed code, less readability in my opinion.<p>If you&#x27;re building a library &#x2F; sdk, than Typescript comes in place and can make life easier for devs."
"Welcome to the world of soft realtime applications. Sounds like this one is just so bad that a) the designers didn&#x27;t realize that was what they were designing and b) consequently it failed to meet any of its deadlines in the UI domain.<p>One detail I&#x27;ve noticed is that even if you do a shitty job of hitting the deadlines, users will often find workarounds. As long as a critical mass of features respond consistently within the deadlines, users will fiddle around to make the rest work-- even if you tell them directly that it isn&#x27;t possible.<p>Say the dropdown menus here performed fast enough, but going to the &quot;next page&quot; required a bunch of DOM mutation or something that grinds to a halt for two seconds. I&#x27;d bet EMTs would have trained themselves to do branch prediction-- hit the button to change pages before setting it down, hit it again based on what the patient is communicating to the other EMT, and so forth. I&#x27;ve seen users do weirder stuff.<p>The fact that they discarded it altogether tells you how bad the UI was."

"So I take it, should these results be replicated and validated as scientifically sound, that smoke machines will be banned? Because it&#x27;s the same kind of aerosol with virtually the same ingredients.<p>I&#x27;m also curious - and maybe I missed it; it&#x27;s a dense paper - that while they mentioned the primary ingredients in &quot;bare&quot; vape liquids, they didn&#x27;t seem to mention the concentrations of each used in the study? Again, maybe I missed it...<p>If it wasn&#x27;t mentioned, I would be curious how different percentages of each affect the outcome.<p>For that matter - I would also be curious how &quot;vaping&quot; something similar - say perhaps atomized distilled water in a nebulizer - what kind of results are seen there, too.<p>While it may be that vaping liquids are &quot;bad&quot; (and any metals from the heating coil, as the study noted), how they compare to other similar liquids might be important in determining their relative danger.<p>Also - whether this reported danger is warranted or not? That is, when compared to other things in day-to-day breathing, where does this fall in terms of &quot;danger&quot;? Is it worse than being around a camp fire or fireplace? Is it worse than breathing air in a working kitchen? Is it worse than breathing the air while taking a hot shower?<p>Sure - the numbers can be made to look scary - but what is the objective truth, beyond the idea that &quot;yes, vaping even base liquids is worse than just breathing&quot; - I think we can agree that breathing in something more than clean air is worse for you, no matter what it is. But for all we know, we&#x27;re constantly breathing in microparticles of plastic and other pollution in greater rates and more often than even a heavy vaping device user.<p>Lots of questions and avenues that could be pursued in follow-up research on this topic, certainly. It was interesting to read about, especially as someone who occasionally vapes a caffeine-based (non-niccotine) liquid."

"Counting citations is a rubbish metric in general. It&#x27;s supposed to be a proxy
for reserach quality but it&#x27;s so easy to &quot;game&quot; (in the sense of optimising
for citation count, rather than research quality) that a high number of
citations doesn&#x27;t mean anything.<p>Neither does a low number of citations. For example, my field is small and
kind of esoteric, so we don&#x27;t get lots of citations either from the outside or
the inside (one of the most influential papers in the field has... 286
citations on Semantic Scholar; since 1995).<p>With a field as small as a couple hundred researchers it&#x27;s also very easy to
give the appearance of a citation mill. Given that papers will focus on a very
specific subject in the purview of the field, it is inevitable that each
researcher who studies that specific subject will cite the same handful of
researchers&#x27; papers over and over again- and be herself cited by them, since
she&#x27;s now publishing on the subject that interests them.<p>As to self-citations, like Ioannidis himself says there are legitimate
reasons, for instance, a PhD student publishing with her thesis advisor as a
co-author. The student will most probably be working on subjects that the
advisor has already published on and in fact will most likely be extending the
advisor&#x27;s prior work. So the advisor&#x27;s prior work will be cited in the
student&#x27;s papers.<p>So I&#x27;m really not sure what we&#x27;re learning in the general case by counting
citations, other than that a certain paper has a certain number of citations."

"A couple issues with the science here:<p>&gt;Between 2005 and 2015, global rates of fracking went from producing 31 billion cubic meters per year to 435 billion<p>&gt;In the last half of the 20th, century levels of methane in the atmosphere rose. They then plateaued, and spiking in 2008.<p>So the shale gas revolution started in 2005, but the spike didn&#x27;t occur until 2008? Also it isn&#x27;t clear if this was a transient spike or the author is referring to a sudden and sustained increase.<p>&gt; While methane released in the late 20th century was enriched with the carbon isotope 13C, Howarth highlights methane released in recent years features lower levels. That&#x27;s because the methane in shale gas has depleted levels of the isotope when compared with conventional natural gas or fossil fuels such as coal, he explained<p>First, all conventional gas is &quot;shale gas,&quot; except for a tiny minority of highly atypical cases where reservoir sections have experienced prolonged high temperatures and matured further. Thus almost all natural gas ultimately comes from shale - fracking is merely extracting it at the source, where it does not significantly differ in composition from gas which has migrated to reservoir in conventional extraction. So, second, I&#x27;m suspcious of the use of c13 to differentiate fracking and non fracking sourced methane, but I&#x27;m not a petrophysicist. It should be related to the age of the fluid, and I don&#x27;t expect shale gas to be substantially younger than reservoir gas in most cases."

"I only use air conditioning once or twice a year (in DC). This article was very interesting, but if you can&#x27;t rebuild your home you have fewer options.

"You can recycle polyethylene pretty easily on its own, and a lot of those plastic wraps that the article says aren&#x27;t recycled are made out of LDPE. HDPE and LDPE are great materials for a lot of things that you might otherwise make out of wood or 3D-print. It&#x27;s easy to machine, and it can be very strong and rigid for its weight.<p>Basically, you just shred the donor plastic, heat it to 300-350F, press the air out, and let it cool. With LDPE plastic wrap, you can fold and stack it instead of shredding it. You can also get cool tie-dye effects by using multiple colors in the same batch.<p>You can use plywood for the walls of your molds, and a toaster oven that you don&#x27;t plan on cooking with ever again can be a reasonable furnace. To compress the hot plastic, try making a loose-fitting lid and tamping or clamping it down while the plastic heats.<p>But make sure that it is polyethylene - some plastics, like PVC, release highly toxic fumes. And others, like polypropylene, are often mixed with plasticizers which evaporate into nasty fumes and reduce the quality of the recycled plastic."

"Typescript is a lot easier to deal with if you stop treating it as optional and do it from day 1. Avoid using the any type and things fall in to place. If it&#x27;s tedious, you&#x27;re probably doing something wrong or sub-optimal. Or you&#x27;re just dealing with a bit of hairy old javascript that probably needs a bit of refactoring in any case.<p>IMHO we&#x27;re reaching the point where typescript (or similar languages) should be used by default over untyped javascript in professional environments. It&#x27;s like having tests, which are also not generally considered optional. I&#x27;ve been in CTO type roles and already insist on it when I can. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m alone in this and many organizations only do typescript at this point."

I&#x27;d recommend against using them for anything bigger though - you&#x27;ll just spend all your time reinventing Django (badly).<p>I use Sanic for asynchronous web servers.<p>Falcon is great to use to build APIs - it&#x27;s raw and minimal and built to task.<p>Indeed in my latest project I use Django for the main web application, Flask for the mjpeg server and sanic as a long polling web server acting as a message queue server."
"No, the polarization (and attendant culture war) has been going on longer than social media as we know it have existed.

"I studied Philosophy in college (alongside CS).  It&#x27;s basically all about argumentation.  I do not see argumentation as anything negative, assuming the context is correct.  It is how we come to understand one another and, largely, the world.  Our intuitions, the automatic understanding that we come to from the blunt associative process in which our brain relates things, are almost always wrong in very profound ways (especially in modern society which the brains structure, which gives rise to those associative processes, did not evolve for).  Everything else comes from discussion and argument.<p>The correct context is necessary, though.  Equally as important as both participants (or more) using the same language, all participants must be interested and willing in participating.  I would recommend, if in something like a general chat environment, that you ask if they&#x27;re interested in discussing the topic.  If they&#x27;re not, then move along.  If they are, make it clear from the outset that you want to understand why they believe what they are claiming, what led them to the understanding, what they believe they gain from it, what evidence they might have, etc.  Asking questions, well made ones, can often go a long way.  But sometimes people just want to rant and aren&#x27;t in the headspace to have a sit-down real discussion.<p>There will still be times, regretfully frequent, where it will become clear that either one of the participants is engaging in bad faith or, more common, do not actually understand their own position clearly.  For many, their beliefs are accumulated like flotsam as they drift through life rather than through deliberate consideration of evidence.  Those people might benefit from hearing you speak, but not from a back-and-forth dialog.  There is very little general appreciation for finding out one is wrong.  Most people flinch away from it and take it as an insult and will interpret honest questions like &#x27;Why do you think that is?&#x27; as snide dismissal of their own positions, reading it incorrectly as an assumption that they are clearly wrong and you are just trying to figure out how they ever managed to become such an imbecile.  There can&#x27;t be any honest discussion with people in this position.  It will just devolve into them shouting no matter how calm you yourself remain.<p>There are always opportunities to engage with people honestly, for some people that takes a long time.  Often once they realize that your goal is not to make them look or feel like a fool, that your goal really is to understand a different position or even just explain your own so that it is understood even if not necessarily agreed with, most people will become more willing.  Some will only have earnest conversations with those they are familiar and close with.  As with all human interaction, it depends heavily on context.<p>I have always liked and tended towards a Socratic means of explanation (Socrates taught primarily by asking questions, getting the other person to essentially lead themselves to understand what he meant through recreating the reasoning process he himself followed) but I realized after awhile that a lot of people find this approach highly difficult to engage with.  They often see it as you &#x27;forcing&#x27; them to say things and &#x27;putting words in their mouth&#x27;.  This happens particularly with people who don&#x27;t have a reason-based basis for their beliefs but more of an emotional connection to the ideas and don&#x27;t like how saying certain things &#x27;feels&#x27; even if they can admit intellectually that they are actually true.<p>Argumentation is an art.  It probably can&#x27;t ever be made &#x27;simple&#x27;, but it is a critical part of our society and time invested in learning how to do it better through practice or study will usually be richly rewarded (at least in an intellectual and personal sense)."

"Does anybody know if employees will end up actually making any money from this massive acquisition, or if yet again board and investors found a way through some shenanigans to distribute all the wealth just to themselves?<p>EDIT: I&#x27;m being downvoted, but I&#x27;ve been increasingly hearing a shady Silicon Valley practice where, upon successful acquisition, the board will vote to emit a large number of new shares (think 5-10X the total pool), which will be redistributed just among execs and investors. So, if you are an employee who held on to your 0.1% (which, on 1B, might be worth 1M), you might find out that after the acquisition you are going to be diluted maybe to 0.01%. And this is after all the other &quot;healthy&quot; dilutions that have happened to the company over the years, as part of their financing rounds."

"Firstly, I&#x27;m an independent - I actually have a great deal of issues with both major parties.  My concern with abandoning the college starts with this observation:<p>Swing states are the states most likely to have divided government. And if divided government is good for anything, it is accountability. So with the Electoral College system, when we do wind up with a razor-thin margin in an election, it is likely to happen in a state where both parties hold some power, rather than in a state controlled by one party.  The Electoral college system focuses a great deal of energy on states in this condition when an election is close.<p>National Popular Vote (NPV) rewards states with high population - the higher the turnout, the more power for that state.  Additionally, under NPV, each state would certify its own &quot;national&quot; vote total. What would happen when there are charges of skullduggery? Would states really trust, with no power to verify, other state’s returns?<p>I have other concerns as well but feel the EC system is superior.

But, sometimes, the other protocols is better than HTTP(S) anyways.)<p>I think it is fine to have them implemented in separate programs, although sometimes you might want to display the result in the browser; one possibility is that the user can configure a program to execute and can configure it to treat the data that program writes to stdout as a HTTP response (possibly with different permissions than normal; it might allow some things that are normally disallowed, and some things that are normally allowed might not work). You might then also want to support other MIME types. You can do this also with external programs; so one configuration option could be to allow treating the program as a filter to convert it into a format the browser understands (e.g. plain text, HTML, PNG, etc; perhaps farbfeld should be supported too, even only for the purpose of these external filters)."

If you want the truth here it is. Tesla has installed millions of defective amphenol connectors all over the u.s. These connectors are catching fire and burning down homes and businesses. They are hiding it with something called project titan where they are hiring thousands of people just to replace connectors. The problem is that they are testing it with infrared cameras to see if the connector heats up and only then replacing it. These connectors are defective meaning just because it passes one day it does not mean it wont fail the next even after testing. Tesla refuses to replace all of these connectors betting on insurance to cover any fires and only looking at homes when their monitoring platform reports arc faults. This is why they are dismantling the solar division with layoffs. Right now if you have tesla installed on your roof you may have a ticking time bomb ready to kill you in your sleep. If you have it on your business same thing. Don&#x27;t believe me, google walmart fires. If you have tesla stock better prepare to sell it because when this gets out it is going to crash. They need to do the right thing and shut off all systems with these connectors and replace them with mc4. They wont because it would cost them hundreds of millions to do and hundreds of thousands of dollars on lost production. Do the right thing Tesla.&quot;"

"Oh man. Another diatribe from Martin Fowler™.<p>Takes me back to the 90&#x27;s when I was in awe of teh architectures and architects, understanding of which was always just beyond my grasp.<p>99% of software I&#x27;ve encountered has some kind of interface, a domain it operates in, and data it operates on. Call these three things layers. It also has some cross-cutting things that are universally available in the software - broadly, security, comms and exception management.<p>You deploy these things on desktops, phones, and devices. Other parts of the things live on servers or on clusters, mabe. Call these places (hardware) tiers.<p>There. Architecture done. From micro services to huge banking monoliths. Start there.

"These sorts of statements always scare me a bit. First,  businesses are still required to give maximum benefit to shareholders.<p>Second, even if this was the goal of a business, it then leaves it up to businesses(boards?, CEOs?) to define things like &quot;ethically&quot;, &quot;important benefits&quot;, &quot;diversity&quot; etc. These aren&#x27;t things you could get all people to agree on in the first place- hence the whole democracy thing we do. A lot easier to make these statements then turn them into policies.<p>Let businesses do what they do best - give them a set of constraints (laws) and let them maximize value.

Keep the spread.<p>This works as long as there are lots of customers who will pay a premium for short term flexibility.

"I think this is a great idea that is two decades too late. Many people say that python killed perl, and that is true for those who disliked perl. However, I think perl 6 killed perl for those who liked it, or could have liked it if they learned it. The knowledge that there was a new version on the way that would have all power of perl, but fixed many of its problems took the wind out of perl&#x27;s sail, especially once it became clear how different it was going to be. Why invest time into learning perl 5, when perl 6 was just around the corner? How do I defend my use of perl 5 in production, when its own creators have moved on? Best to just concede the battle, and regroup for the war when perl 6 is ready ... and then it never was.<p>I really think that both languages would be stronger today if Larry Wall et. al. had &quot;marketed&quot; perl 6 as a research sandbox for new ideas for language design, and then depending on where those ideas led them, pronounced it as either a successor to perl, or a new language when it was closer to ready."

I would like to understand the science behind how bacteria can live under the 50 gigapascals of pressure that one would find in the base of a skyscraper.<p>My intuitions currently tell me that finding life underneath such mechanical stress is comparable to finding life inside the lava of a volcano or on the surface of the sun.

"This article seems to only cover the residential distribution system. I say that, because it covers the single phase, center-tapped 240V (120V-Neutral-120) that&#x27;s conventional in North American residential circuits. However, in commercial buildings, I&#x27;ve seldom seen single phase 240&#x2F;120V service from the utility. Rather, I&#x27;ve seen 3-phase 480&#x2F;277V. If 208&#x2F;120V is to be used, there&#x27;s usually another transformer on premise to step down the voltages.<p>I wish the article covered how the secondaries for commercial distribution was done as well, but at least its coverage of residential service is informative."
"Sounds like this PCR software should be structured around letting the operator enter information almost as freeform as possible, basically collecting timestamped notes that are reviewed and formalized afterward.<p>UI up front can be very fast capture, with asynch layer to parse and formalize constructs, with a third stage of prefilling the final form (if paper layout needs to be maintained etc) and allowing very flexible revision.<p>Last step would be archiving locally and then transmitting to whatever outside system."
"Most comments here are &quot;remote work is great, but&quot;... That&#x27;s ignoring the inevitability of technologies. This time it&#x27;s different. Working from home was the norm for centuries, then the industrial revolution happened, and then the internet happened. Nowadays, way too many people don&#x27;t work from home, <i>for no good reason</i>. As software keeps on eating everything, remote work will cause major disruptions in the way we live, the places we live and our lifestyles. For those of us that learned to work remotely, it is an irreversible change (and polls show that too). Lifestyle adapts to work, not the other way around. As such, we should be thinking about ways in which societies and lifestyles will switch from the 9-5&#x2F;mon-fri, to something that is very asynchronous yet vibrant and fulfilling. Going back to the office just a dumb desperate solution, considering you are adding back commute time, office politics, useless distractions etc etc. Communication tools are already too good to be ignored. (Also, remote work is an onramp to freelancing&#x2F;consulting&#x2F;whatever. Because, if you can work remotely for one employer, why not work for another?)<p>Most of the complaints such as isolation and disconnection are because <i>society has not adapted to remote working</i> rather than the merits of RW itself. Imagine a world where everyone whose job allows it works remotely. That &#x27;s basically the majority of workers[1]. Imagine the change in the pace of life and thousands of people feeling as lonely as you. The precipitous fall of real estate prices as commercial properties become vacant. The empty roads that don&#x27;t need more than one lane. PEople reconnecting with their neighbors by spending a lot more time in physical proximity. Preschools and even schools becoming obsolete and replaced with home&#x2F;small group schooling. Our current lifestyles are hostile to remote work. We don&#x27;t want to return to the closed societies of small villages, but we also want to make working at home humane. We should be able to work on this problem and i look forward to the things that people will invent in the next few years.

"On the one hand, I totally get the business explanation he gave in the second half of this post. That&#x27;s a perfectly fine reason and if this is how he makes his business run for all these years, that is impressive and more power to him.<p>On the <i>other</i> hand, he should have led with that, and probably also kept it to that. Because defending this style as if it&#x27;s somehow a valid choice design-wise ... yeah no. It&#x27;s pretty obvious that the guy has no sense about design, colour use, or the aesthetic aspects that make retro look &quot;cool&quot;, how they differ from the aesthetic aspects in old games with good art versus those with bad art, and how to make choices and combine that knowledge to actually celebrate the look of retro art that he loves so much.<p>Saying it looks like this because he likes the look of retro art, is kind of dismissive of .. well basically studying graphics design in general. Because he somehow equates not spending the effort on making it look good, to the aesthetic of these old games. But a lot of effort <i>was</i> spent to make them look good within the limitations of those machines&#x2F;displays.<p>Just applying those limitations isn&#x27;t going to get you the quality. It&#x27;s just like those furniture stores that sell vintage-looking stuff, that is actually just things made badly (crooked) with artificially aged wood, pretending to be a porch on a beach house, I dunno. It wants to be vintage cool, but it turns out to be vintage crap.<p>But I get it for the business reasons. I just hate it when people come up with the excuse of &quot;actually I think it&#x27;s prettier this way&quot; ..."
"People have asked for evidence on this thread, so let me share my experience. A couple of years ago, I was developing an E-Commerce platformm internally for my company. I follow Martin Fowlers&#x27; articles on using DDD (Domain Driven Design) and Microservices to architect applications. What should have been a month long project took us 8 months! I&#x27;m not including the time I took to read about, understand and practice DDD and the surrounding concepts. Every DDD book is atleast 500 pages or more. And none of them are clear on the concepts, and are mostly full of fluff.<p>To give you more details, our stack was based on Phoenix, but it used a concept called Umbrella applications (basically Micro services pattern). Along the way, I hit so many snags and I thought I must be doing it wrong. Because, that&#x27;s what these authors kept saying all the time to people who had failed to implement their preachings. So, I met a couple of people who had actually done this DDD on a much larger scale than I had and even they shared the same experience and stories of failure and struggling. Still, I shrugged them off thinking it must be something we were doing wrong instead of DDD&#x2F;Fowler&#x27;s teachings itself. In the meantime, we were struggling to launch features for our E-Commerce software because our microservices architecture based on DDD was just a house of cards at this point. And then, I finally called up someone I knew who had done DDD successfully and asked him how he did it. He said one of the authors of a popular DDD related website, had offered to consult for his company. And they had no choice but to employ him because they were pretty invested at this point. After a while, I started meeting a bunch of such companies who got their DDD setup done by either authors or by some vendor these authors had a stake in.<p>And then BINGO, it all made sense - most of these patterns&#x2F;shortcuts&#x2F;discoveries&#x2F;secret sauces by these authors are hardly tested by them. It&#x27;s just a way to sell you more consulting and training.<p>A couple of weeks later, we hosted a casual meetup for tech talks in our area and we got to meet more folks who had followed the same path and failed. We finally decided to do a small hackathon over a weekend and get our projects done. In the end, in about 3 days from Fri-Sun, we had got done so much more with a monolithic architecture than we had ever gotten done with DDD and microservices. Today, my platform is in production and is a proud monolithic app and still going strong.<p>It was perhaps the most expensive lesson I&#x27;ve ever learnt, but one that I will remember for a long time."
"Good to see, at the end of the article, that there are people thinking about different voltages and more sophisticated systems for transforming voltages.  Now that so many devices are capable of running at quite low power it might be worth using USB-C alongside the usual power outlets for more than just computers."
The next step would be to create robot to consume the automatically created website. I hope the project fails miserably.

"&gt; This is true in practice because enough real-world C code has “I know what I’m doing” casting away of const.<p>I found this out the hard way when I implemented OptimumC, the first data flow analysis optimizer for DOS C compilers back in the 1980&#x27;s.<p>I had to undo doing optimizations on const.<p>Anecdote: Optimum C blew away all the other C compilers on a magazine benchmark article because it figured out that the benchmark code did nothing and deleted it. The author didn&#x27;t ask me about it, he just assumed the compiler was buggy and gave us a bad review. Sigh.<p>When other compilers did DFA, the benchmarks got changed."
"I can sorta agree; a database with tables and folders would be a much more useful basis for an operating system. After all, most programs will read and parse small configuration files. With a database it becomes necessary.<p>Windows sorta does that with the Registry but A) the registry isn&#x27;t the filesystem, B) the registry is a filesystem on top of NTFS and C) the registry sucks.<p>If the Registry had the power of,say, PostgreSQL to back it up, it would suck a lot less. Of course, for large files, you should still be able to rely on more conventional filesystems as well as for backwards compat."
"My opinion: this is an idiotic thing to do. I got triggered in a huge way by this for a number of reasons:<p>1. An attacker skilled enough to perform black box binary fuzzing, and create a testing harnass. Will only be minimally hindered by anything less than full blown obfuscation.<p>2. This approach aims to &#x27;fix&#x27; the problem of someone looking and testing your code, it&#x27;s hiding (not fixing!) a symptom of the problem: you wrote vulnerable code. Why not spend this effort on improving existing and actually helpfull mitigations such as dep, aslr, re-linking and pledge systems? Even better, why not re-write error prone or complex code in a safe language?!<p>2.1. This is security through obscurity, the vulnerable code is still there, someone will find it.<p>3. End users will be inconvenienced because obfuscation implies inefficient code.<p>4. This widens the gap between white hat research (not funded, often done for reputation) and black hat research which is worth good money for a quality exploit and therefore more sustainable for researchers making it their day job."

"I was given almost the opposite advice by a math teacher. Considering that speed was very important during exams, he urged us to spend no time with pretty calligraphy or presentation when turning in papers. Basically anything that could be read was good, but we needed to be fast. For example, if I&#x27;d turned in a paper with underlined text where the line is interrupted to avoid crossing the descenders of p&#x27;s and g&#x27;s, I&#x27;d probably have been told that it would be a good idea to let the flourishes go and be faster, since there were no points awarded for presentation.

"Such a stupid application of technology. It looks as if learning is completely out of fashion nowadays.<p>First of all, complaining about minorities getting lower grades because their English is not as sophisticated as that of others is the inversion of the idea of teaching. That feedback is actually great. We have machines that can give that feedback (e.g., grammarly)? Then use it to make everyone&#x27;s writing better. Grades are just a measure of the success of learning, after all. I never got why one would not allow a student to repeat a particular test as often as they like, tbh.<p>Second, grading essays this way is a clear violation of the idea of teaching. <i>What</i> do you want the students to learn? Structure? Knowledge transfer? Grammar? Writing an essay is such a complex task it is a really too broad goal. And then naturally grading becomes quite difficult."

"I agree on all major points but one: I genuinely enjoyed Shadow of the Comet. Then again, I&#x27;ve also played CoC in campaigns based on that adventure. Never ran it yet as a Keeper, though. Alone in the Dark, Lovecraftian as it might be, definitely represents several turning points in my life. The turn to an appreciation of slow horror, of appreciating the safety of real isolation. And while he&#x27;s mostly demonized, I have to thank the boss at Infogrames who insisted that Alone in the Dark run on a 286. I didn&#x27;t have a 386 or a 486 when it came out. AitD was my first brush with 3d, and while it did send me back to 2d for a long while just out of mortal terror, I&#x27;ve come around realized that like all art forms, there&#x27;s a time and place for both in the world."
"Just some observations:<p>- In my country, Lithuania, tick-born diseases have been increasingly becoming a major problem. We had them for some time, but I think the problem has been amplified by the climate change in the last few decades. At least, the summers got hotter and the winters certainly start later than they used to in my childhood.<p>- Ironically, cleaner environment and stricter EU regulations on the use of pesticides and other chemical compounds also played a role: tick population is flourishing. The government doesn&#x27;t have or at least cannot come up with some means to control it. Spraying forests with some chemical compounds would certainly produce serious side effects and would do more harm than good (unless something new gets invented). There have been some discussions in the parliament to raise the issue at the EU level.<p>- There are essentially two main diseases: tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) and Lyme disease. They are both very nasty. There is a vaccine from TBE. Unfortunately, vaccination is not universally funded or compensated by the government. Only for certain groups (forest rangers, members of the armed forces, etc). Nevertheless, a lot of people
(including myself) get vaccinated and it&#x27;s one of the most popular vaccines.<p>- Apparently, there is also a vaccine from the Lyme disease: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Lyme_disease#Vaccination"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Lyme_disease#Vaccination</a> .  In 2000s, it was tried in the US, but then subsequently pulled out from the market. It is unclear whether the vaccine really had side effects or it was due to anti-vaxxers.<p>IMO, more effort should be put on: 1) large scale vaccination 2) research on possibilities to control the tick populations."

"The electoral college achieves one very useful function thats ignored by everyone calling for its abolition in favour of the popular vote: it produces a clear winner and contains the contagion of litigating and delegitimizing the outcome of an election.<p>Think about this: there are a number of elections that have a very small popular vote margin. What if this gets less than, say, 20,000? That&#x27;s entirely possible. In a strictly popular vote election, what&#x27;s to stop each side from scrounging up votes or invalidating votes in every county in the country?<p>The most contentious and litigated election is probably the 2000 election. The electoral college contained those shenanigans to Florida alone (and largely to Miami-Dade and Broward countries, specifically).<p>There are four main problems with the US election system as I see it:<p>1. Voting needs to be mandatory. Americans who love &quot;freedom&quot; chafe against this but optional voting undermines democracy. You can see this in the organized efforts to suppress voting and disqualify voters by US political parties.<p>2. The US needs preferential voting. Third-party votes are otherwise largely a waste.<p>3. Paper ballots with optical recognition only. No punch cards, certainly no electronic voting. You need the paper trail of actual ballots. This could be filling in a ballot and validating it with a machine or using a machine to print out a ballot. These have an exceptionally low error rate.<p>4. Stop politicizing the election process. Like, why is the supervisor for elections an elected political position? This is the case in Florida, for example. Likewise, you have the Senate majority holding up election reform because of there is suspicion this will help the Democrats in the House who passed it. Seriously, Mitch McConnell needs to go to jail.<p>5. I&#x27;m fine with states being represented in the US system. The problem is that this system was designed at a time when populations were rural and cities were small. I don&#x27;t think anyone predicted the disparity between ~40M people in California and ~150k people in Vermont having 2 Senators each.<p>You&#x27;ll note that none of these are having the popular vote. IMHO that&#x27;s fixing the wrong problem."

"I&#x27;m quite confused my Tensil, is the training of the model moved to their chips, or the final model? If the former, then are the chips locked in to whatever model they were built for, e.g. this chip only trains a multi-layer perceptron with n layers? Or are the chips re-programmable or FPGAs? If the latter, don&#x27;t most models run quite quickly on CPU after training anyways?"

"Ha!  Stephen Dolan had to add this to jq quite sometime back, making it preserve object key input order on output.  And yes, it&#x27;s infuriating, but it&#x27;s also somewhat convenient, and yes, there really is software out there that cares about object key order (sigh)."
"Of these frameworks, Pyramid is the only one I know of that uses the concept of traversal. Traversal is an elegant way to tame big projects. Whenever I look at a web framework, I look for traversal and I&#x27;m always a little disappointed to see it&#x27;s missing.<p>Traversal means the framework treats each path segment in the URL as a possible branch in a tree of resources provided by the app. After completing traversal, the framework looks up a context-dependent view and checks a contextual access control list before calling the view. It feels right to declare security restrictions and other conditions outside the view."
"Functional programming was a fad and it&#x27;s going out of fashion (again).<p>It gives you rerefential transparency at the expense of  real modularity.<p>Real modularity can only be achieved through proper separation of concerns. The best way to achieve that is by categorizing system state and system logic and allowing chunks of logic to be colocated with the relevant parts of the system state. This is what OOP excels at.<p>With functional programming, you cannot colocate module logic with module state so you often end up with a large monolithic state store on one side of the system and logic which is completely decoupled and sitting on the opposite side of the system... Then the challenge is to apply functions to various relevant parts of the state to transform it in a referentially transparent way.<p>The modularity problem then comes when you need to make a change to the schema&#x2F;structure of the state; whenever you change the structure of the state, you need you need to search through your logic to identify all the parts of the logic which depend on that state and update them to work with the new structure. This is a massive problem and leads to what OOP developers call spaghetti code."
This is super cool! Amazing work.

Fortunately we&#x27;re targeting the web, so I really only have to worry about two push provider implementations: APNs and VAPID. I really hope Apple agrees to implement VAPID sooner than later so developers can stop wasting their time.<p>We have used OneSignal in the past, but there&#x27;s something so satisfying about delivering the notification yourself. Also, a word of caution for people new to push notifications: we discovered early on that sending a million push notifications all at once is a really good way of crashing your site, as they have a surprisingly high click through rate in the first minute of sending!"

"&gt; Infectious diseases have always been one of the major causes of child deaths, but the success of vaccination campaigns and antibiotic availability has done a great deal to reduce mortality from infectious diseases. Measles vaccination is a perfect example: the number of measles cases has shrunk by 86% since 1990. The WHO has estimated that <i>between 2000 and 2017 measles vaccination has prevented 21.1 million deaths across Africa.</i><p>&gt; Today we also have vaccines available for tuberculosis, meningitis, hepatitis, and whooping cough.

"&quot;Theft of trade secrets&quot; is how Silicon Valley was built.<p>Fairchild was &quot;theft of trade secrets&quot; from Shockley; Intel was &quot;theft of trade secrets&quot; from Fairchild.  When Camenzind left Signetics and designed the 555 (under contract to Signetics), he was &quot;using trade secrets&quot; of Signetics; in today&#x27;s legal environment, they could have just ordered him to stick around as an employee and work on a less risky project.  MOSTek was built out of &quot;trade secrets&quot; of Motorola.  Unix was only released under a source licensing agreement, and for decades the Lions book, the bible for Unix kernel engineering, was illegal and could not be printed legally, because it contained &quot;trade secrets&quot; (and copyrighted code!) of AT&amp;T.  (Or, rather, Western Electric.)  Indeed, economists have published a number of papers arguing that that California&#x27;s prohibitions on non-compete agreements and on employer ownership of private work product underpinned the 1970s–1990s shift from Boston to Silicon Valley.<p>So this movement toward resolving such conflicts in the courts, instead of by companies competing to out-innovate one another, is very troubling.  Investors, and in this case Google upper management, are killing the goose that laid the golden egg; they want to shift power from engineers, who make things, to lawyers and investors, who specialize in getting paid for them.<p>This is probably a major factor in the widely-observed shift of the center of innovation from Silicon Valley to Shenzhen, where shanzhai (&quot;theft of trade secrets&quot;) is a way of life.<p>I live in a poor country which is poor mostly because the established economic powers are able to strangle new centers of wealth creation in the cradle, using the government and laws.

"I have similar but slightly different issues with my 2018 3-series BMW. For most things, I think the BMW apps are actually better than what you get from CarPlay. For example, the BMW GPS makes better use of screen real estate. (On the other hand, Apple seems to do a better job of accounting for traffic in route planning.)<p>The one puzzling omission from the BMW software is support for podcasts. For that, CarPlay is the only usable solution.<p>One major irritant is connecting and disconnecting. This is especially bad when there are multiple iPhones in the car. (I know, what are the odds, amirite?) I had my iPhone plugged in via USB, and playing music. My wife was using her iPhone, which the car decided to connect to CarPlay. And certain actions on her phone somehow confused the iDrive system to stop playing music and bring up her iPhone on the display.<p>I wish that car manufacturers would either get it right, or turn the whole thing over to Apple. These intermediate solutions just suck."

Even if you can&#x27;t fly to Google HQ, continue to think outside the box.  Some ideas include Hire someone at taskrabbit or Craigslist, or a FB jobs page, to go to their front desk, or if unsuccessful, to hold a sign on public property in front of Google&#x27;s HQ, you can get a banner or sign professionally made (online process are pretty reasonably priced).

"Shrug - I&#x27;ve seen the other side of this.<p>The key point to remember is that college newspapers are generally not independent. It even mentions it in the article. Campus newspapers are funded by the college. It&#x27;s also college staff who serve as the mentors&#x2F;oversight, the college provides the space, offices, printing facilities, and equipment. The newspaper may use the college name, motto, crest, or other identifying information. Students may even earn course credit, so there is overhead with academic reports, metrics, and associated staff.<p>When campus newspapers are pressured by the college, it&#x27;s not a first amendment issue. Just like HN has the legal right to moderate it&#x27;s forum, so does the administration have the right to moderate a campus newspaper.<p>None of this matters if they are reporting on what&#x27;s for for lunch, but what about when the paper starts to report on more sensitive issues? Topics like sexual assault, criminal activity, HR actions, etc. all carry significant liability and risk. Are they newsworthy, maybe, but even large institutional papers like the Washington Post or the New York Times makes mistakes on what or how something is reported. And, when one of those big institutional papers does get something wrong, they can be sued. Bad&#x2F;irresponsible reporting has serious consequences both for the institution and the individuals involved.<p>Colleges treat campus papers as a learning opportunity. That said, If you screw up a coding assignment, it&#x27;s a learning moment that doesn&#x27;t really have any external impact. Journalism by definition has an external impact, and of course a college is going to be more risk adverse.<p>Im all for a robust and well executed campus newspaper, but if they want to be independent, they should be run as independent institutions with their own funding and resources.<p>I know it rubbed the student the wrong way, but ... welcome to the real world. No one is stopping the reporting of news. Anyone can fire up a blog, website or a podcast.  Surprise, people don&#x27;t like paying for things that make them look bad, or are potentially risky endeavors with little upside."

"anecdotal evidence ahead ...<p>I wanted to be a data scientist at a top tech company, so I did as Hanif did, and went to the data on LinkedIn.  my search was more specific - only data scientists at top tech firms, and is also a very tiny sample.<p>But first, my situation at the time:
Masters in Computer Science at the University of Pennsylvania.  strong database, AWS, spark, and python skills.  worked in a social media research lab that looked social media impacts on health, mostly did NLP involving twitter and health outcome data.  Coauthored a paper that ended up in JAMA (journal of american medical association).  Eventually I got what I wanted, but it wasn&#x27;t easy.<p>TLDNR:<p>- message recruiters directly<p>- find a way of showing them you are a good candidate beyond your resume - I found kaggle was really helpful, I recommend it.<p>- be careful of getting pigeonholed out of DS positions by recruiters.  your LinkedIn should speak &#x27;I am a data scientist at heart&#x27;<p>- be prepared to fail interviews and learn from mistakes<p>- study stats (youtube,books), coding (leet code), and SQL (leet code?)<p>Findings:
Degree - Need masters or PHD.  
Major - Statistics or some version of it was most common and MBA&#x27;s at top MBA programs 2nd, Computer Science very rare.  why MBAs? probably because those programs had wonderful stats programs.
School - Top schools are very important.
previous job - Intern at a top tech company.  Intern as a data scientist hugely beneficial.  Next most important feature was whether the previous positions was data scientist.  Not data backed, but I would argue that becoming a data engineer to get adjacent skills is a bad strategy.  DE are highly needed, a recruiter will put you on DE loops, not DS ones.  I feel like data analysts also struggle to become DS.<p>I thought my situation was at least somewhat ideal, but I was not getting interviews.  0. Its hard emotionally to not be able to get to where you want without been giving a chance, just got to keep trying.  Findings helped me realize (previous job) that I was going to need to go about getting interviews in a more efficient manner.<p>I needed a way of getting attention.  the reply rate of websites seems to be 1&#x2F;50, which is problematic if you want to work for a specific set of companies.  I think the best thing to do is to go on LinkedIn, search &lt;company name&gt; + recruiter.  Message the recruiters directly, they have all the power in setting up phone screens, and they send batches of candidates to open positions hoping some of them will get a role.  Now you got their attention, so you also need a way of getting into those batches.<p>An important metric for success was already being what I wanted, so I had to find a way of saying &#x27;I can do this&#x27;.  I starting spending most of my free time on kaggle, the zillow home price prediction.  I finished top 100, which I STRONGLY feel this helped me get interviews.  I recommend it.  Its a free, zero risk way to get experience and display your passion&#x2F;skills.<p>Next, I got some phone screens but failed a few and failed an on site.  Technical phone screens are either stats, coding, or SQL - never been asked ML questions.  Sometimes I failed coding questions, sometimes I failed stat questions.  I addressed this by studying lots of stats (YouTube was very helpful) and coding (leet code).  I already had years of SQL experience, so those questions were always easy for me but be prepared to answer the histogram question.  I had some recruiters tell me in initial phone screen &#x27;even though you applied to a data science position, we think you would be a better match for this data engineering position instead&#x27;.  ouch, I realized my LinkedIn and resume looked very DE like because of my years as a database administrator and I added lots of spark&#x2F;HIVE to my resume because I saw that on most DS postings.  Its important, but don&#x27;t over highlight the wrong things.  I politely declined and kept trying.<p>Eventually I got exactly what I wanted, and I am very happy for it.  It took me 2 years after graduation to get there, and I had failures at all parts of the process.  I know it sounds cliche, but keep trying is my best advice."

"While I&#x27;m sure that buried in the TOS you can be banned at any time for any reason, and the sheer volume of apps they referee makes things difficult to have humans manage. The &quot;right&quot; thing to do here would be to at least provide some sort of substantiation of your assertion that it violates policy.<p>-App is asking for more permissions than it needs
-App is violating privacy 
-App is direct copy of&#x2F; mimicking Core OS functionality
-App is using non opensource code<p>etc.<p>They obfuscation of the reasons for the ban seem to me to be one of the following
1) laziness
2) malice
3) fear that it would somehow expose the methodology for finding the policy violations and create a cat and mouse game.<p>It seems like mobile development is becoming less and less an attractive platform to spend my cycles.

Parsing is a minefield in general, but parsing JSON is one of the easiest tasks of all serialization formats. 
It&#x27;s also the only secure format.<p>Its various spec bugs (by omission) are not that dramatic, and the various &quot;enhancements&quot; only made it worse, ie more insecure. Still, bad but not a minefield. What worries me most that my JSON module is the defacto perl standard, passes all these tests, was the very first to add all these tests, is the fastest, and still is not included in that list, just some outdated modules which should not be used at all.

But I think we need at least support for this &quot;shapes&quot; of data: List, Tables, Trees and maybe graphs<p>- I think will be nice to have an equivalent of Request&#x2F;responses alike http. And then a way to introspect what a command do, like auto-swagger.<p>- Having widgets like table-browser, graphs, etc AS COMPONENTS.<p>In FoxPro you could say &quot;browse&quot; and it display a DataTable grid with full editing capabilities on the current table (or it ask for a table to open). In this case:<p><pre><code>    ls | ui_browse

It happens everywhere, the biggest pet peeve of mine is that it&#x27;s a normal, accepted practice. For instance, if you don&#x27;t like your boss, you don&#x27;t say anything, you just hold it in and then you send in your resignation.

"Agreed. I recently went from multiple years of Linux to OSX, and I find OSX FINE. Not great. Not revolutionary. Just fine.  I can install emacs and it works. Whoopie.<p>The laptop is fine.

I have my Ipad set up with a terminal app and an ssh key that lets me remote in. BOOM. My hoss machine at home with a great internet connection at my fingertips. Totally portable dev environment.<p>On top of THAT, the iPad UX is very tolerable. And having a detached screen with no keyboard is great. I can access Oreilly online learning, Kindle, and Dropbox and read whenever I feel like it ( which I have done a LOT ).<p>Heck, this whole summer I have been sitting out on my deck reading books, watching Youtube, using Steam Link on my gaming PC, hacking on my dev box, and pretty much EVERYTHING else on that little iPad.<p>Combo that with the new Sidecar feature coming with the next version of iOS, and I&#x27;m thinking I am going to upgrade to an iPad pro.

Yes please.<p>The only downsides: iOS native games are few and far between. One of the top recommendations is FTL, a game released in 2012. If they could get Magic the Gathering: Arena, Hades ( Supergiant Games ), Into the Breach, and a regular cadence of good indie titles on there, I would marry the thing.<p>The other downside: The walled garden means they keep emulators and implementation for the Switch pro controller out of the app store.

"OK, so my theory on that is that it was all Jony Ive fault. Back in the days when Jobs was still around he was a natural counter balance to Ive. He wanted everything to be not only &#x27;beautiful&#x27; but most notably just working. Ive was great source of new design ideas for him and he was usually throwing away bad ones (from technical point of view) and leaving the god ones (of course there was some mistakes but over all it was working just fine).<p>At some point Ive became to have major role in making decisions of what&#x27;s going in to production. Jobs had serious health issues, couldn&#x27;t keep his eye on everything and finally he passed away which made Jony the guy who was making decisions pretty much on his own. I bet that trashcan MacPro, butterfly keyboards, &quot;thinness war&quot;, sticking for too long to one design etc., those are all his ideas that he pushed trough.<p>Quite recently Apple realized that leaving everything in Ives hands is not that good idea after all and I have a feeling that redesigned MacPro and decision to ditch butterfly keyboards from newest MBPs was forced on Ive and that&#x27;s the real reason behind him becoming external contractor for Apple. They couldn&#x27;t fire him completely but they needed changes and Jony didn&#x27;t liked restrictions on his design choices so they&#x27;ve split.<p>As for the future, we already saw that story in the past and as we know history like to repeat itself. In the next 2-3 years Apple products will become more in line of what users wants. They finally started to listen to people and it will result with better products, at least in short term. Times has changed and I hope that history will not repeat itself in the next step when, like in the 90s, Apple will become shadow of it&#x27;s former self, trying to build products based on financial statistics and polls and not on engineering and design talent of their employees. After all we think we know what we want but in reality there will be products and solutions that we can&#x27;t imagine right know and no amount of polls will give the answer to a question what&#x27;s next, what&#x27;s behind the horizon."

"On a semi-related note, I occasionally look at the news items Google news suggests for me, and these include a significant portion of climate change denialists propaganda, including one shocked, shocked by Nature &quot;suppressing academic freedom with this list&quot; (and my searches are never <i>for</i> climate denialism).<p>Which is to say, these may be a few sciences but it seems like they significant resources behind them, somehow."

"Great write-up, concise enough but not too dry.<p>I generally agree with dropdowns being overused, but this seems too much to me:<p>&gt; Picking a date from dropdowns is the worst. If I ever do this, then I’ve really failed as a UX designer.<p>Really? On a laptop, native dropdowns use keyboard input as search, so using tab (granted, not everyone knows this) I can generally enter my age almost as if I was writing it.<p>On mobile, scrolling through the iOS dropdown control is fine, more comfortable than typing. Scrolling 30 options back to enter my age is the worst part, and getting worse every year, but it isn&#x27;t that bad."

"Funny how RSS managed to take off originally by focusing on discoverability (education about meta tags, the infamous orange “broadcasting” icon, etc.) and these days it’s still plagued by lack of discoverability or misunderstandings as to its use and reach.<p>All the blogs&#x2F;sites I ran&#x2F;run&#x2F;manage have RSS feeds, and I still sift through roughly a thousand items a day over breakfast using Reeder and Feedly. RSS is very far from dead - it’s just not a common enough use case to be the default way for non-technical (or, rather, “non-motivated”) people to read their news and other info.<p>When you have the motivation and interest in following specific topics or sites, it’s not that much of a landing curve to pick out an aggregator (Feedly seems to be the most popular).<p>I’d say that RSS is in extensive use by humans, and that most shortcomings in comments up to now have fairly trivial workarounds (like truncated feeds, which can trivially be worked around by a client like Reeder, which can fetch the original homepage and render it in a format similar to “reading mode”).<p>In general, I think RSS has tremendous return if you a) pick your sources carefully and b) spend a bit of time figuring out how to get a good UX."

"&gt; “You’ve got a guy shooting heroin on the street, and the cop is supposed to say, ‘You O.K.?’” grumbled one law enforcement officer in Seattle.<p>As progressive as some are here, the NIMBYism (see other locals that this opinion piece has riled up in the thread) and bad apples on the police force spoiling the whole bunch are just as bad as anywhere else.<p>Another anecdote to add to the quote: walking up 12th Ave (Cap Hill) midday on a Sunday, some friends and I passed by a dude sleeping or passed out on the sidewalk and two oncoming walking cops simultaneously. One looked down and asked, &quot;rough night?&quot; and laughed with his partner.<p>In case it&#x27;s not clear, this wasn&#x27;t a friendly offer of assistance, this was a drive by insult (they didn&#x27;t break stride at all) that made it clear that if it weren&#x27;t for progressive laws about occupying public space they&#x27;d be violently removing the guy from the sidewalk."

"From the other side - if the world is on fire but a portion of the population thinks everything is just fine and dandy... is it appropriate for everyone to be politely quite until that portion comes to their own realization that the world is on fire?  What if that never happens?<p>I feel like the gun control debate is particularly relevant - whenever a shooting happens one side calmly says &quot;This is unfortunate but unavoidable given the cost to freedom we&#x27;d need to pay to remove firearms - please stop trying to use a tragedy politically&quot; while the other side says &quot;How many times does this need to happen before you realize 12,000 Americans died from this last year and I don&#x27;t want my kid to be one of them.&quot;<p>Here&#x27;s an issue where I think half the side thinks the world is on fire and the other is content - without getting into the merits of either side I do think it&#x27;s unreasonable for the anti-gun control side to continue to argue against having a discussion for the sake of decorum.  This is a divide we need to resolve."
I don&#x27;t smoke or vape. I think the world is way better off vaping than smoking. I certainly do hope whatever caused this is discovered. I would hate to see more cigarettes light up again.<p>I&#x27;m guessing (and hoping) that more regulation will come down on the vaping industry to make sure whatever oils or additives are controlled so that we can prevent this from happening with future additives they discover.
"I know this is a controversial opinion and I know it won’t directly solve the issue at hand, but it’s related and it addresses some of the concerns raised by many people in this thread: how do we get open source the funding it needs?<p>Consider a world where the norm is not MIT&#x2F;BSD but GPL dual licensed with MIT for a fee. This would give back control to maintainers of a library, and it would allow people without funds to use the software freely by contributing back to the community any changes they wish to further publish.<p>It puts the incentives in the right place, which is very important for a scalable, sustainable solution and to avoid tragedy of the commons!<p>It’s controversial because licensing has become a tribal issue, frustrating level headed debate. But I would argue that many people choose MIT without really thinking it through, “because it’s how everyone else does it”. You can see this in complaints from maintainers of code released under MIT, abuse which would never have been possible with the GPL.<p>I really think there is value in evaluating the community’s obsession with MIT, before we jump to pointing fingers at “companies”. Remember: if you get burned by the tragedy of the commons, ask yourself why did we set ourselves up to fail? It’s the hardest possible fight to win.<p>Again I’m not trying to derail this into MIT v GPL, I’m just saying: IF we all choose MIT, can we really complain now? This is what happens: people profit off your work and don’t contribute. If you feel so frustrated by that that you’re adding ads to your lib, maybe MIT wasn’t the right choice?<p>(MIT has merit and there are people out there using it for the right reasons. But they’re not the ones putting ads in their repos.)"

"I&#x27;ve used a Mac at work for several years now and generally either like the UX or have found third-party packages to fix my problems like BetterTouchTool.<p>All but one-- MacOS doesn&#x27;t allow click-through. If you&#x27;re working in one window and want to click on something in a second window, you need to click twice, once to select the other window and then again to do whatever you were looking to do. This drives me crazy on an hourly basis and there is no way to fix it."
"I&#x27;ve seen there are plenty of comments that disagree with that statement. I agree, though.<p>I love working remotely. I&#x27;ve been working remotely for a bit less than a year now. I had some few months break at the beginning of this year where I was working on my own product, but I was still at home.<p>Why do I love it? Well, my wife is staying at home with me and we get to spend so much more time together. I think over that period of time we&#x27;ve got closer together. We can chat during the day, eat meals together and stuff like that, it&#x27;s super cool.<p>More reasons? If I can work asynchronously (not being dependent on the rest of my team) I can schedule my day according to my needs. Need a one hour walk outside? Well, why not:) Even though it&#x27;s not my company I&#x27;m working for I kind feel like I am the boss. I don&#x27;t have people staring at my screen, I don&#x27;t have people talking next to me, I can go to a shop and prepare a nice breakfast if I want to. It&#x27;s really good.<p>I do agree that it gets a bit boring without a chitchat with colleagues. But I try to compensate for it by meeting with my friends and family regularly."
"Lots of speculating why it is cheaper to ship from China than domestically, a lot of it misguided.<p>The root cause is that quite a few years ago the consortium of national postal providers which setup agreements on who pays for which parts of international shipping decided that China was classed as a developing country and given subsidized rates by other countries. This wasn&#x27;t a big deal when the agreement was made because it was before the days of pervasive online commerce, and there just wasn&#x27;t that much sent from China to other countries via the postal service.<p>I encourage everyone interested in this to checkout this podcast episode from NPR&#x27;s Planet Money:

"I don&#x27;t think most people are capable of being creative all the time, but the key is to find some creative pursuit you enjoy and make sure you make time to pursue it.

"I am one of the developers of Tridactyl.<p>This dispute is because Tridactyl used to provide a function that users could choose to run that would change two of Firefox&#x27;s settings (the kind you find in about:config). Changing these settings allows addons to run on e.g. addons.mozilla.org and accounts.firefox.org where they otherwise cannot. The change we made is the same change that several blogs had already talked about and suggested.<p>Here is a relevant bugzilla thread that motivated the creation of the blacklist that we turned off, so you can see what Mozilla thinks: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bugzilla.mozilla.org&#x2F;show_bug.cgi?id=1415644"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bugzilla.mozilla.org&#x2F;show_bug.cgi?id=1415644</a><p>A mozilla employee informally asked us to remove this function for security reasons (and we did). Later, an AMO reviewer asked us to change users&#x27; Firefox config automatically to remove these settings. We would rather this were made an explicit choice for Tridactyl users and we&#x27;re trying to negotiate a compromise with the reviewer.<p>This is the only plausible route to exploitation of this situation that I know of, assuming a user acting before we removed the fixamo command:<p>1. You manually install Tridactyl<p>2. You manually install our native messenger<p>3. You manually run a command called `fixamo` or you manually find and install our exemplar RC file that explicitly says at the top that you should read and customise it because it does things you might not like; and then you don&#x27;t read or edit it<p>4. You also manually install a malicious addon<p>5. That malicious addon doesn&#x27;t have permissions for &lt;all_urls&gt; (otherwise it can steal your banking credentials without tridactyl&#x27;s help) but does have permission for accounts.firefox.org<p>6. That addon can then steal your firefox account credentials and use them to e.g. mess with your synced settings and e.g. download your passwords database (if you don&#x27;t have a master password set).<p>My view is that you&#x27;re pretty much fucked if you install a malicious addon with &lt;all_urls&gt; anyway (and many addons request that permission), so this slight extra capability you get if you successfully phish someone in this pool of &lt;1000 people isn&#x27;t a big deal.<p>---<p>Some people have opined that our documentation for the command was not explicit enough. My opinion is that it&#x27;s good enough and about on par with other resources that talked about the same settings. It would be better if it was more explicit about the security risks, but we provided fairly complete information about what we were doing and a link to the source code.<p>This is the documentation we provided:<p>In the &quot;Webextension caveats&quot; section:<p>&quot;To make Tridactyl work on addons.mozilla.org and some other Mozilla domains, you need to open about:config, run fixamo or add a new boolean privacy.resistFingerprinting.block_mozAddonManager with the value true, and remove the above domains from extensions.webextensions.restrictedDomains.&quot;<p>In the docstring for fixamo, partially displayed if you type fixamo in the commandline and also included in the help pages we encourage users to use with e.g. `:h fixamo`:<p>&quot;Simply sets<p>&quot;privacy.resistFingerprinting.block_mozAddonManager&quot;:true &quot;extensions.webextensions.restrictedDomains&quot;:&quot;&quot;<p>in about:config via user.js so that Tridactyl (and other extensions!) can be used on addons.mozilla.org and other sites.&quot;<p>You can find these messages in src&#x2F;excmds.ts at commit 92e1b005c47995e3d24f61a7d4c3935df8437f1a<p>We also included a variant of the fixamo command in the exemplar .tridactylrc file (not used unless you have also installed the native messenger and also explicitly found, downloaded and installed the exemplar). This file includes this text at the top:<p>&quot;Provided only as an example.<p>Do not install&#x2F;run without reading through as you may be surprised by some of the settings.&quot;<p>And this text right above the fixamo line:<p>&quot;Make Tridactyl work on more sites at the expense of some security&quot;"

Unfortunately I didn&#x27;t think to screenshot anything.<p>The phone was literally only a couple weeks old. Nothing new had been paired. I changed the name back and figured I would look it up later.

"I actually wrote code for the autofit. Didn&#x27;t do multiple pages, but it would adjust the size of a text to fit it into a given space (it was for printing chemical bottle labels). That was a fun project. I had a customized font set made by Bitstream for setting the Japanese text (this was years before Unicode was a viable thing, so we were encoding non-Latin scripts using SJIS) and had to go through a couple hundred pages of character tables to verify that we didn&#x27;t have any coding errors when we switched to that font from the free bitmapped font we had previously."
"It is still going to be cheaper to order directly from China then to pay someone in the US to order it, repackage it, and mail it to me. (Or even to be lazy and order it on my behalf from China, but US companies will repack it so you don&#x27;t find out their sources). The US just doesn&#x27;t have the manufacturing capabilities anymore, and even if the US wanted to have its own manufacturing capability people are not going to work China wages, they are going to demand US wages. So again China will end up being cheaper."

"Good on Twitter and Facebook.<p>On top of blocking thousands of websites (which includes Facebook, Google, Twitter) China&#x27;s government employs thousands of government employees just to purge even the most mild criticism of the CCP on Weibo [1]. They also employ tens of thousands to export their propaganda overseas, using sock puppet accounts to push their worldview[2]. And their worldview is fiercely anti-democratic.<p>The Internet cannot remain free if we allow governments to use their power to control narratives and suppress the truth.

"&gt; Raynal’s lifestyle was becoming so unbalanced that his family was beginning to worry about him. One day, he ran out of his room in a panic, telling them that all of the color had bled out of his vision. His mother bustled him off to an ophthalmologist, who told him he appeared to have disrupted the photoreceptors in his eyes by staring so long at a monitor screen. Thankfully, the condition persisted only a few hours. But then there came a day when he suddenly couldn’t understand anything that was said to him; he had apparently become so attuned to the language of computer code that he could no longer communicate with humans. That worrisome condition lasted several weeks.<p>This sounds hard to believe. A lot more people use computers nowadays, for equally long periods of time if not more, and neither of these symptoms seem to be a thing. So... what&#x27;s going on here?

"Most of us have fell down these rabbit holes of learning before; the author does a great job of illustrating the concept, showing the solving of an &quot;ultimate question&quot; about how&#x2F;why something works the way it does.<p>I don&#x27;t know if it counts the same, but I once went on a weird journey to solve a particular coding problem that I was certain was already answered. I don&#x27;t recall the details, but I do recall thinking to myself &quot;This seems like a common problem; a quick google should bring up a solution...&quot; - so, one google search later, and:<p><a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;xkcd.com&#x2F;979&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;xkcd.com&#x2F;979&#x2F;</a><p>At that point, I vowed to solve the problem - again - and post the solution (of course the fact that I can&#x27;t recall what the problem was negates me being able to show you what I mean - my apologies - sigh).<p>I quickly found that to solve the problem, I first had to learn how to code X, which in turn meant learning about Y and Z, and also coding A, B and C. I ended up going down these rabbit holes; by turns learning and coding partial solutions, by others finding example code I could adapt to my needs (not always in the language I was working with, either). I spent more than a few hours on this task, but I eventually did come up with a solution.<p>And as I recall, I did post that solution to the thread where I encountered XKCD-979 - so future people wouldn&#x27;t be inconvenienced."
"Encarta is a great example of Microsoft winning a market, and after it was defeated, letting it fade out. Wikipedia in some ways beat it, but the interactivity elements of Encarta make it something that you kind of wish had a more direct role in the modern day.<p>I wrote about this topic a few years ago (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tedium.co&#x2F;2017&#x2F;07&#x2F;13&#x2F;who-killed-the-encyclopedia&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tedium.co&#x2F;2017&#x2F;07&#x2F;13&#x2F;who-killed-the-encyclopedia&#x2F;</a>), and it led a former CEO of Encyclopaedia Britannica to speak up (I added some of his comments to the piece). There was a lot of back-room wheeling and dealing around digital encyclopedias during that era, much of it centered around Encarta—Microsoft acquired a lot of publishers during that period and it effectively disrupted most of the rest out of existence.<p>But even considering that, Encarta was special. I think Microsoft had the right idea—it was the killer app for CD-ROMs—though it turned out that the internet would only make it a temporary success story.<p>It didn’t have to be like that, honestly. Imagine what might have happened if, for example, Microsoft worked more closely with the Wikimedia Foundation on the highly visual treatments the company was known for with Encarta. The nonprofit ownership was a good move, but the fact that MS seemed to cede the market entirely, especially so soon after disrupting the whole thing, was unfortunate."
"It&#x27;s fun to feed it the first paragraph of the Sokal affair paper:<p>Prompt:<p><i>There are many natural scientists, and especially physicists, who continue to reject the notion that the disciplines concerned with social and cultural criticism can have anything to contribute, except perhaps peripherally, to their research. Still less are they receptive to the idea that the very foundations of their worldview must be revised or rebuilt in the light of such criticism. Rather, they cling to the dogma imposed by the long post-Enlightenment hegemony over the Western intellectual outlook, which can be summarized briefly as follows: that there exists an external world, whose properties are independent of any individual human being and indeed of humanity as a whole; that these properties are encoded in ``eternal&#x27;&#x27; physical laws; and that human beings can obtain reliable, albeit imperfect and tentative, knowledge of these laws by hewing to the ``objective&#x27;&#x27; procedures and epistemological strictures prescribed by the (so-called) scientific method.</i><p>Completion:<p><i>Before one can explore these ``objective&#x27;&#x27; principles and procedures, one must do something important, namely, invent the objectivity -- or, more precisely, the objectivity-transcendent properties -- of the ``subjective&#x27;&#x27; functions of ``man&quot; (as a species of &#x27;&#x27;objective&#x27;&#x27;, or something-in-itself-independent, human, being). Since the 19th century, this has been done on a literal or phenomenological level, the metanarrative of psychoanalysis. However, the ultimate test of what constitutes an objective fact or structure is the statistical discovery of reliable facts or structures residing in the human mind or body. That is what the discipline of psychology is for. The distinction between the subjective and the objective is therefore necessary for the discipline of psychological science, which is by no means a waste of time, which is today a flourishing field of scientific inquiry, and which might contribute a great deal toward furnishing a genuinely complete theoretical understanding of human behavior and psychical experience.<p>In short, the philosophical implications of the post-Enlightenment philosophy of the sciences and of psychical psychology are -- when considered in the context of both human existence and human thought -- deeply unsatisfactory. Once we abandon the most basic postulate of scientific rationality -- that subjective knowledge and belief and behavior are not to be said to be existent but to be, not to be, knowable -- there is nothing left to suggest that the content of human knowledge and experience is dependent upon our conscious perceptions or personalities. We might describe that content as ineffable (it is irreducible to language, outside the experience of individual thinkers), or inconceivable (that which is not one&#x27;s own consciousness, but is beyond the realm of conscious experience). In either case, there is no genuine need for an objective world, or, at least, no need for an objective foundation. In that sense, it is erroneous to assert that the scientific standpoint is a paradigm of objective reality; rather, it is the antidote to the paradigm of irreducible subjectivity and self-consciousness.<p>Unsupported by this analysis of the problem of scientific knowledge, the field of psychical science is often rejected by younger scholars, for whom the study of the human condition and its ineffable psychology is regarded as a particularly enticing but very unapproachable form of mysticism. They regard this section of the theory and practice of modern scientific inquiry as a kind of metaphysical theory-cracking rather than as a vehicle for the discovery of objective facts. Such a view can only be sustained on the basis of the strictest adherence to the doctrines of empiricism and fundamental materialism, respectively, and it is by no means fruitful for the real progress of science. Let me explain.<p>The residual emphasis on irreducible subjectivity in modern Western thought (and only by the residual emphasis) is a legacy of the metaphysical concept of objective reality which, to my mind, is still embraced by the cognitivist movement of the 20th century. It is an unfortunate legacy. Irreducible subjectivity and subjectivity-dependent, subjective perceptions were at the root of the metaphysics of Buddhism, and these beliefs now constitute the dominant conception of reality in contemporary Western philosophy, particularly Kantian, Descartesian, and Hegelian thought, which are each deeply indebted to Aristotelian theories of subjectivity.<p>While both these views of reality are patently absurd, and since the scientific revolutionary of the middle 19th century was able to disregard or repudiate them, the followers of Kant and Descartes were able to maintain that there is no need for a foundation for the science of knowledge. They could do this because they held to a primitive, problematic conception of objectivity, based on the notion of an objective, external world, in which human consciousness, thus independent of any particular body, mind, or culture, was inchoate, mutable, and subject to change or speculation. There was therefore no need to search for a theory of experience. Science and experience were simply different approaches, of which each was as good as the other, and they both...</i>"

"After reading all the griping on HN about Apple&#x27;s supposedly draconian independent repair policies, I was very surprised with my recent experience.<p>I phoned Apple last week to get the battery replaced in my 2011 MacBook Air, and the nice lady said that Apple won&#x27;t fix it because it&#x27;s classified as obsolete.

Even in the craptastic low-end town I live in, there were three options.  I was very surprised.<p>Brought my computer in, and the price is $180 — $130 for the battery, and $50 for the labor.  Seems about right.  When I priced the battery replacement last year (before it was &quot;obsolete&quot;), it was $130.  I guess Apple doesn&#x27;t charge for labor.<p>There was an interesting sign in the store.  It was an Apple sign, and it asked to be sure to provide the store with an e-mail address, because Apple may follow up to find out if the store&#x27;s service was up to Apple standards.  I thought that was very interesting.<p>I haven&#x27;t picked up my computer yet (the store had to order the battery).  But I&#x27;m curious to find out if I&#x27;ll get picked for my feedback."

"personally Juul is the only device that helped me quit smoking tobacco. i&#x27;ve tried other vapes and none compare to how easy it is to use a Juul, and how consistent their hits are. added bonus: i still get my nicotine, but without the rest of the cigarette chemicals (which btw, are radioactive: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.epa.gov&#x2F;radtown&#x2F;radioactivity-tobacco"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.epa.gov&#x2F;radtown&#x2F;radioactivity-tobacco</a>).<p>but this &quot;Juul targeting children&quot; thing is not new. i know they&#x27;ve been the focus of the US gov in the past, and they enacted some changes to their marketing (including removing some flavours and the like).<p>not sure what sparked this case thou, as in Europe (where i&#x27;m located) the whole tobacco industry is tightly regulated. but we can still get our nicotine without the government banning it (see San Francisco), although at a much lower strength (1.8 vs 5.0 in the states). this lower strength also helped.<p>so I hope due to this case Juul removes all this marketing BS and simply focus on their initial primary goal: making people drop tobacco and cigarettes."

"My father is from a generation where, from the day he got hired to the day he retired, 45 years later, he worked for the same employer.  That changed in the 1990s.<p>That changed in the 1990s because companies no longer valued long term commitments.  The famous example is IBM laying off, in bulk, countless long-term employees in the interest of increasing their bottom line.<p>The only way I was able to get a pay raise in the tech industry was by changing jobs.  Once I figured that out, I changed jobs about once a year to triple my salary.  On the way of doing this to climb the corporate ladder, I saw a lot of unethical behavior:<p>I saw countless dot-com startups dissolve after all of the executives gave themselves as big of a golden parachute as possible; I had consultants tell me to put experience I never did on my resume; I saw a company closing shop without paying their employees their final paycheck; I saw (and still sometimes see) hucksters promising good work and “exposure” but saying they could not pay you “for the time being”; I see companies demanding extensive experience (the infamous “ten years of React” job posting -- keep in mind React has been around for under seven years) but never offering on-the-job training; I have seen people who have developed injury or disabilities interfering with their work being “laid off” without warning; I have seen big tech companies refusing to hire anyone outright and cut off contracts short in the interest of maximizing CEO pay and shareholder value.<p>In short, I have become cynical about the tech industry and how it treats employees.  Sure, it’s a living wage, but they won’t hire you if you mention “work life balance” during the interview; they expect long hours from their employees and expect the company to become their passion or life.  No wonder why fewer people in America decide to give birth to and raise kids; it’s just not possible with the insane hours tech companies expect from their employees.<p>Yes, I’ve become quite cynical about the tech industry.  It chews up workers and spit them out.  The happiest memories of my life are not being in some cubicle in some office making too much money, but the times in my life when I took a break from tech and supported myself as an English teacher in another country, and had time to actually make real world friends and be able to date normally.  Those are the times I cherish; that and the time I spend with my beautiful daughter."

"If we want to implement a human-like intelligence, I think it’s very likely that we’ll have to emulate a lot of the environment we inhabit. To me, human culture and parts of our brain is like software which is instantiated in the individual. To run it on a machine instead means that the machine will have to emulate the “machine” that the software runs on, which <i>is</i> the whole brain, body and its environment.<p>We could of course try to make a non-human type of intelligence. But it’s not at all clear what that would be, or if it’s at all
possible. The only intelligence we know for sure can exist is animal&#x2F;human style intelligence. And I don’t think there’s anyone who is actually trying to construct a non-human intelligence. To do that it’s very likely that you’d have to set up a computer environment where programs evolve naturally and fight for computing resources over a long time. It could take anywhere from decades to millions of years.<p>Where most of our efforts are going, is to create augmented intelligence. We’re creating programs that expand on human intelligence. Interface with it. Cater to it.<p>If you imagine AI programs as individuals in an evolutionary environment. What is it that they’re competing for? They’re competing for which program can most satisfy humans. Those that satisfy us live. Those that don’t die. Just as our evolutionary environment creates drives for gathering resources, cooperating with others when possible, hurting&#x2F;killing others when necessary... programs are almost exclusively driven to satisfy humans.<p>That’s why I think the “paperclip maximizer” example is so ridiculous. First it assumes that general intelligence is just some magical algorithm we just haven’t discovered yet. Then it assumes that such an AI can make catastrophic decisions without complex motivations. Whether to kill humans or not is more efficient for making paper clips is an undecidable problem. A human might kill someone to achieve its goal because that’s something our evolutionary environment has trained us for. We have motivations like pride, ego, anger, envy, etc. that overrides the problem of figuring out “is killing this human optimal for my goals”<p>It’s far more likely that an AI catastrophe will be far harder to predict and much stranger. It could be that specialized (and relatively dumb in the genera sense) AIs become so good at satisfying our desires that we become completely incapacitated. There’s already signs of this.<p>Just to be clear, I’m not saying we shouldn’t be worried about AI. But the alarmists seems to be too focused on various imagined future scenarios, all of which are likely to be wrong. We should keep a very keen eye on the consequences of AI right now in the present moment, and talk about problems that actually arise. Perhaps with a little bit of extrapolation.. thinking about how present day small problems could develop into bigger problems."

That is, the reversible time evolution equation of state at time t2 can&#x27;t tell us the random time t2 - t1 or t1 so cannot recover the state at time t1 -- at time t2, we just do not know just when or how we got to the state at time t2.<p>So, the time evolution equation is time reversible but the event of the emission of the photon is not time reversible.<p>This <i>thought experiment</i> seems to conflict with the OP.  Where am I going wrong?"

I might be drinking the amazon koolaid but Shopify’s online service and physical product distribution can’t even come close to what amazon has developed. They’re not a real threat. Amazon is really at least 15 years ahead in distribution and operations. We’re using robotics to automate a ton of processes. Jeff Wilke revolutionized the fulfillment centers. Shopify’s platform mainly sells niche things at low throughputs. Amazon is about how can we sell more in the same amount of time so we can continue lowering prices to get more customers and keep selling more.
"China&#x27;s government certainly deserves criticism, but I notice that there has been a big increase in posts critical of China on large forums such as Reddit and Hacker News in the last half-year or so, which leads me to suspect that some such posts may be astroturfed or inspired by astroturfing. The Hong Kong situation could explain some of it, but the increase I refer to began before the recent Hong Kong crisis."
"I was a huge fan of KSP, bought into it back in like ~.8&#x2F;.9 days before there was anything to actually do, and I loved it.

"Worth noting that this is the blog&#x27;s first post. I like the tone, the humor, and the sheer nerve of writing something like this. It&#x27;s inspirational without being preachy.<p>It&#x27;s also highly actionable. Here&#x27;s how to apply it right now. Close your browser and all other applications. Open a text editor (or a can of paint or whatever). Reflect on something, anything. Then give yourself permission to make the worst possible version of something you like consuming. Write one sentence (or make one stroke), then another, and another. Eventually, rework the mess you&#x27;ve created.<p>Having forced myself to do this on several occasions, I can say it becomes addictive after a few days. And tiring. Which is why I also know it&#x27;s easy to relapse on an off day. Finding a way to keep motivated independent of external praise is critical."

"Honestly its horses for courses.<p>If you want to run your workload in the most secure manner using BSD jails then go for it, but you will soon find that anyone with expertise to maintain it is hard to find. Almost all DevOps&#x2F;SRE&#x2F;Systems Engineers want to run their workloads (containers) in Docker.<p>The same goes for LXD.<p>Lets get one thing right - none of these systems are a Virtual Machine with their own hardware and kernel. All 3 systems share the hosts kernel, albeit BSD has separation of workloads as a consideration within the kernel itself. The Linux kernel has cgroups as a building block, which to me almost makes it an afterthought.<p>I would never run a container with hostile code on the same Docker host as my mission critical workload. Hell, not even the same network (physical&#x2F;vpc&#x2F;overlay). However, I would give it more consideration if the same workloads were on a BSD machine with Jail separation. This was the premise of what I was employed to build in my previous job - <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;tredly&#x2F;tredly"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;tredly&#x2F;tredly</a> . A better separation of host and jail workload can be achieved though BSD jails as separation of concerns has been taken into consideration within the kernel, instead of building on top of the kernel.<p>This article is 2 years old. Linux cgroups and BSD jails have come leaps and bounds since. Docker may have been the &quot;flavour of the month&quot; back then, but it continues to be the DevOps&#x2F;SRE&#x2F;Systems Engineer&#x27;s tool of choice. Its not a silver bullet by any means, and has many shortcoming when used on its own. This why systems continue to be build on top of systems (tar -&gt; apt -&gt; docker -&gt; k8s -&gt; ?)<p>Of course all of the above assumes someone in my position as a DevOps engineer consuming resources upon either on-prem infrastructure or within the cloud. Workloads from an IaaS perspective are a completely different kettle of fish."

"When I was writing software for medical devices in the &#x27;90s, we had a very clear policies for dealing with cognitive drift that included performance ceilings, testing for drift in beta testing, etc.  In our testing, 10 seconds was the absolute maximum time that a surgeon could &quot;idle&quot; and stay on task in surgery.<p>In addition, we found that including spinners, progress bars, etc. would not necessarily reduce the cognitive drift but would reduce emotional frustration.<p>The worst thing for frustration was UI elements being slow; buttons that responded slowly, scrolls that lag, pull-downs that didn&#x27;t pull down.

Action is the key, and you don&#x27;t need a nature-like body to get this. AI driven action, that is what we need."

"So, interesting and all, but it ignores the main reason for the advice to build it first, then optimize for performance, which is that if you build everything for performance from the beginning, you end up with a lot of code that is optimizing for performance of something that isn&#x27;t the bottleneck.  In other words, performance that doesn&#x27;t show up in the user&#x27;s experience, because something else is the main delay.<p>Now, if all that meant was that the programmer has to do some more work, and you aren&#x27;t worried about paying more for the software, this may not matter, but that is far from the only (or even most important) result of optimizing everything for performance.  Instead, what you get is code that is much longer, and more complex, and therefore harder to update, and more likely to be buggy.<p>For example, one common thing you have to do to get performance, is to cache values in multiple places, instead of looking them up every time.  This can result in big improvements to software performance if done in the places which are the current limiting step, but now you have to make sure you invalidate the cache correctly.  In particular, if you don&#x27;t, you get stale values in the cache, which is to say false data.<p>If you make a system with cacheing all over the place, it will be very hard to make changes correctly, which means sometimes they will get made incorrectly.  In mission-critical systems, this is even less acceptable than elsewhere.<p>It&#x27;s not just &quot;I don&#x27;t feel like optimizing&quot;.  More often, it&#x27;s the cost of optimizing is not worth the benefit, for this particular part of the code.  How do you know what spots in the code it&#x27;s worth it?  You don&#x27;t optimize, at first, and then see which two or three spots in the system are rate-limiting."

"Sometimes &#x27;better-but-not-good-enough&#x27; is a trap. That&#x27;s basically what Jeff Vogel is saying about moving up from his poor inconsistent art to slightly better art, but it&#x27;s also how I feel about moving up from ascii characters to his style of &quot;crappy&quot; art.<p>AdoM is a fantastic roguelike created by Thomas Biskup, which originally had you as an &#x27;@&#x27; battling other ascii characters. Later he wanted a nicer interface and went for this kind of pixely tiles, and to be honest, I don&#x27;t like it (edit: I just checked again, and the art looks far better than I remember. I still prefer the ascii version, though). If you go for bad art, just go all the way, and make it look consistent.<p>By the way, Baba is You, referenced at the end, is an absolutely brilliant game, and while the art looks cheap like a toddler drew it, it&#x27;s all animated; they have three versions of every sprite and keep rotating them. That crappy animation arguably makes it look even cheaper, but it also brings the game more alive, and it&#x27;s certainly more expensive. Most importantly, though: it&#x27;s a striking and consistent look.<p>In the end, though: Jeff had been successfully making games he loves for 25 years. Whatever he&#x27;s doing is clearly working."
"Best survey of the subject I have found (most are bullshit) is  Finding Alpha by Eric Falkenstein which he has graciously offered for free on his blog. By the subject I mean, finding an edge in trading. Spoiler alert there is no system to follow. He wrote algos for a local options market maker, had a significant Econ PHD thesis. The basic premise of the book is that real Alpha is rare, idiosyncratic and gets exploited by those in the know and eventually the edge goes away after several years. He gives several classic historic examples which are what made this book so interesting and unique to me.

&gt;  IRS is auditing fewer tax returns from corporations because it has fewer people and resources available to identify potential errors and follow up on questionable tax returns<p>On one hand I do want businesses to pay their fair share. On the other hand I don&#x27;t want to encourage massive tax agencies which must justify their numbers by auditing and harassing as many people as possible. Often small businesses that don&#x27;t have to resources to defend themselves like large corporations.

"In the early 80&#x27;s, my parents pulled me out of California&#x27;s public schools when the state&#x2F;county ditched phonics for some unproven nonsense, to a private school that was founded on proven teaching methods (name of the school was Challenger). When I reentered a different public school district in grade 3, I was ahead of other students by around 2 grade-levels. In retrospect, the private school was far superior to the public school system, even in an upper-middle class area because the public schools experiment&#x2F;ed arbitrarily with curriculum in unproven ways on a large scale and didn&#x27;t seem to be held accountable at a large-scale for playing with children&#x27;s futures. Instead, individual teachers are micromanaged with outcomes of BS standardized tests.

"Depressed kids are a symptom of a sick society and bleak outlooks. You have to try really hard to point a finger at a single culprit, but we all know that&#x27;s just not the case. Sure, play is one important factor but let&#x27;s consider for a moment some additional points to connect for a bleak picture:<p>1. We <i>purposely</i> build addiction into social media which leads to more screen time. Anecdotally, there are so many examples of people quitting social media and feeling much better. Screen time is a huge factor for sure.<p>2. We put undo stress on our kids with all of the testing requirements.I remember how much anxiety and stress I got in school just thinking about the upcoming test. Now test frequency is completely insane when compared to when I was in school. I can only imagine how much stress this is adding to a kid&#x27;s day. So yeah, I think testing plays a big role in this too.<p>3. Kids (teens), are constantly exposed to the fear-mongering headlines bombarding them day in day out. Since we set up our media to profit from pageviews, we&#x27;ve created a situation where it pays to play up to people&#x27;s fears. Kids read these things too and in many cases do not have the mental models or capacity to differentiate clickbait bs. vs substantive information. Hell, even adults (as witnessed by at least 50% of US population) can&#x27;t differentiate between fact and fiction.<p>4. Lack of play time. OF COURSE kids are not going to develop properly if they can&#x27;t learn to socialize and participate in society. OF COURSE they&#x27;ll distance themselves back into the screen where, OOPS, they&#x27;ll read more of those nasty headlines and while at it think about the upcoming test. It doesn&#x27;t help that we now have (billion?)-dollar gaming companies pulling every trick in the book to build addiction into every interaction. What better way to escape the problems of the real world than to retrieve into the virtual one? I can&#x27;t blame them... this is what I personally did as a teen.<p>5. Climate change - probably one of the most understated reasons that leaves children hopeless. While we keep debating on the best ways to solve our climate problems, kids are left hopeless about their futures. We have grown ass adults taking to Twitter to insult teens for trying to take some sort of action while those same grown ass adults are sitting on their hands or swiping their facebook feeds.<p>6. Increased hopelessness, depression and isolation among adults - how are kids supposed to learn to explore on their own and that there is more to life than your screen when their parents are increasingly isolating themselves from the world. When you have a government that is hellbent on making your life more difficult by fueling inequality, what possible hope do you have as a child when you see how your parents struggle to make ends meet? &quot;oh so this is what I have to look forward to...&quot;<p>You could pick apart any one of those points to trace the origins and have enough to write a Times essay. The point being, it&#x27;s one massive clusterfuck with multiple points of failure. If we want our kids to have any sort of a decent and bright future full of joy, we should start looking at how to fix our own problems. Start looking at reducing inequality, proactive automation readiness, better social systems, fewer guns, policies to reduce consumption, subsidies for alternative energies and de-carbonization, complete education reform to do away with insane testing, strict laws on what can and cannot make it into consumer apps in terms of addiction building, and so on and so on."

"For those proposing solutions to problems that may not actually exist, here&#x27;s an idealized paper ballot chain of custody, in story form...<p>A ballot is printed. It is then packaged, along with many of its siblings, in a stack. That stack of ballots is placed in a sealed package, and that package is given a serial number.<p>The state election officials receive this sealed package from the printer and record its serial number. It is then put in locked storage.<p>At election time, the package is taken from the warehouse and delivered to a polling place. At the polling place, at least two election judges, from different political parties, accept the package and sign for it.<p>The package is taken to a table staffed by at least two election judges, along with folders, pens, and &quot;I voted&quot; stickers. It is opened, the contents validated, and custody signed off by those judges.<p>Another table has printed rolls of all registered voters for the precinct, and at least two judges. When a voter arrives, they give their name (no id needed), and the judges look them up. They sign their name next to their registration, and go to the ballot table. Meanwhile, the judges increment the count of how many voters have signed in.<p>At the ballot table, our ballot (remember our individual ballot?) is handed to the voter in a folder, along with a pen and a sticker. The ballot is now in the custody of the voter, who signed for it in the registration book.<p>The voter goes to a booth, fills in their ballot, and inserts it in a ballot box. (This may be a Scantron-type machine that also reads the ballot.) Assuming automation, the box reads the ballot, tallies the results, and drops the ballot itself in a locked internal box.<p>At the end of the day, the judges write down the total number of ballots in the machines. They compare this to the number of voters who signed the registration. If these numbers do not match, these results are hand-counted again.<p>Assuming everything matches, the judges report the preliminary results from the machines (or if they are not machines, the judges count the results of the ballots). The locked ballot boxes are removed from the machines by at least two judges, and signed off.<p>Unused blank ballots, both opened and sealed, are also counted.<p>The locked ballot boxes are then delivered to state election officials, who sign off on receipt.<p>In case of an audit or a recount, each box can be traced to the individual machine and compared to the machine count.<p>So... what security problems do you see with this model? And what solution do you propose for the problem you see?"

"I&#x27;d be very interested to know what experts think of Peter Naur&#x27;s Turing Award lecture (entitled &quot;Computing Versus Human Thinking&quot;), which has a thesis along similar lines to the article.

"This seems to be comparing a hand implemented neural network in python (and numpy) and one in rust. Even in this simple case, the author discovers that in the python case, most of the time is spent in non-python linear algebra libraries.<p>Most of the major deep learning frameworks for python (tensorflow, keras, torch, mxnet, etc) will not normally be spending the majority of their time in python. Typically, the strategy is to use python to declare the overall structure of the net, and where to load data from, and then the actual heavy lifting will be done in optimized libraries written probably in C++ (or fortran, I seem to recall BLAS used fortran)."

Increasingly, both parents work full time and don&#x27;t&#x2F;can&#x27;t rely on family for child care. The &quot;and&quot; is critical here, because in the past you might have had a single parent or dual income parents, but also had grandmothers and aunties as support. An increasingly mobile workforce, and smaller families mean that familial support structures are dwindling.<p>2. &quot;Being a kid&quot; is illegal. If you&#x27;re under 12 in most of Virginia, you can&#x27;t be unsupervised by an adult for more than three hours and can&#x27;t be unsupervised overnight until you&#x27;re 16.

"I want to like J, but I find that most of my programs get too cluttered with @: all over the place. I see the k-means example shown here has a similar problem (7 usages of @: in only 4 lines of J). I find implicit programming a more elegant paradigm, but lambdas with pre-declared argument names (like x,y,z in k or α and ω in Dyalog APL) more comfortable to work with (and, at least for the time being, more productive).<p>I think part of the reason is that J&#x27;s syntax for function composition is too heavy. In an improved visualization of J like the one shown here, I would find very interesting to try something like, for example, composition by simple juxtaposition and trains with under(or over)lining, maybe even playing with colors to indicate if verbs form a train or other composition. I understand that is a quite different problem from just substituting @: with o̲.<p>Nevertheless, very nice work. It is interesting to see the English and APL versions next to each other. The video is also very good."

"Just to toss in my two cents about testing:<p>Unit tests are for refactoring and declaring behaviour. Additionally, a lot of people have made the same observation: Code that is easy to unit test tends to be more modular and have better architecture. If you are struggling to test a function, think about how you can change your design to make testing easier. It will probably improve your code quality.<p>Integration tests are for finding bugs and exceptions and should be a part of CI&#x2F;CD.<p>You want both. The more testing the better.<p>Comments: I find comments, outside of docstrings, a smell. Even then: Docstrings often become a substitution for a decent type system, so maybe think about what is happing there as well.<p>Documentation should be generated from your codebase. Otherwise, it will inevitably become out of date as people forget to update it. If you need to comment on what something is doing, usually you can move that behaviour into a function and test that function."

"Love their product, hate their shady billing.<p>I&#x27;m in the middle of a bad experience with Datadog&#x27;s billing&#x2F;sales team. My monthly Custom Metrics usage wasn&#x27;t being billed for because they said they didn&#x27;t have a way to track it. Naturally my usage gradually increased because without the monthly bill increasing. When renewing a while back they went over my usage on phone and quoted prices, same usage profile as this month. Now this month my bill increased almost 400% and they said &quot;oh we just soft-launched billing for this feature without notifying you&quot;. No heads-up when communicating with them that I wasn&#x27;t actually being billed for my usage.<p>Still trying to get a refund for this curveball bill. Their sales team keeps forever escalating to management, leadership, and they say it has to be approved by a C-level.

"&gt;On Tuesday, Nevada became the latest state to pass a bill that would grant its electoral votes to whoever wins the popular vote across the country, not just in Nevada. The movement is the brainchild of John Koza, a co-founder of National Popular Vote, an organization that is working to eliminate the influence of the Electoral College.<p>I don&#x27;t think this will survive constitutional challenge, because it is not the voters of the state who are deciding how the state&#x27;s electors are decided. For example, would it be allowed for a swing state such as Florida which now has a Republican governor and state legislature, to pass a law stating that their state&#x27;s electors would be allocated based on how Alabama votes? That way, even if the Democratic candidate won a majority of votes in Florida, the electors would still go to the Republican candidate if the Republican candidate wins in Alabama."

"I&#x27;ve taught this stuff before and I find it best to start with boolean logic and combinatorial circuits, then sequential ones, but don&#x27;t just jump into building a CPU right away; instead, after discussing clocked&#x2F;sequential logic and registers&#x2F;memory (&quot;storage loops&quot;), I discuss a counter, then connect the output of the counter to the address inputs of a memory to create a machine that just reads memory. Adding an &quot;accumulator&quot; and adder turns that into a rudimentary adding machine, and I note that such a machine was already able to save --- or eliminate, depending on your viewpoint (although I rarely will go on an ethical tangent) --- countless hours of human labour at the beginning of the last century. I then slowly evolve the adding machine into something closer to a CPU by making it capable of other operations than adding (and this is also a good time to show the elegance of two&#x27;s complement), gradually turning the numbers stored in memory into not just data to be added, but operation codes, and eventually, with the addition of control flow and indirection instructions, memory addresses too.<p>This &quot;bottom-up&quot; approach tends to bore some students, but in my experience also leads to far deeper understanding than more superficial ones that skip over a lot of the intermediate steps. It helps to keep the interest by showing these machines actually working, either with actual logic chips and a breadboard, or a simulator; and of course give the students hands-on experience if possible."

"My question is, who is to say that X &quot;FICO Score&quot; correlates to anything <i>too</i> meaningful -- or that the score itself has not become harder or easier to obtain?<p>Perhaps the data exists on this, but to my unresearched mind there&#x27;s a lot of &quot;fudging&quot; potential within it all by itself.  For instance, maybe the current &#x27;borrower state&#x27; that gets you a 690 previously would have given you a 725;  or maybe it&#x27;s the opposite.<p>I understand how averages work, but is there any oversight or auditing done on the rating agencies and the ratings themselves?  It just seems ripe for &#x27;gaming&#x27; at that level IMO;  if banks need to sell financial products and they buy the ratings from the agencies, surely they can lean on an agency to &#x27;fudge&#x27; numbers one direction or the other (I&#x27;m speaking in aggregates here)?<p>Anecdotally, every time I look at my credit score I cringe -- I&#x27;ve never carried much debt, have always paid it off on time or early, and yet my credit score stays somewhat low, seemingly because I largely don&#x27;t participate in &quot;the system&quot;.  Furthermore, every time I&#x27;ve ever applied for credit I end up with scores (and offers of credit) far in excess of the numbers I see when I either get my &#x27;free credit report&#x27; from the 3 agencies, and they&#x27;re similarly different than the numbers I see if I pay to see my reports from the 3 agencies.<p>I don&#x27;t know, it just seems like a &quot;chicken-egg&quot; problem to me, and one where the rating agencies are perhaps incentivized in a way that does not align with the &quot;economy&quot; as a whole -- and is instead much more closely with their high-value customers (lenders).  I also feel like there&#x27;s so much &quot;missing data&quot;, which could probably tell quite the tale, for instance, if someone such as Google was to begin a &#x27;ratings agency&#x27;.  Half of my finds that to be a scary thought, the other half of me thinks that we&#x27;d probably end up with objectively better outcomes, both economically and probably, in many cases, even individually too."

"This seems materially different than the reverse operation - taking a book and turning it into an audio experience. Doing so may diminish the book&#x27;s experience because the AI voice &#x2F; TTS may not convey the book correctly and could damage the user experience.<p>Captioning seems more like a facilitation of experience, using only the audio to add an additional layer on it. It&#x27;s like saying the credits for a movie are copywrited and Amazon can&#x27;t use that content for X-Ray (I&#x27;m aware they use IMBD and Amazon owns that).<p>It&#x27;s certainly a gray area, but I feel the publishers are simply afraid that buying an audio book that is captioned may cannabalize their text-based book business, which seems disingenuous. The accessibility of a book of text is very different than captioned audio.<p>What if people can&#x27;t hear well, but like the emotive layer added to captions in a reader&#x27;s voice&#x2F;pace, etc?<p>I can see uses for this that could be argued however - for instance, using the captions as a reading facilitator. The customer is using it like a book, with audio captions, not an audio book with hearing-impaired captions. Using the transcribed text to translate to a different language may also be infringing on copywrite as to provide an unofficially translated version of the text.<p>Assuming that there was an app on your phone that you could use to point at the Kindle readhing your audio book out loud and transcribing the text clearly isn&#x27;t copywrite infringement, so the debate seems to be around Amazon providing this as an integrated service.<p>I think all that needs to be done is to allow the publisher to decide if that feature is enabled or not. Customers will obviously buy books that are captioned over ones that aren&#x27;t, because you&#x27;re getting more &quot;content,&quot; and I can imagine publishers would charge more for this. Which is of course, what it ultimately comes down to - Money.<p>Publishers who didn&#x27;t provide captions wouldn&#x27;t get the business of those who want them, and those that don&#x27;t care will make a decision on availability and price. Seems like Amazon could let their marketplace decide what people want, but they are in a legal position where they may consider it worth fighting. The trouble begins when you start asking the questions, &quot;well, if Amazon wins, would publishers simply stop publishing their books on Amazon?&quot; Then the monopoly question comes up.<p>I can see arguments both ways, and if the licensing terms to Amazon aren&#x27;t clear, then Amazon should simply make them clearer and allow the marketplace participants fall where they may."

"A lot of the need for AC (and having lights on) is just really, really bad modern house design. I recently finished building a house (my first one) and everyone acted like I was crazy for not building in central air conditioning. (This is in New Hampshire)<p>I built in an older style, with windows on every side, with a mind towards ventilation and light. Inexplicably most houses in the area, even $500k+ houses do not have these two things. My mom&#x27;s condo has central air but the system is so feeble and the venting upstairs so poor that two bedrooms in the house remain stuffy anyways. It seems like light and natural ventilation are not even afterthoughts, but non-thoughts, and the designs all rely on electric light and forced air. Its amazing being in an expensive home where you need a light on in the kitchen at 8am. How do they decide what to build?<p>I built 9 foot ceilings on the first floor and 8.5 on the second. Then I placed the attic (3rd story) door centrally in the upstairs hallway. The result of the design is that airflow moves on the first floor in all directions, and upward, and on the second floor can move <i>at least</i> east-west (bathroom and hallway windows), and also north-south if bedroom doors are open. Finally, air flows upwards to the attic, which has windows north-south. So winds should suck air higher, and out.<p>If I close windows in the morning and open around 7pm, the result is that the house stays very cool, about(? only tested with temp gun a few times) 74 downstairs and 76 upstairs during these 90 degree days, and then gets cooler at night as I open windows again. So far, I&#x27;ve only bought one fan, though things might work better with more. Note I&#x27;m not an expert or an architect, I just included some design features that should be obvious to anyone who&#x27;s lived in an old house for a summer.<p>This takes some manual control, but there are far fewer parts to maintain (this was a general design goal beyond AC), and summer electric bills are $50-60&#x2F;month. With this design, there have been 3 icky-hot days so far this year, when there was no wind and the night did not get very cool."

"It&#x27;s so hard to read literary criticism with its deluge of questionable logic in every sentence.

"I for one wish you the best of luck, and hope you develop an effective and accurate product. While I may have conflicting feelings about police municipalities and the justice system, the breathalyzer has overwhelmingly been a good thing, and has saved countless lives by keeping the roads safe.<p>Questions:<p>- What do you think the likelihood&#x2F;timeline is that these tests will eventually be comparable in speed and accuracy to alcohol breathalyzers?<p>- Have you yet looked into the legal implications of a cannabis breathalyzer? Does it fall under the same rules and restrictions of a standard breathalyzer?<p>- How rigorously are you testing for false positives? Can you tell someone who has taken drugs but they have worn off vs someone who is currently high?<p>- Will you be making your data open source? Companies that sell proprietary technology to police departments can notoriously complicate legal cases when they do not disclose technical limitations or the possibilities of false positives or negatives.<p>- Will you be restricting your product sales only to regions where marijuana is already legal?

"I would like to understand this better because WeWork has a lot of open positions right now. Is it all a front? Much of this article seems to focus on it not having the margins and network effects of Apple, Facebook, etc.<p>Devil’s advocate: Amazon has dinky margins and was unprofitable for many of its early years. Physical servers have “wear and tear”. But they are a winner because they have developed competencies and efficiencies that let them rent out infrastructure that fast growing companies would rather not own and manage. Could WeWork be like AWS for office space?<p>Looking at their open positions they have teams around evaluating, visualizing and instrumenting spaces. In addition to the flexibility to scale up and down. There’s a lot that’s sketch about their company structure but if companies are going to outsource say payments to 3rd parties like Stripe, why wouldn’t they do it for office space which is a huge PITA?"

"I grew up in South Florida, and I&#x27;m surprised to hear people think the storm is getting bigger over time. I guess that&#x27;s just something you grow up with knowing down there. People on the west coast tell me they&#x27;re terrified of hurricanes, and I&#x27;m terrified of earthquakes. You can generally get out of the way of a hurricane if you feel you need to...<p>There are of course common sense things to do to be prepared: get bottled water, food, fill your bathtubs with water and a drop of bleach, make sure the car has a full tank of gas. We personally brought my grandparents down from Boca to stay with us. You can do those maybe a week, 4 days out before stores start to get really empty (grandparents can be moved earlier or later). If you have any coconuts palm trees, chop down your coconuts. These are common sense things to do if there&#x27;s a remote possibility of a tropical storm or hurricane coming your way.<p>But I do think it&#x27;s a little disingenuous to say that people didn&#x27;t do enough to prepare if they lived on the west coast, given how quickly the path shifted. Partly because the NHC is generally so good at their predictions. If you saw the earlier map that had Irma going up east coast, and you were in Naples, you wouldn&#x27;t think about moving, or at least I wouldn&#x27;t. Our buildings, especially the newer ones, are built to withstand at least some level of wind. My house built in the 90s has held up through multiple Category 3s (Charlie and Wilma). It&#x27;s of course all luck, and I know plenty of other houses that have had damage, parts of the roof torn off, shattered windows, though nothing catastrophic, built around the same time. I&#x27;ve driven through the outer bands of a tropical storm (not that you should, but I was in high school and we had a back to school party the night before, and I wanted the car to be home).<p>That&#x27;s not to disparage the work of the NHC. They&#x27;re great at what they do, and I read pretty much every advisory for every hurricane that&#x27;s in the Atlantic. When you&#x27;ve got no place to go, a hurricane bearing down on you is a very scary thing. But if I&#x27;m in Naples, and 4 days out it looks like it&#x27;s heading towards Ft. Lauderdale? I&#x27;m not making plans to move."

"Call me a cynic, but I don&#x27;t see how this doesn&#x27;t hurt drivers.  It sounds good, but it&#x27;s too good to be true.  I&#x27;m wondering if they are factoring in only the amount of time actually driving.  So if you have a 5 minute drive in 60 minutes, at 21.00 per hour you only make 1.75.

"Most engineers I have met in Silicon Valley have a very high standard of personal ethics.  For example, I have seen engineers risk their own careers to insist that their employers give back to open source projects when the employer is in violation of an open-source license&#x27;s terms.<p>But I&#x27;ve also seen a few, rare bad apples.  There are some people who are borderline sociopathic, who don&#x27;t think twice about theft, misdirection, misappropriation of credit, and throwing co-workers under the bus for personal gain.<p>Usually, such people are not caught, and are not punished ... ever.  People who learn about such sociopaths, just avoid them.<p>But sometimes these sociopaths go too far.  This seems to be one such case.<p>This prosecution will discourage the very worst behavior and it will feel therapeutic for people that have felt victimized by various sociopaths who used them as ladders on the climb to fame and wealth ... but the less criminal kinds of sociopathy in the workplace is probably never going to go away.  And there&#x27;s no real way to stop it.<p>I haven&#x27;t been to Google or worked with Google in a long time, but for a while there, say between 2010 and 2015, I felt like it was chock full of sociopaths in mid-level management.

"I&#x27;d recommend starting with Firefox, and configuring Firefox&#x27;s cookie settings to always block third party cookies.<p>Next, if you have a good password manager that can auto-fill logins, set Firefox to delete all cookies (and everything else) when you close the browser. That way, every time you open your browser you&#x27;re starting from a clean slate. I promise you&#x27;ll quickly get used to logging in every time, and it won&#x27;t be that hard.<p>Next, enable Firefox&#x27;s Multi-Account Containers add-on. This basically allows you to isolate sites you commonly use into their own cookie realms. Create containers for the sites you want to isolate (Google, Facebook, LinkedIn, etc.) and set those domains to always open in that domain&#x27;s container. That way, when you click on a link to Facebook it will auto open a new tab in that Facebook container.<p>Next, install uBlock Origin. I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s a need to install Privacy Badger since you&#x27;re already blocking third party cookies, but others please correct me.<p>Next, for websites that don&#x27;t work with uBlock Origin, create a dedicated container for that domain and set to always open in that container. Then, whitelist in uBlock Origin whatever tracker on that site you need to run things properly. That way, the tracker is isolated to just that domain&#x27;s container.<p>Overall, Firefox&#x27;s Multi-Account Containers are extremely powerful for isolating site cookies and trackers. I wish they would allow you to set different cookie settings per container, so you could by default clear cookies when you close Firefox and add exceptions for specific containers, but even given that deficiency, is still the most powerful browser feature that&#x27;s come out since tabs."

"I have been building large scale&#x2F;distributed systems myself and reviewing designs of systems like these being built around me, for years now.

We&#x27;re talking about real-world systems that are high-load and somewhat novel, with battle-scarred engineers building them.<p>I find it ironic that that many of the people who write about architecture are consultants or writers. Consultants usually come into a project, make some decisions and write some code in a few months. Then they leave, without having to maintain the application. Of course they bring in fancy-named architecture patterns as one-size-fits-all solutions, leaving before the cracks on the approach show. Ever notice how little writing there is about iterative software design?<p>For writers, it seems they build a simple proof-of-concept solution, that is never deployed in production, documenting this process and showing it off as an example.<p>Yet, when it comes to writing about software architecture, this is 90% of the materials. Engineers who build this day in, day out, design systems from inception, iterate on them, code and deploy, then maintain and operate them for years - they barely share what approach they took. And it&#x27;s none of this fancy-talk in articles like this one. It&#x27;s not UML or other formal methods. It&#x27;s simple documents, simple diagrams, lots of discussion about tradeoffs and tons of back-and-forth comments over Google Docs&#x2F;O365 and in real life.<p>I&#x27;m at the point where I&#x27;m serioulsly debating writing something more substantial on how <i>actual</i> software design works at tech companies, when you&#x27;re not a consultant or a writer, but an engineer who does this full-time, end-to-end, living with all the consequences of decisions and fixing mistakes after.<p>On the importance of prototyping, extensible MVPs, whiteboarding, documenting an initial design and getting feedback, iterating on it, architecture jams, design war rooms - and when starting again when the world&#x2F;business changes substantially, keeping things running and migrating things over to the new system."

"OP makes highly dubious claims and does not pass a basic smell test:<p>ALL CLAIMS MADE ARE DUBIOUS: Implementing 130+ papers in 7 months is highly implausible. This would require:<p>- Insane productivity.<p>- Implausible access to pricing and news data resources (which are often not freely available).<p>- Expertise in machine learning, natural language processing, finance, and data science. OP had to implement financial, time-series and linguistic feature engineering pipelines, as well infer the architecture and hyper-parameters used in all papers AND train all these models. ALL WITHIN 7 MONTHS. All while previously being a trader professionally i.e. not likely an expert in many of these fields.<p>- OP also claims he &quot;web scraped&quot; all the data which is highly unlikely as price datasets are often sold for a pretty penny and not publicly available in the detail described in several of these papers.<p>- Down the thread, OP says he does not know what a &quot;meta analysis&quot; study is al the while being capable of implementing 130+ papers. So someone who is an expert in ML, statistics, data science and finance does not know one of the most basic types of scientific study. All the while essentially engaging in a meta analysis study.<p>- OP describes himself as &quot;a trader at a Tier 1 US bank&quot; to lend credibility to his post: in itself that description is ridiculous and sounds like a naive attempt at instilling authority.<p>- When others encourage OP to publish results, he answers evasively: &quot;probably a bit deep for a public forum but I was kinda glad to see the back of that work.

There is no proof of the work done whatsoever, no code samples, not even result tables or graphs. The discussion of basic results are often made criticisms of this line of research.<p>MOTIVATION:<p>At the end OP shills his cryptotrading bot.
This post was likely all just purely made-up to market his cryptotrading bot service. OP uses some common criticisms of market prediction research to garner authority as a wizz-kid to attract people to his crypto scam.<p>What&#x27;s worse many on HN and Reddit seem to gobble it up naively.

Or is this just a symptom of a bad value-chain ecosystem? Shouldn’t other players be cropping up to be external “shopping search engines” that find you the real, quality items on Amazon’s (and other stores’) huge junk-piles, the way that Google finds you real, quality web pages among the junk-pile that is the web?<p>Sure, it’d be <i>nice</i> if Amazon solved the problem itself.

"my typical experience with these kinds of things: I start looking at the source code, and the code is actually simple and short, the logic is easy to follow (make a grid, allow and process formulas in cells, display the grid and some additional edit-mode display if you are editing a cell)... but then I start seeing dependencies, references to other frameworks and multiple languages, libraries... and all that looks so confusing! the dependencies require at least an order of magnitude more knowledge to be understood or used effectively than what we are being shown in the post; that&#x27;s the really tricky part to me. don&#x27;t mean to criticize that, those are probably very powerful tools that in most cases you want to know about and use (if you are working in that specific environment), but it&#x27;s like... are those 100 lines of F# even that important? writing your own excel sounds nice, but I feel it&#x27;s more &quot;how to glue a bit of F# logic to a web-compatible UI&quot; (well, yeah, one could argue those are really the same things).<p>&gt; &quot;The final spreadsheet application is quite simple&quot;<p>Is it?

"The lack of spell-check was pretty great in helping to focus in on writing.

Five minutes essay below... also, first post (hello!) to Hacker News.<p>This is a test of the most dangerous writing app in the world. I am typing in whatever comes to mind in a stream of consciousness, but with proper capitalization, punctuation, and grammar. I could never tolerate a stream of consciousness essay on a standardized test, such as the ACT. For example, when I was a junior in high school, I encountered one of these beasts which I found nearly impenetrable to digest, followed by thirty-odd questions asking for my detailed interpretation of the steaming pile, which I am sure was never written to be used to abuse young adults just trying to set up the next step in their academic career. I can imagine some panel of experts somewhere picking out this shining example of obtuseness as the essay for the test, cackling to themselves about how useless this is either predicting future success, or as a test of any specific (useful) skill. On the other hand, maybe we all have that one colleague at work who writes email in stream of consciousness mode. Who knows, if I didn&#x27;t face-plant on that ACT back in the day, maybe I would never have brushed up on unlearning English. Such is life, we will never know. I do know however that I paid for that test, and I paid for the next test after that thanks to that essay. Ok, now this brings us to the present day. Here I am, writing in to a random screen buffer on the Internet, which promises to delete my text if I do not continue generating words for five minutes straight. It is especially evil in that A) there is no timer and I didn&#x27;t think to check the clock; B) I do not know where or if this will be posted somewhere; and C) this is yet another useless life skill.

Over here in the UK we’re a bit better, but the “give them exams ALL the time” and schools being on their knees, financially, are all too familiar.<p>For me, this journey with my kids has been about a massive slew of things, among the most important:<p>- extending their childhood where possible: encouraging actual play (and discouraging the pseudo-play of screens)
- letting them out: outside play when they’re younger (my kids dicked about in streams and woods from about 5&#x2F;6 years old); now they’re older (14&#x2F;12) they take themselves off swimming, into town, to the shops, on the bus to the nearest city 2 hours away, etc
- reading, reading, reading. Always.
- talking and appreciating them as adults and not as kids. This means trying not to patronise, being adult when talking about politics, religion, sex
- being more present: for example, I’ve had a Nokia 3310 rather than a smartphone for more than a year now, and a large part of this has been about not being constantly distracted when I’m with other people, particularly my kids
- be there: work less, hangout more. I work for myself, but never evenings or weekends, these are family time.

"Hello guys. It’s me, Hanif. Just a response to some of the comments here:<p>1. I think it’s absolutely fair to criticize this aspect of the analysis: the relative frequencies of the backgrounds of data scientists have been presented as suggesting the success rate from each field. Many of the comments in the post itself made a similar critique. As I’ve acknowledged in my responses to these comments, what we need are the relative frequencies of applicants from the different backgrounds, not just hires. However, one can justify the inference about the success rate of, say, Statisticians and Actuaries if one has the prior belief that the relative frequency of statistician applicants to DS positions should be higher than the observed relative frequency of statistician hires (&lt;1%!) to DS positions. I don’t think this is unreasonable.
2. I make a similar argument with regards to MOOCs&#x2F;bootcamps: my prior belief is that the relative frequency of bootcamp-only applicants should be higher than the observed relative frequency of bootcamp-only hires. Hence my statement about necessity vs. sufficiency.
3. It’s somewhat more complicated for applicants with both degrees and MOOCs&#x2F;bootcamps. I haven’t done this, but what I can do is to look at the education distribution for hires with and without MOOCs. If the education distributions were similar, it would suggest that MOOCs have negligible impact. If, however, there is a higher relative frequency of say Bachelor’s degrees in the MOOC category, that would suggest that MOOCs&#x2F;bootcamps have some value-added impact.
4. An ideal prospective study for the above would be to extract a sample of individuals from a precursor role, say, data analysts (hence naturally controlling for education). Note which of them have MOOCs or bootcamps, then follow them up in time to see how many end up as data scientists in each category.
5. I might actually change that profile picture. It’s 3 years old, in more innocent times.
6. As it happens I have landed a data scientist position in Singapore and will be starting in September."

"I will preface this comment by saying that I am sympathetic to the author&#x27;s criticism of the Soviet system which he has inherited from Solzhenitsyn, but being sympathetic to the communist hypothesis myself, I feel like there are omissions in the article worth picking up on.<p>The article reads,<p>&gt;The contrary view, held by ideologues and justice warriors generally, is that our group is good, and theirs is evil. “Evil people committing evil deeds”: this is the sort of thinking behind notions like class conflict or the international Zionist conspiracy.<p>This is wrong, and a cursory investigation of Marx&#x27;s late works would show that. Not only does the theory of class conflict not rest on the idea that capitalists are &quot;evil people committing evil deeds&quot;, but it does not project Marx&#x27;s &quot;proletariat&quot; as inherently virtuous. Marx, in fact, takes great pains to avoid this misinterpretation of his work; take for example the 1867 preface to the German edition of Capital[0]:<p>&gt;To prevent possible misunderstanding, a word. I paint the capitalist and the landlord in no sense couleur de rose [i.e., seen through rose-tinted glasses]. But here individuals are dealt with only in so far as they are the personifications of economic categories, embodiments of particular class-relations and class-interests. My standpoint, from which the evolution of the economic formation of society is viewed as a process of natural history, can less than any other make the individual responsible for relations whose creature he socially remains, however much he may subjectively raise himself above them.<p>It is a theory of society, not of some people who, somehow, are evil due to their economic position. Modern commentators on Marx argue that he does not argue for a socialist society on the basis of &quot;justice&quot; or what is &quot;right&quot; - in fact, he does the opposite - his claim is that would be in the &quot;best interests&quot; of the working class to overcome this unintentionally constructed system. Would the author have compared Smith&#x27;s invisible hand to people doing intentionally good deeds? I don&#x27;t think it would - so it&#x27;s a mystery why it feels the need to misrepresent Marx, especially given the fact you can read all of Marx&#x27;s works online... for free.<p>Not so with the theory of the international Zionist conspiracy, which is a right-wing idea predicated on the &quot;fact&quot; of Zionists who are intentionally coordinating with each other for malicious purposes. Of course, the article omits Solzhenitsyn&#x27;s anti-semitism from this discussion. It would be inconvenient to mention it, I suppose.<p>The article then reads,<p>&gt;Mercy, kindness, compassion: these were all anti-Bolshevik emotions, and schoolchildren were taught to reject them. I know of no previous society where children were taught that compassion and mercy are vices.<p>As much as they may have been anti-Bolshevik emotions, they are also anti-capitalist emotions, and this is exemplified on a massive scale in modern society where even in developed (&quot;first world&quot;) countries people starve and die because they cannot afford insulin. The compassion, in fact, only comes from people who aren&#x27;t out to make a profit even if it means the misery of another.<p>Later,<p>&gt;For a true materialist, Lenin maintained, there can be no Kantian categorical imperative to regard others only as ends, not as means. By the same token, the materialist does not acknowledge the supposed sanctity of human life.<p>The author is clearly unfamiliar with Marx&#x27;s own theories of morality (which Sean Sayers elucidates in <i>Marxism and Human Nature</i>[1]) and misunderstands the conflict between materialism and idealism in Marx&#x27;s sense. The materialist argues that morality derives from actual social formations, the &quot;tradition of all dead generations&quot; - this does not make the morality &quot;invalid&quot; or &quot;wrong&quot;, but it is an acceptance of the scientific method as applied to the gaeneology of morals. One can be both a moral realist and a Marxist, since Marxism entails a material analysis of how things have developed in society. In the same way, one can be a moral realist and believe, with Kant&#x27;s categorical imperative, that it is morally impermissible to lie at any time for any reason, which conflicts with many perspectives on what it is right for a Christian to do.<p>Then,<p>&gt;They may have insisted that high moral ideals do not require belief in God, but when it came down to it, morals grounded in nothing but one’s own conviction and reasoning, however cogent, proved woefully inadequate under experiential, rather than logical, pressure.<p>This is simply a re-statement of the old myth that when in mortal danger an atheist will also pray. It&#x27;s not backed up by anything, but then again - nothing else in the article is either. The author used a pithily inaccurate characterization of class conflict (and failed to link it to the scientific aspect of historical materialism), argued that the core capitalist tenets of thrift and stinginess driving accumulation which are seen so essential to entrepeneurship today are not found in &quot;any previous society&quot;, and then tried to reclaim the horrific actions of the Soviet state as being due to atheism while ignoring the fact that it is secularism that brings the tolerance the liberal author is so proud of in Western democracies.<p>[0] Available here: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.marxists.org&#x2F;archive&#x2F;marx&#x2F;works&#x2F;1867-c1&#x2F;p1.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.marxists.org&#x2F;archive&#x2F;marx&#x2F;works&#x2F;1867-c1&#x2F;p1.htm</a><p>[1] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;books.google.fr&#x2F;books&#x2F;about&#x2F;Marxism_and_Human_Nature.html?id=Vnr2zjct2-kC&amp;redir_esc=y"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;books.google.fr&#x2F;books&#x2F;about&#x2F;Marxism_and_Human_Nature...</a>"

So I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the arguing that is necessarily the problem. Arguments are simply the reasoning behind conclusions. The ugly parts of argumentation are more about style and irresponsible rhetoric.<p>(I&#x27;d also suggest that the common online format incentivizes boorishness.

"How dangerous is this app? I mean how much time does it give me? Is the danger that my document will be lost, or that in attempting not to let that happen I will write too much. I will write the wrong thing. I will go down paths which are meant not to be followed, ordinarily edited out of existence. This is the danger, I suspect. But the other is also. It is a double danger. This double danger models a double danger in other areas. It is perhaps a fundamental mode of danger. Dangerness. The fear of a thing which both prevents or enables, complementarily. How does that work? What are examples? Can we name a time the fear has positively (we posit) prevented manifestation? Certainly. In general, it is socially unacceptable to analyze or look too deeply past the constructs which supposedly shield prying eyes from the conclusions which would be evident if the components were scrutinized. China Miéville explores this exquisitely in The City and The City. There citizens of two nearly colocated cities &#x27;unsee&#x27; the other by law. Likewise, we ordinarily must unsee what is meant to be unseen. The danger then is that our unseeing be threatened by the possiblity that we lose sight altogether.

"Perhaps as a counterpoint, this poem:<p>The Men That Don&#x27;t Fit In [0]
By Robert W. Service<p>There&#x27;s a race of men that don&#x27;t fit in,
A race that can&#x27;t stay still;
So they break the hearts of kith and kin,
And they roam the world at will.
They range the field and they rove the flood,
And they climb the mountain&#x27;s crest;
Theirs is the curse of the gypsy blood,
And they don&#x27;t know how to rest.<p>If they just went straight they might go far;
They are strong and brave and true;
But they&#x27;re always tired of the things that are,
And they want the strange and new.
They say: &quot;Could I find my proper groove,
What a deep mark I would make!&quot;
So they chop and change, and each fresh move
Is only a fresh mistake.<p>And each forgets, as he strips and runs
With a brilliant, fitful pace,
It&#x27;s the steady, quiet, plodding ones
Who win in the lifelong race.
And each forgets that his youth has fled,
Forgets that his prime is past,
Till he stands one day, with a hope that&#x27;s dead,
In the glare of the truth at last.<p>He has failed, he has failed; he has missed his chance;
He has just done things by half.
Life&#x27;s been a jolly good joke on him,
And now is the time to laugh.
Ha, ha! He is one of the Legion Lost;
He was never meant to win;
He&#x27;s a rolling stone, and it&#x27;s bred in the bone;

"In 2019 you still cannot get a decent macOS-like modifier key setup on Linux where OS-keys are mapped to Super (e.g. Super-C being copy) and such that Control works like it does on macOS, so I still always find these kinds of articles nice but you&#x27;re in for lots of surprises if you try to switch.<p>And I say this as someone with both macOS and Linux laptops that I work from, but because of the above and other similar things I think you&#x27;re always up for disappointment if you expect to get Linux to be exactly like macOS."
"While this is very good to study before a technical interview, over time however I can see that this alone is going to make it 40x harder to differentiate say 100 candidates that are all perfect at interviews in general, that we are going to start asking ridiculous Oxbridge-style interview questions and expect perfect scores to advance &#x27;good&#x27; candidates.<p>Perhaps companies will start asking candidates to construct mathematical proofs of data structures, algorithms, formulas and common equations from university-level entrance examinations just to do a mobile app or a web dev job.<p>As soon as that happens, the &#x27;ideal candidate&#x27; companies will be expecting to interview would be a very prodigious candidate, former math Olympiad champion and decorated with titles and research papers in their name.<p>You guessed it: 𝔜𝔢 𝔬𝔩𝔡𝔢 𝔩𝔢𝔤𝔢𝔫𝔡 𝔬𝔣 𝔶𝔢 10𝔵 𝔡𝔢𝔳𝔢𝔩𝔬𝔭𝔢𝔯."

"&gt; As the mechanism is unknown, it’s unclear what the actual danger is. Is it some byproduct of the nicotine cartidges, or THC ones? Is it the vapor itself? Is it only at certain temperatures or concentrations? Is it directly affecting the lungs or entering the bloodstream? No one knows yet — all they’ve seen is an sudden uptick in respiratory or pulmonary issues where the sufferer also uses vaping products.<p>We&#x27;ve seen a few studies suggesting certain flavoring agents may cause significant problems, has this been investigated as a possible cause?"

"&gt;As part of our staged release strategy, our current plan is to release the 1558M parameter model in a few months, but it’s plausible that findings from a partner, or malicious usage of our 774M model, could change this.<p>This seems naive but I think it&#x27;s a misdirection. Of course the model will have malicious users. Propaganda teams started testing its integration as soon as it was released. It&#x27;s likely that OpenAI is counting on this for insights into HOW the model can be used maliciously. It&#x27;s also possible that the model results have inherent trackable markers and OpenAI can later say that X% of social media posts were made using this model.<p>So what are the positive applications, aside from prettifying data like sports and weather reports?<p>Even with Skyrim&#x27;s 800+ books, you frequently ran into the same book. Imagine libraries filled with plausible text that hides nuggets of lore seeded by developers. Along with more realistic text-to-speech this can allow games to support a large diversity of NPCs that have true radiant dialogue and sound more realistic than &quot;I saw a mudcrab the other day&quot;.<p>With some modifications, I think models like this can outweigh even their nefarious applications:<p>Defense against text decomposition analysis. The model can be used to obfuscate writing patterns that can reveal a person&#x27;s identity, either by randomizing form or standardizing it. Take your post and run it through the formatter to get the same idea and intent, but in a style that can&#x27;t be traced to your other writing. Or you reform it into style of Ernest Hemmingway, like thousands of others.<p>Realtime plausible deniability encryption. Messages in a monitored chat can look like mundane conversation but contain encrypted messages. This would require the model accept seeds and work partially in reverse to diff two sets of text to reveal the hidden message.<p>In it&#x27;s current form it doesn&#x27;t look like it can do any of those things, but there&#x27;s the potential."

"I just started in a new role a few months ago and was given a new MBP. I used an older one in my last role and loved it, but the new ones I simply can&#x27;t stand. For starters the keyboards feel cheap, I needed 2 - 3 dongles just to plug in all my external monitors, keyboard and mouse. I gave up on the apple mouse since when it dies it&#x27;s belly up due to where the charging cable is, that&#x27;s simply poor design.<p>I was also always swapping out dongles for my monitors as it was 50&#x2F;50 if the monitor would come back online.<p>I could go on and on, but the short of it is I went to our IT team and told them I wanted a Win10 machine. I was the first person, hopefully not the last, to turn in an Apple laptop for a windows, I became an instant legend.<p>TBH, I don&#x27;t miss it at all. I&#x27;ve got WSL and can do everything I did on that MBP on this ThinkPad. It&#x27;s nice to have plenty of ports without ugly dongles and a proper docking station.<p>IMO, Apple&#x27;s lost it since Job&#x27;s passing."

"&gt; Some $2.5 billion worth of subprime loans, those with FICO credit scores below 690, ended up in mortgage bonds in the first quarter of 2019. That is more than double a year earlier and the highest level since the end of 2007, according to Inside Mortgage Finance. There was $1.9 billion worth of subprime mortgage bonds in the second quarter.<p>Statements like this are hard to evaluate without knowing the denominator: the total value of new mortgage bonds in each period.<p>All too often, an author who should know better throws the reader a scrap like the following sentence:<p>&gt; The market for unconventional home loans is still tiny compared with the rest of the mortgage market as well as its precrisis past, when unconventional borrowing peaked at more than $1 trillion.<p>But this still doesn&#x27;t convey what percentage of the loans are to sub-690 FICO borrowers.<p>I see this all the time and wonder to what extent it has contributed to mistrust of the traditional media.<p>If we find out that the percentage in 2019 is 1% but in 2007 it was 56%, that casts the entire story in a different light."

"Also interesting are the jokes that were removed and added.<p>The Lion gets his courage from a bottle in the original (the joke being a reference to a common joke at the time that some people get their courage from a bottle of liquor) But 1939 was so close to the prohibition fiasco, it seems the producers did not like this joke.<p>Likewise, the scene in the field of (presumably opium) poppies that put everyone to sleep was only added in 1939. It&#x27;s hard to imagine that joke being added in, say, the time of height of the war on drugs: could Bart Simpson play with opium poppies and pass out to audience laughter 1980&#x27;s?"

"In numerical analysis, &quot;Hexadecimal float with an exponent&quot; is not an obscure feature, it&#x27;s a really nice one! If you want to communicate to somebody an exact number that your program has output, you need to either tell them the decimal number to enough digits + the number of digits (i.e., &quot;Float32(0.1)&quot;, which is distinct from &quot;Float64(0.1)&quot;), or you can tell them the same number in full precision in binary, in which case the floating-point standard guarantees that that number is exactly correct and does not depend on how you interpret it. It&#x27;s really nice for testing numerical code, especially with automated reproducible tests. Completely unambiguous, and I wish more languages had that (I saw the feature in Julia first)."

"In general, to me it seems like Amazon focuses more on other things than on refining the way their actual store and its site works.<p>They&#x27;ve focused a lot on operations and efficiency. They already had 2-day shipping but they&#x27;ve worked to get that down to 1-day shipping where possible. Which is impressive, though 2-day shipping was already pretty good. They&#x27;ve optimized the hell out of their inventory, distribution, etc. They made that Haven joint-venture healthcare thing (together with two other huge companies) to drive down health insurance costs.<p>Another area they&#x27;ve focused on is new types of business, like cloud computing, buying Whole Foods, getting into video streaming, and hardware devices (Kindle, Fire, Echo).<p>But the store itself, the web site design and how the store functions, hasn&#x27;t changed that much. They had a lot of issues with fake reviews, and they eventually did something, but it took a long time. They have some longstanding usability pain points that they haven&#x27;t done anything about. Reviews are supposed to be about products, not sellers, but people leave comments and ratings about sellers in product reviews because there&#x27;s no other place to put them (or if there is, it&#x27;s not easy enough to find). Something (bad UI?) seems to encourage unhelpful &quot;I don&#x27;t know&quot; type answers in products&#x27; &quot;Customer questions &amp; answers&quot; section. If you click &quot;There is a newer model of this item&quot;, it often leads to something that isn&#x27;t. Product categories and the features within them are insufficient or out of date: I can browse the cell phone case category, but under &quot;phone compatibility&quot;, Galaxy S10 isn&#x27;t listed, only Galaxy S9, even though the S10 came out 6 months ago. Similar story with iPhone. And nothing with size variations of phone models (iPhone XS, XS Max, and XR would require different cases).<p>All of these things would probably benefit everybody if they fixed them. And it&#x27;s not just a matter of adding polish. There are more innovative things they could do, too. But the attitude seems to be that the store is basically as done as it&#x27;s going to get."

"I am sure the author means well. However, this makes little sense from an evolutionary standpoint. Although humans have evolved far more than most animals on this planet, the basic idea of evolutionary biology remains the same. In the wild, males have to hunt (provide food), protect the new born(s) and their mate(s) from threats. Therefore having the same level or higher levels of Testosterone is a biological imperative. Testosterone makes the male stronger and more aggressive. Both are very useful traits from an evolutionary standpoint. I cannot imagine human males diverging too much from this basic framework.<p>Coming to today&#x27;s workplace, after childbirth there is a drop in productivity of male employees as they adjust to their new reality. However, I have observed men become more diligent and aggressive at their jobs. I only imagine thats because they have a stronger sense of responsibility to provide for their partner &amp; offspring. Whether or not Testosterone levels change is a different matter."

"It&#x27;s true that, as demonstrated, const-qualifying your pointer arguments is very unlikely to allow any optimisations on its own.<p>However, const-qualifying your pointer arguments where the pointed-to object isn&#x27;t changed is what allows you to make more liberal use of const-qualified <i>declarations</i>, and as also demonstrated by the article, those in turn do allow some optimisations.<p>Additionally, there is some safety on the table: if your C program makes use of pointers to structures full of function pointers to implement polymorphism, making those pointers const-qualified allows your underlying structures full of function pointers to be declared const, which in turn allows them to be stored in hardware-enforced read-only memory.<p>As a side note, I&#x27;ve often thought that block-scope variables declared const and whose address is never taken should be automatically made static."

One thing I did that helped me improve a lot was to start using a pen with a smaller point.  This required greater precision to connect stroke.

"As a resident, Seattle&#x27;s drug policy seems okay. I think the goal of harm reduction, trust building, and getting people back on track is a laudable goal. People need a pathway back, not to keep being kicked down.<p>But we need higher standards about the anti-social behaviors that are comorbid to drug use. The problem isn&#x27;t that people are on narcotics. It&#x27;s at least _possible_ to be a functional member of society while on opiates, and I don&#x27;t think someone should be wrung through the legal system for having the wrong things in their blood for a bit.<p>The problem is tent cities burning trash under the overpass. Lines of disheveled camper vans near the shopping centers draining their sewage into open buckets on the street (thank god they&#x27;re kind enough to use a bucket) Panhandlers harassing residents at such scale that all but the most resilient citizens grimace at the thought of walking through their city center. Some of these people seem not to have drug problems at all.<p>I&#x27;m okay with low standards about drug policy enforcement, so long as it&#x27;s coupled with high standards about behavior in the public space.<p>It&#x27;s the second half that Seattle has yet to solve."

"Optics aside, it seems like the obvious solution is to give people a free supply of safe drugs and a safe place to use them.<p>Drug users would be better off because their supply would be safe and they wouldn&#x27;t need to resort to crime to pay for it. Current supervised consumption sites have also been extremely successful at preventing overdose deaths and somewhat successful at directing users who want treatment to the available resources.<p>The public would be better off because of the same crime reduction, as well as the reduction of violence and disorder stemming from black markets for illegal drugs. Public use would become so much more of a hassle than the legal alternative that it would likely disappear.<p>The government would be better off because acquiring currently-illegal drugs legally is super cheap (most of them literally grow on trees, or at least plants), and is almost certainly vastly cheaper than the current prohibition strategy.<p>The obvious problems:<p>- No one is going to want a consumption site anywhere near their neighborhood. 
- Some number of people who would otherwise quit might continue to use if it were cheap and easy.
- Something along the lines of &quot;I&#x27;d love to sit around all day watching TV and drinking beer but I have bills to pay and I don&#x27;t want my taxes paying for some low-life to get high.&quot;"

"In Brazil, the local mail charges R$ 15 (~US$ 4) to deliver international packages from &quot;certain countries&quot; i.e. China. The result is, ultra-cheap freight has almost disappeared, most sites like AliExpress now charge around US$ 4, but the class of this kind of package is not charged again here, so it is still kind of cheap.<p>OTOH mail from USA is damn expensive. I don&#x27;t buy more things from USA because of this. And local customs tend to target USA packages more so the chance of paying import tax is way higher, too. Even packages from Europe and Japan are cheaper, and one can see they are more distant places."

"TL;DR: a very entry-level article about the field of popgen (&quot;what is a genome?&quot;) and how the &quot;breakthrough&quot; is representing multiple sequence alignments as compact binary matrices. There&#x27;s very little explanation or actual examples beyond that, so unless you&#x27;re a complete layman the article probably won&#x27;t satiate you.<p>Applying deep learning to genomic data is something of a fad these days - the bioinformatics world has caught up with the DL hype of the early 2010s and is trying to use DL on nearly anything that moves for easy papers.<p>The main issue with DL frameworks in the context of genomics is the format of input data. You pretty much want all your data to be a matrix of fixed size (if you want to use CNNs at least, and that&#x27;s what everyone is interested in anyway), but that&#x27;s just not how genomics data works. Sequences vary in length (I see the problems of nucleotide gaps, let alone short indels is left unanswered), alignments are not absolute (they are very much aligner dependent and secondary alignments are a thing), the alignments themselves may stem from different data sources (long reads cover more stretches of DNA but are less reliable than short ones), there is no mention of how ploidy is handled (especially in plants!) and somehow you&#x27;re supposed to transform all of that into a neat 48x48 array to feed to Keras. Wait, thousands of them. Did I mention the human or plant genomes are often billions of basepairs long? Waiting for bwa to be done mapping on your cluster is the xkcd equivalent of &quot;can&#x27;t do work, compiling!&quot;<p>So yeah, sorry to put a damper on this but I&#x27;m waiting for something within the reach of practical workability (and believe me the standards of bioinformaticians for workable stuff are <i>low</i>) before getting hyped."

"I&#x27;m sorry but Perl 6 isnt relevant IMO. It took too long. I was a Perl developer at etoys.com in 2000 and BBC in 2001. I wrote OneMusic for Radio1 and even convinced the BBCs uptight ops team to run it with modperl so it could handle the high traffic it did. I also created the job search engine WorkZoo in modperl, one of Time Magazines top 50 sites of 2005 and Indeed&#x27;s main competitor at the time.<p>Perl6 was promised. Then it never happened. It&#x27;s now an almost quarter century later. The world has moved on. Taking that long for a single version update in a language is not reasonable. I loved Perl. I still love Perl5. But I&#x27;ve moved on and have 100% blocked Perl6 from my psyche and list of expectations. No one I know uses it. I am not excited by it. I dont need it. And I don&#x27;t care to hear these discussions about minutia related to it. It&#x27;s a debacle and a case study in the failure of what was a beautifully ugly practical performant language."

"There is a big gap between &quot;crap&quot; and AAA for sure. But think about this (in today&#x27;s time):<p>* Half Life 2 looks like crap<p>* Fallout 3 looks like crap<p>* Actually any game from more than a few years back, looks like crap<p>But any of those are hopelessly out of reach for any Indie developer even with today&#x27;s tools.<p>There is real AAA from earlier days, that still looks good these days, like:<p>* Battlefield 3<p>* Crysis 2<p>* Call Of Duty Modern Warfare<p>* etc.<p>But these games have among the highest budget in history of game development and a respectable revenue stream...<p>What the author is trying to say is that most people think most games looks like crap (I think so too). There is no point in making AA games (let&#x27;s assume he didn&#x27;t mean actual AAA games) as an Indie developer, because people will still think your game looks like crap. And those people who don&#x27;t (I for instance really like SNES games still), will also be satisfied with the art he can create.<p>Let&#x27;s look at Anno 1602 vs. Anno 1800. This is more in the domain of the author. I really like both games and I have to say, Anno 1800 has AMAZING graphics. But the game gets boring after playing it one time to the Investor level... Anno 1602 has graphics that you can probably manage as an Indie developer these days (since you don&#x27;t need to optimize it at all and have much better tooling). This game never gets old ;). I have more fun playing that one than Anno 1800. Which is another reason why AAA graphics is unneeded. You need shiny graphics if your game sucks. And creating games that suck is what todays AAA industry is all about."

The analogy given in the article is interesting. Some organisms perform certain actions even before they start to learn. I myself have seen some animals start running immediately after birth. Less number of parameters (shared parameters) could also be thought of as less complexity and hence less processing power requirements; which implies faster training. Phew! too much similarity.
"one thing that makes this difficult on the internet is that people seem to assume you are arguing with them by default. I&#x27;ve noticed that I tend to get an argumentative followup even if I am agreeing with the OP unless I explicitly state at the beginning that I agree.<p>I suspect that the very structure of voting-based comment sections intensifies this. if you actually follow the etiquette, you upvote posts you agree with instead of leaving a comment to say so. on the other hand, you are <i>not</i> supposed to downvote comments you disagree with. this probably tips the balance enough to make the median comment be a rebuttal to OP. of course, people sometimes respond with supplemental information, but people either twist this to interpret it as an argument or take it as an implicit critique of OP for not including all the relevant information.<p>in the end, I don&#x27;t really have any advice for you; I think it&#x27;s just inherent to the medium. I personally enjoy arguing a lot, but many people I know irl do not. so I just accept the internet for what it is and get my arguing fix here and stick to lighter topics irl."

We had wandered amongst protesters up one street, just taking it all in (up to exciting but short of dangerous!), when suddenly masked protesters came running towards us, gas clouds and popping sounds behind them. We ducked first into the alcove doorway of a restaurant and then sheltered inside at the bar for the evening eating tapas. Within the restaurant, fairly normal dining. Across the road, police with shields dealing with rioters and damaged property."

"The worst part is that I can tell this keyboard is actually having a detrimental effect on my typing abilities. Since being on these keyboards for years now, I&#x27;ve noticed that my typing speed has slowed, as I spend a significant amount of cognitive energy preparing to fix mistakes. The faster you type, the more annoying it is to go farther back to fix something. I&#x27;m not sure how to quantify the focus it steals from tasks or the anxiety it gives me, but I think they are also real.

"The important part about implementing something like the great firewall, or how Iran runs the Internet (All ISPs need to be downstream of the government-run ASN), is that you need cooperation from the people with network engineering talent.<p>If all of them refuse to help implement your new internet censorship regime, it&#x27;s a problem for any authoritarian government, just as much as if your police force stops following orders. You can start firing people and hiring replacements who will toe the line, but at a certain point you&#x27;re going to end up with second and third rate talent, and correspondingly shoddy ISPs.<p>Talented network engineers such as those who have the equivalent of &#x27;enable&#x27; on the twenty largest ISPs in HK can choose to go elsewhere and work in free countries. There&#x27;s sufficient demand for their skills that refusing en masse to cooperate is not an incredible risk for them.<p>I work in the field and try to teach junior NOC people that there is such a thing as ethics in network engineering. Just as there is in any other professional field where people rely upon critical systems. This means, among other things, don&#x27;t try to MITM your customers&#x27; traffic (Kazakhstan, recent incident comes to mind), don&#x27;t get into intrusive DPI, don&#x27;t fuck with neutrality of content, and absolutely never cooperate with anything that slightly resembles the great firewall. The combination of modern technology&#x2F;human tracking systems plus full autocratic state control of ISPs could result in something that would be the wet dream of east germany&#x27;s Stasi."

"While arguments in the blogpost are mostly compelling (perhaps the most important to me is Jet&#x2F;Turbo being far more high-contrast in the &quot;colder&quot; regions), I see Inferno as vastly superior still, mostly for the same reasons it was superior to Jet. All these colormaps are intended to represent one-dimensional gradient, as in &quot;from hot to cold&quot; and it is completely obvious when looking at Inferno. Jet &amp; Turbo give a false impression of non-one-dimensionality. It <i>might</i> be a matter of being used to the colormap in question, but Jet is as old and common as it gets, and it still is not self-evident to me that the dark red is hotter than the very light yellow. I mean, obviously I <i>know</i> that, but I will tell you instantly without thinking what is the hottest and coldest regions on Inferno image, and I am significantly more likely to make a mistake when I&#x27;m tired with the Jet (and, presumably Turbo — for the same reasons)."

"I’m going to comment with what seems to be the common sentiment here.  It’s really hard to tell how effective a helmet is at preventing concussions in real life.  So we&#x2F;they design a test of some hypothetical concussion cause, and lo and behold, their helmet is very effective in that test.  Note that this is a different test than the ones used to prove that MIPS was better than a styrofoam helmet.<p>The real story is that marketing probably has a bigger influence than science in this case.  Several years ago helmet manufacturers hit the practical weight limit for helmets with styrofoam and carbon fiber shells.  I bought a Giro Atmos over a decade ago and never needed to upgrade because the top of the line helmets were only a couple grams lighter, after a decade of “improvement.”  The manufacturers noticed that helmet sales were declining, and all of a sudden “new science” appeared with a theory about concussions being caused by brain rotation and MIPS technology helps prevent that.  How convenient that this appeared.<p>The dirty secret is that literally nobody has ever seen a brain rotate inside a skull and result in concussion.  It’s really hard to image a brain in motion (impossible with off the shelf equipment), so the brain rotation theory is just a hypothetical mechanism.  There isn’t an ethical test for blunt force trauma in real life conditions, and bike crashes are very rarely reported if they don’t send the rider to the hospital.  So the leading authority on product safety, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, doesn’t even have good numbers on concussion rates for cyclists.<p>The bottom line is that MIPS and this new gel layer came at way too good of a time for the helmet industry for us not to be wary of the science.  They can get away with it because it’s such an easy marketing sell- most people think their life is worth more than $250, so any helmet tech is a bet on the order of Pascal’s wager.  If it’s snake oil I’m just out $250, but if it really is better then I just saved my life in a crash."

The emphasis on computational power also makes no sense to me.  If we had infinite compute <i>today</i>, what steps would you take to build AGI?  Does anyone have any good ideas about that?<p>Sometimes I wonder if AGI (and the concept of a &quot;technological singularity&quot;) isn&#x27;t just &quot;intelligent design for people with north of 140 IQ&quot;.

"To me this is more than a philosophical point, more than an engineering issue for AI, it&#x27;s a current item of human life.  The real world (and I am including Nature in the term) is our model for health and sanity.  As computer-mediated reality becomes more and more the norm, we risk disconnection from our own embodiment.<p>How much time do you spend in front of a screen?  How much of your existence is mediated already?  I just tried VR goggles the other day, and thank God they give you headaches because people are going to try to live in there if it&#x27;s ever physically possible.  (Reminds me of the guy I knew who lived IRL on my friend&#x27;s couch and played Second Life all day.  He had a great second life but no first life.)<p>One other thing about being embodied: you die."
"What makes any one think that taking away parking will increase poor people housing?  That seems to be the biggest shortage.  Why would I turn my parking into housing I run at a low profit or even a loss, rather than up-scale luxury housing?  I can make more money off that.  And forcing a certain number of units of poor housing will only decrease supply further.  I have yet to see evidence to the contrary.<p>Secondly, there are cities where aught but driving is not practical.  See Houston; when I lived there, I had to drive often one-hundred-fifty miles per day to different places.  There is also no one center; I may have one client in the woodlands, one in Bellaire, one in Sugarland, one in the Ship Channel.  How do you propose to fix this?  it is too big and too dense for the traditional &quot;hub-and-spoke&quot; model to work, too hot for scooters or bicycles (it regularly hits one-hundred-five degrees this time of year)."

"&gt;The reason for this likely elevated status is because we can now say that anamensis and afarensis actually overlapped in time.<p>This seems to be the rule, rather than the other exception, at least in human evolution. Erectus overlapped with more modern archaics, for example. Habilis overlapped with afarensis.<p>A lot of these are more about the semantics than the substance. Words like &quot;species&quot; get tricky, when you&#x27;re dealing with chronspecies, introgression and such.<p>In any case, our evolution since speciating from chimps is extremely bushy. There are lots of species, and several families. The process involved lots of  innovation&#x2F;speciation and extinctions. Ie, The australopithecine family that this species may have founded produced many species, including at least two that formed their own families with multiple species of their own (paranthropous &amp; homo).<p>I think this is characteristic of fast evolutionary processes."

Envoy is more than capable of underpinning api gateway and service mesh. They are different applications of the same technologies. The difference in north&#x2F;south and east&#x2F;west traffic is not nearly as distinct as other commenters are saying. The biggest change is that clients in an east&#x2F;west transaction have the capability to do mTLS and connect to multiple backends natively without using DNS. The other big change is that the requests flowing from north&#x2F;south are inherently less secure than east&#x2F;west traffic since they originate from a third party.<p>API Gateways are a feature of Service Meshes which allows end-users to access services through web browsers which have less sophisticated protocols for authentication and service discovery.

"A few thoughts:<p>(1) Most open source projects do not provide the outsized value impact that their creators seem to think they do. Most projects exist around the realm of &quot;its 20% easier to install this than build it ourselves, so lets grab the dependency&quot;. That&#x27;s nice, but lets be clear here: Standard.JS is not building Rails, or NodeJS, or Express, or React, or another <i>seriously</i> valuable project that saves companies thousands of dollars.<p>(2) Open source maintainers are deathly afraid of restrictive licensing. That could mean GPL, or it could mean a straight-up enterprise &quot;pay for a key&quot; licensing. I think these are <i>fantastic</i> ways to level the field between individual OSS devs and billion dollar companies, because most billion dollar companies take licensing very seriously. Where does this fear come from? I think a big part is that these OSS devs &quot;want their cake and to eat it&quot;; they want the ego and community of an altruist, but the income of a Capitalist. Another component is point (1); if you really tried to place a number on the value of their project, they&#x27;d be disappointed with the number customers would quote. They don&#x27;t want to find out what that number is; they&#x27;d rather just ask for donations (of which they get very little, because, again, this software by-and-large does not provide outsized value).<p>(3) Its crazy to me that companies would pay for advertising space in an npm install script. I&#x27;d bet developers behind projects like StandardJS went to these companies and said &quot;look we get millions of installs every month, that&#x27;s millions of impressions&quot;, and I <i>hope</i> the companies are smart enough to know that (A) the vast majority of those installs are in unmonitored CI scripts, and (B) even if they are local, the text flies by so quick, and (C) even if they aren&#x27;t quick, no one watches that progress anyway. Even if there&#x27;s no deception today, one can easily see that monitoring &quot;impressions&quot; here is very difficult, and thus its very difficult to place a quantitative value on that ad space.<p>(4) The inability to sustain yourself on open-source development is about equivalent to &quot;I can&#x27;t sustain myself on volunteering time at a food kitchen for the homeless.&quot; If you&#x27;re actually having funding problems to live your life, its time to reassess. Again, this sounds like some of these projects have some egotists behind them, or maybe they just feel like they can&#x27;t leave (hint: you can. you&#x27;re human. your priority is you. not the billion dollar companies who use your software without paying). Find help. Take a break. See if your full-time company can &quot;sponsor&quot; development by letting you work on it 5% of the time."

"I&#x27;ve been wondering, how closely could a future&#x2F;alien civilization recreate Magic the Gathering&#x27;s rules given nothing but a collection that included every card and several (100? 1000?) valid decks for different formats.<p>I imagine they could get fairly close, especially thanks to reminder text.

On top of that, the golden rule of Magic is that if a card and the rules disagree, the card takes precedence.  And there are over 20,000 unique named cards, though a small number are functionally the same card as another with a different name.<p>See this link for the comprehensive rules, but note that the vast, vast majority of games don&#x27;t require an exhaustive understanding.

"In my view, the predominant mistake made by those who seek to create profitable strategies is that they approach trading as if the market is a zero-sum game.  In particular, doing things that harm the markets, like naively adding to existing momentum, is just promoting price overshoot and instability by reinforcing positive feedback loops.  Such approaches hurt others and while they might make money for long periods of time, they will almost surely end up losing all that profit and more during a small number of extreme market events.<p>If you want to be reliably profitable, you need to first understand how the markets are not a zero-sum game and then you need to construct methods to improve the markets with your trading.  There are countless ways that markets deviate from truly efficient behavior.  Find some and develop strategies in areas that can benefit from your cognitive, experiential, and educational strengths.  General examples of how one might improve the markets include things like providing liquidity when it&#x27;s needed, limiting price overshoots when it&#x27;s warranted, and incorporating new information about instrument values. The market will pay you in return if you do such things in a sound way.  As long as you also do a good job of estimating and limiting your risk, you can be consistently profitable.<p>There will be no significant public disclosures of detailed ways to trade profitably.  The markets rely on the robustness provided by many different points of view addressing market needs in a variety of ways.  Any parties that overweight one of those points of view will ultimately lose money in the process of adding market instability.  There&#x27;s too much of that already.  Don&#x27;t trade until you figure out how to make the markets better."

"Having recently finished &quot;Hillbilly Elegy,&quot; this interview reminded me of similar themes. America doesn&#x27;t really have a meaningful discourse on class I suspect because the Soviet machine dominated it for so long it became a kind of third-rail topic.<p>If you are from a working class background, or find yourself navigating it, what you notice about people who have left it is they leave behind that very &quot;dignity,&quot; (or honour) that defines working people. They become placeless, &quot;political,&quot;  &quot;from anywhere,&quot; as opposed to &quot;from somewhere.&quot;[1] It&#x27;s because an elite education broadens your perspective so that the symbols and things you previously thought were meaningful and powerful don&#x27;t figure in with the same significance when you see the bigger picture of possibilities. What working people treat as a localized cultural dignity can seem like superstition when viewed against much greater power in a global context and perspective. This dignity is still important, but higher education &quot;pops,&quot; you out of that view.<p>The side effect (or cause of problems) of this is that today, even the most elite institutions do not create enough cultural distance between working people and the new administrators, and so you have this insecure burgher class in America who define themselves with displays of contempt for &quot;white trash,&quot; &quot;rednecks,&quot; etc, because even their advanced education and high paying jobs (or cultural capital) do not provide them with enough distance and certainty that they are in fact sufficiently different, that working people wouldn&#x27;t even register as a threat to their identity.<p>The reason a &quot;noble,&quot; person can treat people equally is because there is absolutely no danger of the association harming their identity and position. It&#x27;s also why country people can seem extra egalitarian, because they just don&#x27;t have a stake in the affectations of city class navigation.<p>You can also see how the most militant critics of working class values and of the underclasses&#x27; dignity systems and honour codes are the people who most closely resemble them, or perceive they are only a few paychecks away from them: &quot;artists,&quot; with middling if any higher education, unionized workers, city dwellers with precarious culture and media jobs. The lower middle who need to distinguish themselves and work harder so they don&#x27;t lose, &quot;everything,&quot; and be reduced to those people they are trying so hard to separate themselves from. On the upper end, there is a kind of haughty mystification at why anyone would actually fear wearing red or blue in certain neighbourhoods, but when they say they don&#x27;t understand, what they mean is they don&#x27;t need to.<p>This negative cycle of downward class anxiety and neuroticism from the new middle just provokes entrenchment of working tribe values and reactionary views, and you get the culture wars of today. America&#x27;s new elite is not exceptionally elite by historical standards, and it knows it, and their impostor syndrome is expressed mainly as contempt for an underclass and the scapegoating of working class people.<p>The solutions are more complex, but the problem seems stark as day.<p>[1] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;books&#x2F;2017&#x2F;mar&#x2F;22&#x2F;the-road-to-somewhere-david-goodhart-populist-revolt-future-politics"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;books&#x2F;2017&#x2F;mar&#x2F;22&#x2F;the-road-to-so...</a>"

"I&#x27;ve done 2 commercial Typescript + React projects so far (along with few side projects using what I knew that time + what I want to try).

I think it as the &#x27;technical debt spelled out&#x27;: when you want to put down an &#x27;any&#x27; and get on with what you&#x27;re doing, by all mean, but remember its existence and make sure the team is well aware. If the usage going to persist (example, using a library without @type), then you treat it as JS and have appropriate amount of validation around the occurrence.<p>- Usage of &quot;?&quot; and &quot;!&quot; covers more scopes with less lines of code. For hobby&#x2F;one-man project, I found their usages no-brainer, however I&#x27;m nervous when it comes working in a team of various experience level.<p>- I&#x27;ve had real headache typing API responses. On one hand, you have absolute no control of others&#x27; code quality that you might as well have &quot;number | string | null | undefined&quot; for all parameters.

"Went into the data and took the top 1000 individuals with self cite percentages over 40%, then sorted by institution.  Nearly every major institution had individuals in this group: Johns Hopkins (4), Cal Tech (4), Georgia Tech (2), MIT (5), each of the Max Planck Institute campuses (3-7), Moscow State (7), Penn State (6), Stanford (1), Utrecht (2), University of Zurich (4), ETH Zurich (1), DLR (3), Imperial College London (3), University of Tokyo (2), Princeton (5), Kyoto University (4)...<p>I feel like if this problem were very concerning we&#x27;d see the distribution concentrated at certain institutions but I&#x27;m not sure there&#x27;s one with over 10 researchers at them.  We hear a lot about questionable Chinese journals, but the highest institution in this list is the Chinese Academy of Sciences with 3 individuals.<p>I think the more likely case is there are a few bad apples, some bad practices we can&#x27;t ever fully get rid of, and that some research lends itself more to self-citation."

"What&#x27;s HN&#x27;s stance on publishers posting links directly to HN?<p>To be clear, this isn&#x27;t meant as a blast against The Information or ballmers_peak; they&#x27;re transparent about their affiliation and that this is an article white listed for readers referred by Hacker News. It&#x27;s also a totally appropriate article for HN.<p>That said, I kind of wish there was some in-line indicator of a motivated submission source. I guess a downside would be unethical publishers just laundering their submissions through ostensibly unaffiliated accounts, but I&#x27;d feel more comfortable knowing that we did have some kind of system here to encourage transparency."
If anyone is in or around Arkansas it is a fun place to visit especially with kids.  For a small price of admission you get to go onto the property and dig around in the dirt as much as you want.  There are people in the area that do it as a hobby bringing shovels and 5-gallon buckets to see what they can find.  A park ranger told us the same thing from the article that the best time to find diamonds is right after a large rainfall when the ground shifts and diamonds can be seen on the surface in the sunlight.
"This is an attempt to push Lyft out of CA by raising the cost side of the equation but that cost will eventually have to be passed to riders, which will dramatically drop demand. If the minimum wage law passes and they subsidize rides long enough to edge out Lyft then they finally get the monopoly they’ve been promising investors for the last decade but they also lose a huge amount of their TAM. The laws of supply and demand will eventually come into play.<p>And of course once they get their monopoly they will raise prices further to get profits and at that point I’d guess they would only be slightly less expensive then Taxis were before all this gig economy craziness."

But that variability would be smoothed due to it being printed continuously at the angular offset from horizontal."
"Interesting that they went with a 32bit ISA, given the growth and demand for ML&#x2F;AI, which seems to lean upon lower precision (8bit), then I wonder if they could of gone for that instead of something more a jack of all trades design.<p>Which makes me wonder, when will somebody do an ISA dedicated for ML&#x2F;AI and will we ever see old 8bit CPU&#x27;s reborn as on memory CPU&#x27;s.<p>But we have seen this approach for processing upon memory before and whilst that has not tractioned into a product, this might.

So much commentary on this quote and no one mentions a possible link to LSD as inspiration? It&#x27;s taboo to say it because the subject matter is illegal. But this is honestly one of the most psychedelic-sounding Steve Jobs quotes I can think of.
"Matt Levine&#x27;s take (sorry Matt for the long excerpt):<p><a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bloomberg.com&#x2F;opinion&#x2F;articles&#x2F;2019-08-19&#x2F;we-looks-out-for-our-selves"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bloomberg.com&#x2F;opinion&#x2F;articles&#x2F;2019-08-19&#x2F;we-loo...</a><p>The managers and the board, in this version of the corporation, are the only ones representing all of the constituencies, so they are the only ones qualified to evaluate their own performance. If an activist shareholder comes in and says “we should replace the board because performance is bad,” the board and the CEO can respond “no you are just saying that as a greedy shareholder and we shouldn’t listen to you.”<p>Another way to put it is that the corporation really does have to serve many different stakeholders, but in practice most disputes over corporate governance are not between shareholders and employees or shareholders and polluted watersheds, but between shareholders and managers. And these disputes tend to follow a stereotyped pattern in which disgruntled shareholders say “the stock price is low” and the managers say “ah but in the long term it will be high.” Because—on the agency-cost view—it is just harder to measure the long term (since it hasn’t happened yet), so you can’t hold the managers to it. Similarly, if managers can respond “ah but the stock price is low because we are serving other constituencies,” that gives them another argument against the shareholders.<p>... So when an association of big public-company CEOs gets together and declares that corporations should serve the community, take care of the environment, and be responsible to employees and customers, not just shareholders, that might be because the CEOs have thought it over and decided that employees and the environment are getting a raw deal, but it is also possible that the CEOs have thought it over and decided that shareholders are annoying."
"“Productivity” means something very different for assembly line workers than it does for retail workers. As productivity has improved over time, we actually have seen the expected reduction of hours, but it varies by occupation. A much smaller number of people work in manufacturing now, while the ranks of retail and white collar workers have grown. People are moving towards occupations where “productivity” is harder to gauge and not necessarily the most important metric at all times. The increase in productivity in some sectors and the migration of workers to new sectors are broadly related, too, since the former requires technological advance, which is the result of cognitive work and creates more need for white collar and cognitive work."

"I&#x27;d love to see some metrics on whether this idea has any merit. Because obviously any problem that can be done on a massive wafer can be done on multiple smaller wafers. The question is, are the compromises to get something working on a massive wafer killing performance to the point where just splitting the problem up efficiently would have been better. It&#x27;s also important to think: Stuff isn&#x27;t just going to happen to be the size to fit on this wafer, it&#x27;s either huge in scale, or not. If it&#x27;s not, you don&#x27;t need this wafer, if it is, you probably need to partition your problem onto multiple copies of this wafer anyway. Take their comparison to a Nvidia GPU. It might be 57 times bigger, but I can rent 1000 Nvidia GPUs from AWS at the drop of a hat (more or less).<p>So yes, maybe they&#x27;ve done some interesting stuff, but they need some decent benchmarks to show off before we can really distinguish between whether this is the Boeing 747 Dreamliner or a Spruce Goose."
"I recommend multiple layers. Why? Because some devices&#x2F;apps will circumvent one of these layers one way or another.<p>I use Pi-Hole plus WireGuard to route all my devices through my home broadband connection (so even on a hotel&#x2F;train WiFi, when on LTE, etc). I forward it to Unbound which uses DNSSEC and DNSCrypt. I&#x27;m using an EdgeRouter Lite for that purpose. It does add a little bit of latency, but I don&#x27;t mind, as it also increases my privacy on the insecure link. It also works on say a smart TV or an official Android device (I use a rooted Android device with microG which doesn&#x27;t implement GAds). My partner sees barely any ads at home due to this setup (I did not bother to setup WireGuard on her smartphone as of yet).<p>On each individual client device I also use a layer 7 firewall (&quot;personal firewall&quot;). On macOS I use Little Snitch and LuLu. On Linux I use OpenSnitch. I don&#x27;t use Windows, but if I would I&#x27;d at least remove all the tracking stuff (for example with O&amp;O ShutUp). On Android, I don&#x27;t use a layer 7 firewall which is my bad.<p>For browser, on every OS I use a configured Firefox (which I did NOT document; my bad!) with a bunch of addons. uBlock Origin (mainly to manually block &quot;you are blocking ads&quot; notices). I use uMatrix, Cookie AutoDelete, Smart Referer, Privacy Badger, Decentraleyes, HTTPS Everywhere, containers for Amazon&#x2F;Facebook&#x2F;Google (would like to add Microsoft), CanvasBlocker, Tracking Token Stripper, Forget Me Not, Terms of Service; Didn’t Read, and Buster: Captcha Solver for Humans.<p>uMatrix <i>will</i> break the web. However it is more user-friendly than NoScript ever was. You are going to have to configure such. For websites you regularly use, you can save the temporary changes, or just not use such bloated websites.

"Throughout my rather limited career (~7 years, 4 different companies) I am yet to encounter an actually beneficial (to the project) architect.

From my perspective, if you claim a thing like this, you definitely <i>should</i> be able to handle a minor spike in traffic.<p>Now, it also might be that author has nothing to do with the organization and hence not responsible for the website performance. However, this is also not true: &quot;&lt;AUTHOR&gt; is a senior member of the technical staff and Principal Systems Engineer at the SEI...&quot;, as stated on their bio page.

"&gt; the oldest known board game is an Egyptian game that dates back to 3100 BCE called Senet. “We almost never have the rules for these early games,” Browne said. “The rules have never been recorded, so our knowledge is largely based on historian’s reconstructions.”<p>I live near the Rosicrucian Egyptian Museum in San Jose, CA.

"The whole discussion of typed vs untyped is stupid. Types and structures are all around us (albeit simple or infinitely complex, eg inductive vs coinductive). It is rather a discussion about typesystems that check type constraints immediately before shipping and&#x2F;or after shipping while running the program. Without a proper typesystem  the programmer has to check the types in his mind, or the end user gets a runtime error.
For small hacks or prototyping type checking is not really required because of low overhead. But in non trivial larger, long running systems with a lot of maintenance the cognitive overhead is too big to not use a typechecker. Even if you decompose in microservices or microfrontends you still stuff like schema definitions and IDLs. Even hardcore ecmascript evangelists use linters extensively before shipping (potatoe&#x2F;potato linter&#x2F;typechecker)..."

"I wonder what the life of the aircraft needs to be before the higher cost of the aircraft amortises into lower overall costs. I&#x27;d imagine that the running cost of a mainly solid state aircraft is significantly lower than a gasoline one, but the initial battery cost will be very significant. It would be nice if the rise of electric general aviation has the effect of reducing the cost of flying.<p>However, I suspect then you&#x27;ll run into other issues. I can&#x27;t imagine LA can have too many air taxis flying around before they become a nightmare to manage. If the hourly cost of an air taxi is low enough that everyone can take one, the sky will become saturated. There&#x27;s obviously a lot of space, but our systems for managing air traffic right now are designed around there being tens to hundreds of aircraft in the same area, not thousands. We&#x27;d need to introduce fully automated aircraft routing to have a hope of dealing with air taxis over dense cities if they became remotely popular."

"If I was to visualize a Venn Diagram of people who write articles such as this on mit.edu and the people reading them, and my other circle being people who get the short end of the stick of capitalism, I see very little overlap.<p>It&#x27;s true there are skilled workers that love what they do, and their jobs allow them to exert influence -- so they are motivated to work long hours (versus, say, a worker assembling widgets on a factory line).<p>Something about that dichotomy of the people who have the luxury of choosing how much to work, writing about how we work longer, is something I find interesting. The management class of workers are the ones who have the most influence on the working hours of an organization&#x27;s individual contributors."
"I&#x27;m keen to have a look. I&#x27;ve been frustrated with other tools because they&#x27;re too focused on splitting everything into identical monthly budgets when that&#x27;s really not how finances work IRL:<p>1) My driver&#x27;s license costs $150 to renew once every 5 years - I don&#x27;t want to split that into 60 monthly allocations of $2.50 and end up having over $100 sitting in my account for an expense that&#x27;s still not due for over a year. I just want a tool that knows what expenses are coming up over the next 3&#x2F;6&#x2F;12 months and let me know if it thinks I&#x27;m going to overdraw my account. $150 is actually really easy to scrape together when you have 6 months notice that you&#x27;re going to be short.<p>2) I spend $100 on public transport every 2nd Thursday because I get paid every 2nd Thursday. That means either $200&#x2F;month or $300&#x2F;month depending how many Thursdays fall inside the calendar month, and whether they&#x27;re actually the Thursdays that I get paid on. Having a monthly budget that allocates $217&#x2F;month on public transport (because that&#x27;s the monthly average) makes me set aside $17 most months unnecessarily, or possibly leave me short $83 and unable to get to work if I spend the remainder."
"Oh neat. I recently spent a good bit of time comparing different formal proof systems. The Mizar project [0] is pretty interesting since it&#x27;s proofs look a lot like standard proofs in the literature.<p>However, at the moment I&#x27;m a bit enamored with Metamath [1]. It&#x27;s basically a tiny system that just performs formal substitution. Everything else, including propositional calculus, predicate logic, and ZFC set theory is encoded within the language, rather than the implementation. I.e. it&#x27;s a metalogic that only knows about simple substitution. That way one can easily investigate other logics and axiom systems, e.g. they have stuff for intuitionist logics, orthomodular lattice models, you name it.<p>Anyway, the project already has a pretty substantial collection of theorems, including a lot of analysis, topology, algebra and even QM. The cool thing is that you can easily dig up how the high level proofs trace back to the fundamental axioms, and there&#x27;s no fancy math happening in the metalogic at all.<p>Super cool stuff.<p>[0]:<a href=""http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mizar.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mizar.org</a>

"Buying a car with too many software bells and whistles is a good way to buy a car that will look old within just a few years. The software built by the car companies is almost never updated in a major way. I remember when built-in GPS was an option for $1-2k extra on a new car... Five years later and the built in GPS interface looks <i>ancient</i>, and isn&#x27;t nearly as functional as just using your phone anyway. I&#x27;ll take a phone mounted to the dashboard over built-in GPS any day.<p>Every car company should provide some basics, like bluetooth connectivity, but aside from that, Android Auto and Apple Carplay are the ways to go.

"I am a professional engine mechanic by trade, however during my apprenticeship I worked at a luxury dealership so these complains are painfully familiar to me.

Its not whether they get good financing, or whether they get options, its whether or not its <i>serviced.</i><p>&gt;but I’m equally sure I’d be charged some outrageous fee for that “service”.<p>You see, actual luxury vehicle owners do not question the price at all.  They dont see anything other than the signature box on the invoice.  You could for example as I have, charge $190 just to replace the light in the glovebox, and they wouldnt think twice about that amount of money.  I was once faced with a BMW owner looking at seven thousand dollars to replace their electronic air-ride suspension, and the hardest decision they had to make was whether they should buy <i>another</i> BMW while this one was being serviced.<p>Luxury owners rarely see opulence as anything more than a disposable commodity.  If they dont like the apps, or if they dont like the stereo, they just buy a different car.

"Molten salt oxidation.<p>Essentially you &quot;burn&quot; the waste within a molten salt bath and get &quot;synthesis gas&quot; (mix of CO and H2) out.  <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Syngas"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Syngas</a>  Feed that through a water column to get CO2 and more H2, send the CO2 to greenhouses or algae and the H2 to fuel cells.<p>&gt; Molten salt oxidation is a non-flame, thermal process that destroys all organic materials while simultaneously retaining inorganic and hazardous components in the melt. It is used as either hazardous waste treatment(with air) or energy harvesting similar to coal and wood gasification(with steam). The molten salt of choice has been sodium carbonate (m.p 851°C), but other salts can be used. Sulfur, halogens, phosphorus and similar volatile pollutants are oxidized and retained in the melt. Most organic carbon content leaves as relatively pure CO&#x2F;CO
2&#x2F;H2&#x2F;H2O gas (depending on the feed conditions, whether steam or air is used), and the effluent only requires a cold trap and a mild aqueous wash (except mercury-containing wastes). It has been used for safe biological and chemical weapons destruction, and processing waste such as scrap tires where direct incineration&#x2F;effluent treatment is difficult. The major downside of the process compared to direct incineration is the eventual saturation of the melt by contaminants, and needing reprocessing&#x2F;replacement.<p><a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Molten_salt_oxidation"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Molten_salt_oxidation</a>"

"Like other people, the startup isn&#x27;t much of a problem to me since I can easily adapt (and even prefer) a REPL based development and for the stuff I use Julia that one time cost is more than worth it, but the problem of the initial JIT lag is that it affects the first impression of the language, which probably has a significant effect in adoption and good word of mouth from people who didn&#x27;t stay enough to appreciate the compromises being done.<p>Julia language development seems to be guided towards avoiding making damaging mistakes on the long run (for example focusing early on having a stable programmable multi-stage compilation, very efficient union-types and state of the art multithreading so the library ecosystem can grow with the correct assumptions). But the &quot;time to first plot&quot; is something that can be solved (regardless of it being hard or easy) at any time &quot;with no consequences&quot;, since libraries written with the expectation of a slow startup will work just as well when that problem is solved. Though the compiler team did acknowledge the issue and are prioritizing it post 1.3.<p>I do wonder if focusing on doing the very simple things well first (like python does right now), would be a better strategy, or it would just make people ignore the language because the simple things are already covered everywhere and not interesting enough for bringing people (compared to the amazing stuff Julia can do with supercomputers&#x2F;clusters and state of the art stuff like Zygote)."

"framing failing fast or not as a conflict of interest between computer and codebase is an interesting one.

The “state of the art” still seems to be things like “have asserts turned on in the debug build” but a holistic approach where the application has different runtime contracts with regards to failures based upon who is using the app seems somewhat underutilized — I’ve done it piecemeal with application feature flags but has anything like this been done at the platform&#x2F;language&#x2F;framework level?"

Lately I’ve been experimenting with the idea of fully native cross platform desktop apps. Latest iteration is to write the majority of the app in Go and communicate with a native frontend over TCP. So far I’m finding that building a really simple UI and communicating over TCP to be pretty simple. At the same time I keep the majority of the business logic in the go server. It probably doesn’t work for all app types but it is fun to play with.<p>With Rust I imagine taking advantage of LLVM you could just import the business logic into whatever app environment you need to and work it that way. Has anyone here tried that? I would love to hear how it went.

"It&#x27;s the first time I see this kind of graphic, but that cone looks very suspiciously narrow and smooth, especially in the later days.<p>Are they really properly compounding the probabilities here? Like to create the boundary for the second day you have to sample a number of possible positions from the first day, recompute a possible path from these samples, and then expand the area out of these forwarded samples, based on uncertainty. The boundary at day 2 should be related to the samples that went the most off course.<p>It looks like they just restart from the best-guess predicted position for day 2 which is already based on a <i>prediction</i> for day 1, and multiply it with the uncertainty, with a factor to account for one passing day. If that&#x27;s the case this is <i>really</i> misleading. I imagine if they did it the way I&#x27;m thinking the cone could get very large very fast, but most importantly it wouldn&#x27;t be smooth and symmetrical like this."

"This is really applicable to any products that are valued based on their marketing efforts instead of intrinsic value or utility.

"I am just wondering, why there is no similar product as FPGA array. As far as I know, it’s the cheapest way to see if there is product&#x2F;market fit for a semiconductor product. High speed transceiver as well as memory controllers are included in FPGA. This single wafer approach looks very interesting to me. I was intern at Infineon some time ago and was working on device distribution characterization across 200 mm wafer. The chips in the middle were 2-3 better performing than these in the border. So how Cerberas’s chip manages this issue? Middle parts are throttled or low performing areas near wafer’s boarder are disabled? How much does it cost?.. I can imagine it being shipped on thermal pad with liquid nitrogen cooling bellow. There must be some wires bonded for interface to the host. Very interesting technical project. I am very curious what are the clients for such huge specialized chip."

"Just the fact that you will be profiting off of this perceived issue, means you have some interest in the root causes of impaired driving remaining unsolved.

"I love remote work too. But I strongly believe it&#x27;s not for everyone. Not even 50% of the population. It would be a mistake to assume that it&#x27;s easy for everyone.

Most people crave engagement without even realizing it.<p>It also really depends on the job and the company. If remote working means never going off, I think it&#x27;s a company culture problem rather than a problem of remote working itself. It might be true that since remote work is relatively new the boundaries and the culture might not be fully formed yet for many companies but I think everyone that works remotely should realize this and set expectations and boundaries accordingly."

"There&#x27;s several things to keep in mind that can help. I also would prefer to approach discussion as an argument as that is the most direct way to learn and clarify your own thoughts. Unfortunately due to how people are, the situations where argumentation is actually effective for that purpose are all too rare.<p>I try to approach most online discussion from a perspective of understanding rather than trying to convince, argue, or prove something. This also directly aligns with the goal of learning, because, well, that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m trying to do.<p>The first thing it helps to realise is that every individual is at a different level of understanding. Not everyone cares that much about learning &amp; understanding, so often people are just repeating things they&#x27;ve heard and internalised. It takes work and time to &quot;unstick&quot; people who are like this from their current mindset, and for anonymous conversations on the internet, that&#x27;s never going to be worth it. You&#x27;re also unlikely to learn anything by engaging in argument as they probably don&#x27;t even know the reason themselves why they believe what they do.<p>The second thing to think is - is it worth it? What will really happen if this person continues to believe as they do? Is whatever you can potentially learn from them even worth the time? Even if you do end up continuing the discussion, asking yourself these things can help you step back and communicate from a more collaborative, flexible place.<p>As other commenters have mentioned, communicating by text on the Internet is difficult to convey exactly what you meant. No matter what you write, some people are going to misinterpret you. A lot of arguments I&#x27;ve seen happen when both parties essentially talk past each other, quoting each other&#x27;s responses but never actually engaging with each other&#x27;s points. Whether because they didn&#x27;t read the initial post carefully, or they basically understand the other person&#x27;s points but think something else is more important so argue about that instead, while the original poster thinks that&#x27;s irrelevant and continues trying to convince the replier that they&#x27;re correct. Often if you came right down to it and somehow magically gave everyone a clear, semantic understanding of the content of what the other person was saying, there would be no disagreement. But these kinds of things seem to happen a lot and cause a lot of bad feelings.<p>The other thing is that actual disagreements about verifiable facts are rare between two reasonable people, once the relevant knowledge sources have been shared. If someone is unreasonable, just don&#x27;t engage with them at all.<p>Much more often, each person has a certain context of personal experience which informs their opinion. When both people express their opinions through text, it can seem (to each other) like they&#x27;re in conflict, when in reality the different opinions are each applicable to different situations and equally valid given each person&#x27;s individual experience. This can be difficult to notice, but something to be aware of.<p>In summary, a process you might go through when reading something is:<p>1. you have a knee-jerk &quot;that&#x27;s wrong&quot; reaction. You need to stop yourself from immediately saying something in response.<p>2. Carefully read (and re-read) what they actually wrote.^1 Try to interpret it charitably - based on what they did actually write, what are they actually meaning? Usually if you&#x27;re in an argumentative mindset, you interpret things more adverserially than they actually are.<p>^1: I can&#x27;t count the number of times I&#x27;ve started writing a response, then before I submit I go back to read the post I&#x27;m responding to, and see something I missed that makes a large part of my post irrelevant and unnecessarily negative.<p>3. Try to understand where they&#x27;re coming from. If something isn&#x27;t clear, before you do anything else ask non-confrontational questions, giving them the benefit of the doubt. If you&#x27;ve got to this point, probably 90% of unpleasant arguments are already avoided.<p>4. Put forward your viewpoint and have a discussion as normal.<p>5. Apply the same charitable interpretation to every response and be willing to admit when you&#x27;re wrong. If the discussion is getting heated and feelings are potentially getting involved, de-escalate as fast as possible, even if that means admitting you&#x27;re wrong when you don&#x27;t actually believe that. (Ideally you would convey respectfully that their points have merit in some way and just leave the discussion rather than straight up lying.)<p>Throughout all this, remember that people other than the person you&#x27;re discussing with are likely reading what you write, so even if you&#x27;re failing to get through to the individual, other people may find significant value in your discussion (even if they will likely never actually reply and say so.)<p>Additionally, if you&#x27;re behaving respectfully and setting a good example while the other person is getting emotional, other people with no emotional investment will tend to take your side even if they know literally nothing about the subject matter. There&#x27;s simply no downside to making the effort to consider the other person&#x27;s emotional state and mindset because it makes the experience better for everyone."

"Can&#x27;t agree more, CarPlay is IMHO the only &quot;smart&quot; functionality that actually makes sense to use with my car. Their native infotainment system feels more like &quot;everyone else has it, let&#x27;s put something together quick&quot;, than a serious software project. And especially stupid is that, because they sell multiple packages of equipment, there are overlapping functionalities. For instance I have a clock on main board and on the touch screen, and they&#x27;re not in sync as those are 2 completely separate systems.  There are also two temperatures (at least they usually match). Infotainment system has no access to car performance params, I have to use weird stick behind the wheel to, for instance, check the tire pressure, although that&#x27;s a type of info that&#x27;s much more appropriate for touch screen than the half of the features they&#x27;ve put there... literally zero thought was given on how to create integrated and pleasurable UX, it&#x27;s just a number of pluggable modules, to make it easier to sell..."

"To my mind, the blockers for Perl 6 adoption in order of importance have been:<p>1. The name, saddling it with the legacy of Perl. (I say this as someone who really liked working with Perl back in the waning years of the old millennium, and believes that Perl was visionary in pointing the way to the state of modern programming... but also that it had some limitations that have only become more glaring over the years.)<p>2. The coyness around whether it&#x27;s &quot;done&quot; or not. Right now today, as someone who has paid attention to Perl 6 and even written some toy code with it, I do not understand its release status at all. That&#x27;s absurd.<p>3. The insistence on branding sub-components of it and exposing that branding. Yes, it has a VM. Yes, it has a compiler. But why do people talk about ParrotVM and Rakudo as if they&#x27;re different things? Java has a compiler and a VM, they&#x27;re called &quot;javac&quot; and &quot;jvm.&quot; This wifty &quot;no, Perl 6 is the standard, the software you&#x27;re running is Rakudo and Parrot&quot; distinction is totally irrelevant to anyone actually wanting to write code, and weirdly confusing.<p>4.

Maya has failed me so many times, I cannot recommend it in any way other than it is still (sadly) used very commonly among studios.

"I toured Patagonia&#x27;s headquarters last year after featuring Vincent Stanley, who has been with them since 1973, on my podcast <a href=""http:&#x2F;&#x2F;joshuaspodek.com&#x2F;guests&#x2F;vincent-stanley"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;joshuaspodek.com&#x2F;guests&#x2F;vincent-stanley</a>. The culture was amazing -- friendly, productive, supportive.<p>I asked a random employee to join me for lunch. Whatever I asked about company vision, culture, etc she knew. When I asked why they did this or that thing a certain way, she&#x27;d say things like &quot;Person A saw a problem with how we were doing it before, but couldn&#x27;t solve it. Person B figured out how to solve it but couldn&#x27;t implement it. Person C implemented it.&quot;<p>Critical to all their decisions, as I heard, were the environment, employees, suppliers&#x27; employees, and customers.<p>In most places, Person A&#x27;s recognition of a problem would lead to everyone else saying, &quot;Well, what can you do?&quot; and leave it. If by some chance person B solved it despite the inertia, people would respond, &quot;But what about X or Y&quot; or some edge case and leave it.<p>Nearly any company could learn from Patagonia&#x27;s culture."

"I am in Verona (Italy) at this time, and I&#x27;m in a hotel where some tourists from Shanghai happen to be as well.
I&#x27;m alone, so I hang out in the lobby a lot. I just engaged in some small talk with some of those tourists, and the discussion somehow shifted to the Hong Kong protests.<p>Basically what they sad is that western culture in Hong Kong clashes with the chinese culture. They don&#x27;t seem to say that the chinese way is the right way, or that the western culture is the one to accept. They just say that they are different, and that of course a shift in culture is difficult for Hong Kongers. They think it will all pan out somehow: Hong Kong has to accept that they are Chinese now, and accept all the consequences that come with that.<p>I understand that the viewpoint of hn, a very USA oriented site, is different, and that most people here think that the libery of HK people should not be taken away from them because democracy is the only way, but I think the chinese point of view should be heard as well, and should be taken into consideration to get a better understanding of everything that is happening.<p>My personal opinion on this is that China should just let them keep their autonomy, and let them be Hong Kong: a state by it&#x27;s own with it&#x27;s own rules and laws."
"An idea related to this helped me get a grasp on writing proofs when I was first struggling to teach myself mathematics.<p>The idea was roughly:<p>A particular formalized proof (or lemma) is one of many ways of expressing&#x2F;representing a more general concept that grounds some mathematical idea. It seems to mirror the way you could have the general concept of &quot;having gone to the store and purchased bananas&quot; in your head but express it many different ways through natural language.<p>If humans were doing mathematics by thinking purely in terms of the theorem space of some particular formal system, then &#x27;collapses&#x27; should be expected after minor errors: if you take one wrong turn, your error should be compounded in any further progress.<p>But that does not appear to be how we do mathematics. Instead we&#x27;re operating in a more general space of concepts, and we do <i>not</i> do math by proceeding linearly in our thoughts from the beginning of a proof to the final conclusion--we assemble the conception piecemeal until we get some feel for the sufficient overall integrity&#x2F;coherence of a general conception, and then secure it by building up a kind of formal carapace around it. But if part of the proof&#x2F;carapace is wrong, it&#x27;s like a malformed section of armor that needs to be replaced: the whole structure isn&#x27;t going to collapse because of it (not that that <i>couldn&#x27;t</i> happen).<p>Thinking about things that way gave me a better view (I think) on how to use and think about formalizations when doing mathematics."

Get books&#x2F;materials that have solutions (not just problems).
use those, compare your results, and then try again.<p>If you feel like you do not understand &#x27;why&#x27;, you will need a particular subject area. Switch to read about applications of that area, how historically it came about and so.<p>And then back to problem solving, proofs, and reading other people&#x27;s papers (when you can..).<p>It is hard work,  but over time you will build up your version of the so called intuition, it will be powerful, you will be able to apply it all over the place.<p>Also there are a number of math forums where you can reach out, if you are really stuck and cannot figure out how a particular proof, or solution was obtained."

Alexander, after a meeting with his officer, Coenus, and after hearing about the lament of his soldiers,[6] eventually relented,[7] being convinced that it was better to return. This caused Alexander to turn south, advancing through southern Punjab and Sindh, along the way conquering more tribes along the lower Indus River, before finally turning westward.[8]<p>Alexander died in Babylon on 10 or 11 June 323 BC.

"The author gets this topic utterly backward.  Large insurance companies each have essentially no business incentive to do anything except pay claims.  Maybe they try to get insureds back to baseline on the cheap, but deny an insured loss entirely?  No.  Not even investigate them.<p>And so fraudulent claims and the shadow industry that surrounds them grow in size until something bad happens, like a grandma dies in a commercially-staged motor vehicle accident.[1]  And then everyone gets all introspective and tries to figure out how we got to that regrettable point and what we can do to walk things back to a sane place where fraudulent activity is not acceptable.<p>Unfortunately, the basic incentives in the insurance industry still are, and always will remain, for companies to do as <i>little</i> as possible about fraudulent claims.  What I see in the facts reported by the article are companies that have used fraud investigators who are poorly trained or under-resourced and are generating erroneous or weakly-supported evidence of fraud, which the companies then hand off to public authorities who apparently have no better resources.  That leads to two observations:<p>1.  If the problem is irrational, counterproductive prosecutions due to poor training and resources, writing a hit-piece about supposed conflicts of interests over supplemental <i>funding</i> being used to patch the resource problems isn&#x27;t really part of the solution.<p>2.  The insurance companies are paying for the consequences of poor-quality investigations communicated to authorities by their investigators.  The article talks about some of the claimants suing the insurers for bad faith practices (and defamation?), which I&#x27;d call a &quot;cottage&quot; industry in the U.S., except that the industry is quite large and active.  The insurers named in the article most definitely have been incentivized to learn the lesson not to refer marginal fraud prosecutions-- maybe not to refer prosecutions at all-- and so we&#x27;ll repeat the cycle mentioned above until at a future time a grandmother, aunt or child is killed again in a staged fraudulent insurance claim, and then everyone will get introspective again and muse that at one point we had laws that incentivized insurers to identify and prosecute scam artists but bad press like this article led to changes that made them stop.<p>[1]  <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ifb.org&#x2F;(X(1)S(dzqyttjltzr0pry1l1wmvlxj))&#x2F;ContentPages&#x2F;CIFI&#x2F;DefaultCIFI.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ifb.org&#x2F;(X(1)S(dzqyttjltzr0pry1l1wmvlxj))&#x2F;Conten...</a>"

Imagine if instead of NPM maintaing all of its servers, it was just a thin database that had better routing to github releases? Would that fall afoul with GitHub?<p>I mean, whats the point of maintaining your own distribution server when GitHub can front all the hosting costs and all you have to do is map the name of a package to its Github Package Release URL. I could see NPM, PyPI et. al. just doing that, instead of having their own servers.

"Since others have answered with specific tech stacks, I&#x27;ll give a more generalized&#x2F;abstracted answer. While getting started, here are a few high-level principles I found useful to adhere that will make your life easier later:<p>Think of a multi-stage pipeline for getting raw data from your transactional&#x2F;interaction systems and extracting insights and intelligence out of them.<p>Stage-1: Ingestion – Keep this simple. Don&#x27;t mess this up. Its a serious headache if you do.<p>1. Generate a request-id or message-id at the genesis of the request and propagate it throughout your call graph from client to servers (across any number of api call graph hops).<p>2. At each node in the call graph, emit whatever logs you want to emit, include this id.<p>3. Use whatever format you find natural and easy to use in each tech stack environment. Key is to make the logging instrumentation very natural and normal to each codebase such that the instrumentation does not get accidentally broken while adding new features.<p>4. Build a plumbing layer (agnostic of what is being logged) that can locally buffer these log messages, periodically compress and package them with added sequence and integrity verification mechanisms, and reliability transmit them to a central warehouse. Use this across all your server-side nodes. Build a similar one for each of your client side platforms.<p>5. At the central warehouse, immediately persist these log packages durably and then only respond to client indicating it is safe to purge those packages on their local nodes.<p>Stage-2: Use-case driven ETLs.<p>6. Come up with use-cases to consume this data. Define data tables (facts and dimensions) needed to support these consumption use case.<p>7. Build a high-performance stream processing system that can process the raw log packages for doing ETL (extract, transform and load) on the raw data in different formats to the defined consumable data tables.<p>Stage-3: Actual Use-case data applications.<p>Run your analytics and machine learning systems on top of these stable consumable data formats.<p>Keep the stages separate and decoupled in code and systems. Don&#x27;t do end-to-end optimizations and break the boundaries. Recognize that the actors&#x2F;stakeholders involved in each stage are different. The job of data team is to be the guardian of these stages and run the systems and org processes to support it."

"I&#x27;m the developer of a relatively popular app (50M+ on the Play Store) and have had very disappointing experiences with the Play Store, but in a rather opposite way from the OP:<p>Once an app reaches a certain level of popularity, you begin to see &quot;knock-off&quot; apps, which are apps with a curiously similar name and icon (and screenshots and description), but which in fact don&#x27;t do anything except blast the user with full-screen ads at every turn. It&#x27;s literally just ads; they don&#x27;t perform any actual function; they just exploit the SEO boost to serve ads to unsuspecting users.<p>I have tried &quot;reporting&quot; these apps numerous times (there are dozens of them), but Google has done nothing at all to remove these apps or suspend the accounts of these bottom-feeding &quot;developers&quot;.  The only conclusion is that the ad revenue benefits Google as well as the bottom-feeders, so Google drags its feet in taking any action.  I would bet that if these apps were doing something malicious <i>without</i> a financial incentive for Google, then Google would take them down in a heartbeat."
"The preprocessor trick of passing function macros as parameters is not that obscure. I have seen it used and I&#x27;ve used it myself. It is very useful when you have a list of static &quot;things&quot; that you need to operate on.<p>Say I have a static list of names and I would like to declare some struct type for each name. I also would like to create variables of these structs at some point, and I would always do so for the entire block of names. You could do something like this:<p><pre><code>    #define apply(fn) \
        fn(name1) \
        fn(name2) \
        fn(name3) \
        ...
        fn(nameN)

    #define make_struct(name) struct name##_t { ... }
    #define make_variable_of(name) name##_t name;
    
    ...

    apply(make_struct);  &#x2F;&#x2F; This defines all the structs.
 
    void some_function(...) {
        apply(make_variable_of);  &#x2F;&#x2F; And this defines one variable of each type.
    }
</code></pre>
Yes, it is not pretty (it is the C preprocessor after all), but it can be very useful and clean."
"Coolest finding in the paper:<p>&quot;Our analyses reveal a mutational signature, signature A, that occurred in the past but ceased to be active from about 1000 years ago. A recent study (37) detected evidence for an excess of C&gt;T mutations at TCC contexts, the mutation type most prevalent in signature A, accumulating in the human germ line between 15,000 and 2000 years ago. If this human mutation pulse is due to signature A, it could indicate a shared environmental exposure that was once widespread but has now disappeared.&quot;<p>There will now be a small academic race to identify this mysterious carcinogen which both humans and this dog cancer were previously exposed to."
"Considering the success of neural network image classifiers, it seems garbage sorting would be a slam dunk application for these reasons:<p>(1) the training data is readily available.  there are human sorters who already are classifying everything in real-time as they pick stuff off the conveyor and move the item to the right bin. train cameras on the conveyor belt and the analyze which items are picked out and which bin they get tossed in.<p>(2) the NN doesn&#x27;t have to be anywhere near as accurate as, say, a self-driving car. tune the classifier to minimize false positives. If the resulting NN can classify only 70% of the items, but accurately, that means 70% of the garbage stream can be automated and run 24&#x2F;7.  Humans can still go through the remaining 30% if it economically makes sense."

Simple: the laws of most physics say you can look at something now and work it backwards.

But more commonly — I understand their role more in construction to me more in the realm of being a maintainer of documentation — maybe they have some role in proposing the original design but the majority of their time is probably spent ensuring that these plans satisfy all required regulations — and updating the plans in response to what actually happens during building so that the building itself will pass all regulations ...<p>This is nothing at all like the nebulous responsibilities generally associated with software architects.  Some projects could benefit from this level of book keeping requirement — but a lot of projects which contain “software architects” probably would reject paying someone to maintain specifications to a similar level of accuracy as is required of real world architects — especially if that was basically all that was being asked of them to do ..."

"Let&#x27;s use it to flip around an orbital telescope and beam everyone. We have a little delay between what we can predict with NASA Sun and Space, and we know where it&#x27;s going with our accurate models of the cosmos.

All you have is a model of human cell division, a layer of acceptable risk tolerance. Open it up and add some more interface and control into what humans can do.

"We at VictoriaMetrics recognized importance of splitting up storage and query nodes as well. We went even further -- separated insert nodes from storage nodes. So for cluster version we have 3 types of nodes:<p><pre><code>  * vminsert (stateless)

  * vmstorage (stateful)

However, we found out that PostgreSQL storage layer takes incredibly huge amount of space -- 28 bytes&#x2F;metrics versus 0.4 b&#x2F;m with VictoriaMetrics (70x difference!) for typical real-world data.

"Does anyone but me have the suspicion that the animosity towards solar roads was something to do with a &#x27;nerve being touched&#x27;, some kind of &#x27;triggering&#x27;? Sure, they might not work out, but lots of stupid-sounding ideas (&#x27;a horseless carriage? Whatever next?&#x27;) have turned out to work, just as much as lots of somewhat futuristic but nonetheless sensible sounding ideas have turned out not to be here yet (&#x27;flying cars are just around the corner&#x27;). Who knows, at some point in the future, with different technologies and materials, different efficiencies and performance, we might indeed find solar energy being collected from roads. Just as we are laughing right now at the current, ludicrously oversold and patently unsuccessful efforts, future generations may be laughing at our arrogant dismissal of an idea that might ultimately have just turned out to have been ahead of its time. Let&#x27;s applaud the audacity of the solar roadways hubris in the spirit of uninhibited innovative endeavour, just as much as we pat ourselves on the back for having successfully spotted its obvious shortcomings and predicted its seemingly inevitable struggle for survival."

"Let&#x27;s reduce economics to its barest rudiments: I&#x27;m pretty sure a worker could buy a house and support a family in 1950 on a single, average 40 hour a week salary; this was probably also true even as late as 1970. How many workers in the modern economy can buy a house and support a family on 1&#x2F;4 of a 40 hour a week salary?<p>Those &quot;productivity&quot; numbers are obviously cooking the books bullshit. Either that or they&#x27;re not measuring the right things. If the bare rudiments; food, housing, family creation cost the same or more, but we claim productivity has increased because ...

Sometimes technically better architecture and user interface lose to a non user friendly hard solutions due to inertia of mass adoption.<p>So a lesson in Software development is similar to betamax and VHS, so marketing is still a winner over technically superior architecture and ease of use.

The size of the start of the cone is the same as the size of the hurricane
2. There is a well defined border to the path
3. There is no additional shading outside the cone that indicates &quot;could also face danger&quot;<p>Furthermore, &quot;probable path of the storm center&quot; is not something the general public cares about!

This is different than saying &quot;the storm may extend beyond the edges of the cone&quot;. And the next line is &quot;hazardous conditions may occur outside the cone.&quot; Okay, every time there&#x27;s a thunderstorm or 50mph wind gusts, there&#x27;s an alert in my weather app about hazardous conditions. That information is too vague to be actionable. This doesn&#x27;t even touch on the design aspects of this graphic, such as how the massive amount of text, size, color, spacing, etc, seems to draw the eye away from that message at the top.<p>But getting back to a point from a previous paragraph, why is this even disseminated widely at all, when this graphic is so misleading and also not what people need to know? Is it the NHS pushing it out to the public? Is it the media? It seems wildly irresponsible. The tropical storm force wind speeds graphic mentioned in TFA would be a much better product to deliver. Or, just create a graphic that is what the article has already identified as the natural interpretation - a cone of the possible area that could be affected by the hurricane!<p>Sorry, but excuses for poor design are a real pet peeve of mine."

"We don&#x27;t have IT scams like this in Lithuania,as nobody ever pays for IT support,they just get someone they know to do it for free. However massive prize scams used to be quite popular and still are to certain degree today. Scammer calls a victim and claims he&#x27;s calling from a radio show,some company, events organiser, whatever.Then obviously comes the part where he saya that the victim won x,y,z and all they. need to do is to buy some prepaid topup cards for mobile( these usually have a code on them that needs to be used to add credit) and tell the con artist those codes,for &quot;verification purposes&quot; or whatever the reason of the day is. This was many years ago. One day,a friend of mine gets home and his dad,a surgeon, shouts across the room: Anthony,we won!!!!we won it all!!My friend: what? Yeah,we won!! HI-Fi system, a vacuum cleaner and I think a washing masine as well!!!Yeah! My friend,still being quite confused about his dad&#x27;s instant gains: what are you talking about, where&#x27;s this coming from? Well,the guy called from the radio,they ran a game and we won.Anthony, here&#x27;s some money(it was at least a couple weeks wage),go to the shop across the road and buy topup cards,will you?

"This sounds like a clear case of consultant software. <i>The people building it won&#x27;t be dogfooding the result</i> - at most they&#x27;ll be clicking around the UI on their powerful desktop machine and patting themselves on the back because it responds in less than half a second. <i>The requirements will be vague,</i> because getting performance requirements anywhere beyond stupidly vague &quot;performant on modern hardware&quot; or some shit requires <i>real expertise</i> in UI design and will cost <i>real money</i> to build, and UI designers won&#x27;t be involved in the details until the contract is signed.<p>&quot;Premature optimization&quot; in reality is a vacuous phrase, because premature <i>anything</i> is bad - it&#x27;s right there in the word!

"The problem with the rainbow color map is having green in the middle; green is the highest contrast color and stands out from red and blue and so gives the impression of being “brighter”, undermining the red-green-blue ordering.<p>Personally I <i>much</i> prefer colormaps that contain any two primaries out of the three red&#x2F;green&#x2F;blue, but not all three. Chroma can be included (so mixing white and black). All the non-rainbow colormap pictures in the article can be described this way, and to my eyes the perceptual value is superior than all the rainbow-map images.<p>I found it a little strange that the blog post made a deal of calling out Jet for not being perceptually linear, and then announced that Turbo is not perceptually linear, just a bit smoother."

"Something that never seems to come up when one of Jeff&#x27;s art defense posts come up is that an RPG has a considerably higher asset load than most types of games, not just graphically but all around.<p>And historically, the genre has responded to this by sacrificing some aspect of polish - typically animation, but also often by just telling you about a thing with text.<p>What Jeff has done by stocking up and reusing generic assets is essentially a way of reducing that load so that the game actually gets produced on his microbudget targets. And what&#x27;s really lost in that is any sort of &quot;wow&quot; moment where a distinctive scene, magic item or character design can make an impression visually.<p>However, I do think he could stand to leverage technology better. 3D might not be nostalgic, but it is the overwhelming preference of devs trying to use  generic assets, since it gives you so much more utility(take the sword model and reskin it - new sword! same building with different decor - new scene!) and even puts some stock animation within reach, when relying on Mixamo or similar.<p>Jeff is already using these kinds of stock assets in the new game, it&#x27;s just that  faithfully implementing them into an old-style 2D tile renderer system makes them look <i>worse</i> than they actually are, since it guarantees that they look inconsistent in scale, perspective, lighting etc.<p>One productive way to respond to his challenge would be to give him an A&#x2F;B: license his existing work to a small self-funded team, have them remake it aesthetically without changing how it plays. Have it launch on consoles and mobile. Then we&#x27;d really know if the assertions match the reality."

"Tried this on our project, GitHub.com&#x2F;hail-is&#x2F;hail.<p>Sphinx is a persistent thorn in our side, but we&#x27;ve made it work.

Quite slow, maybe a couple minutes. Looks like one core is at 100% during this process. We&#x27;ve got ~400 files. Maybe its parsing some data files? The whole directory is 318 MB.<p>---<p>Now I&#x27;m looking at the docs.<p>First thing I notice is that Python type hint forward references break everything. Consider:<p><pre><code>    class GroupedMatrixTable(
        parent: &#x27;MatrixTable&#x27;,

"It took China almost 30 years to cultivate economic development zones into the logistics chain to build the first iPhone. That kind of development can&#x27;t be replicated in a few years, is likely out of reach for smaller nations (read anyone except India) or viable in a geographically distributed fashion. The problem isn&#x27;t just moving factories but have a geographically centralized logistics chain where thousands of components are within hours of each other, supported by millions of specialized high skill labor, preferably with similar language proficiency, where new production can be rapidly iterated to meet market demands. A &quot;small&quot; country with 100 million people are not going train a large proportion off their entire population to fill football fields with tooling engineers and other specialists. It&#x27;s just not demographically in their cards. And it&#x27;s that level of centralized scale that enables China to manufacture high end electronics in the timescales that modern business cycles require.<p>That&#x27;s why all the outsourced electronics production so far are low end assembly in countries adjacent to China where components made in China (other than very high end IC) can be quickly shipped to them have locals can be trained to assemble processes that has been matured and figured out in China. If all Chinese manufacturing magically shifted across ASEAN countries, I don&#x27;t think there would be the collective capability to organize logistically to produce and iterate a new annual Apple product launch - the entire Tim Cook screw anecdote. The nature of manufacturing has changed. Maybe India can replicate that, they are not starting from zero, but I don&#x27;t know if Indian democracy can make the extremely unpopular changes Chinese state directed capitalism &#x2F; SEZ went through. This isn&#x27;t an issue that can be solved by funneling money &#x2F; FDI, these things take much longer time than a few years and still can&#x27;t replicate the advantages of Chinese scale on things where scale matters. There&#x27;s a qualitative difference in different governance models ability to execute policy and realize capabilities. Distributing Chinese manufacturing among bunch of competing countries with inevitably expensive and inefficient physical and regulatory interconnects just won&#x27;t produce the same capabilities.<p>Even if we ignore the fact that countries like Vietnam are reaching infrastructure and labour limits, i.e. they literally at land, road, port, worker capacity which will optimistically take decades to cultivate - generations in terms of expertise that can&#x27;t be rushed. Or that a lot of the factories that moved out of China are Chinese owned so money and control is still tied to CPC. Or China might undercut ASEAN by setting up parallel manufacturing in Chinese influenced Africa. There&#x27;s still the matter of automation. Shorterm, China is targeting to increase automation from 68 industrial robots per 10,000 employees (14th in the world) to 150&#x2F;10,000 employees (9th).

China is not stopping at 150 long term, their poor demographics lack of youth due to family planning means labour heavy manufacturing is on the way out, but automation will potentially enable China to retain all their manufacturing advantages in terms of logistics and expertise in long run. And once China learns to make advanced integrated circuits and airplane engines, maybe software, they&#x27;ll more or less have no western dependencies."
"Thank you, this is fantastic. I am working with a 100+ employee company doing highly technical engineering work in a very rural location, currently trying to run their business off of 10 MBPS. They are getting quotes exceeding $500k from most people they talk to just get any additional bandwidth to them (presumable fixed line fiber), which has resulted in this critical upgrade being put off for quite some time. This guide makes me think they could quite possibly build out their own backhaul system to a neighboring town for substantially less money. Should make my next conversation very interesting."
"A lot of intuition in math is from geometry.  High school plane geometry is a good start, but high school solid geometry, where get good tools and intuition for seeing things in 3D instead of just the 2D of plane geometry, is quite a bit better.<p>Another part of intuition is from Max Zorn (from Zorn&#x27;s lemma statement of the axiom of choice):<p>&quot;Be wise, generalize.&quot;<p>E.g., for the set of real numbers R and a positive integer n, a lot that goes on in the n-dimensional vector space R^n is a <i>generalization</i> of what can see in 3D, e.g., from solid geometry.<p>E.g., in both cases, a biggie is a perpendicular (<i>orthogonal</i>) projection and, again, the Pythagorean theorem.  E.g., regression in statistics is a perpendicular projection.<p>Perpendicular (orthogonality) is a biggie and is a major part of, say, Fourier series.  I.e., each of the sine&#x2F;cosine waves used is an orthogonal axis, and to find the corresponding Fourier series coefficient just project onto that axis.  The projection is an integral of a product, and that is commonly an <i>inner product</i> which close to just a cosine of an angle as in plane and solid geometry and a perpendicular projection and close to correlation in statistics, etc.<p>E.g., a huge fraction of applied math is from <i>analysis</i> in pure math, and from G. F. Simmons the two pillars of analysis are &quot;continuity and linearity&quot;.  Linearity generalizes enormously:  The quantum mechanics <i>super position</i> is essentially linearity.  Under meager assumptions, differentiation and integration in calculus are linear <i>operators</i>.  In probability theory, expectation is a linear operator.  The wave equation is a linear partial differential equation.  Linear programming works on linear equations.    Of course, in <i>linear</i> algebra, matrix multiplication is a linear operator. When something is not linear, it may be <i>locally</i> linear which can be enough to get useful results.<p>For more, a good lesson is to <i>approximate</i>:  Commonly we can&#x27;t get just what we want in just one step but can <i>iterate</i> and <i>approximate</i> as closely as we please.  So, can use simple things, sine waves, polynomials, continuous functions, and more, as means of approximation.  Such approximation gets us close to more in <i>continuity</i> and, in particular, <i>completeness</i> -- the real numbers are <i>complete</i> and the rational numbers are not but via iteration can approximate the reals as closely as we please.  Then this generalizes:  The big point about Hilbert space (as mathematicians but not always physicists define it) is completeness.  A joke, partly correct, is that &quot;calculus is the elementary consequences of the completeness property of the real number system&quot;.  E.g., the integral in calculus (and its better version in measure theory) is defined in terms of an iterative approximation.  So, if you are good with sine waves, polynomials, continuous functions, wavelets, and more, then you can iterate and approximate a lot, in many cases, everything there is in that case."

"I just don&#x27;t feel like rust can replace C&#x2F;C++, because the syntax is not simple enough.

"I know a lot of people here have fond memories of Encarta, but I found it to be a disappointment. When my family first got a copy of it with a new computer I was probably about 16 at the time (around 1994 I think) and I was excited to explore it.<p>I found that it had only very basic information and didn&#x27;t go into any detail. I was very disappointed because I was expecting so much more information about the topics I looked at and the multimedia elements just seemed to be there to show off the technology rather than actually be useful. I put it away and never looked at Encarta again. I know wonder if there was useful information that I never found because I didn&#x27;t spend enough time looking at it.<p>I also found many paper encyclopedias to be disappointing as well, and were only useful for giving me a short summary when I knew absolutely nothing about a topic. I really enjoyed the special Encyclopedia Britannica volumes with more in-depth articles on a smaller number of topics. Those were much better than the regular volumes with minimal information.<p>I think I wanted to learn so much more about the topics I was interested in, and information was hard for me to find in those days. Only my local public library had books the sufficient depth of knowledge to make me happy.<p>If I had known about the amazing skills of professional librarians back then, I would have had a librarian help me find information. At the time, I just thought that they were there to shelve books and check them out to people and had little other skills."

I would be really interested if someone did a study.  It seems Dogs in the house raise the risk significantly.  Dogs on a walk behave in the most risky way possible hanging out in tall grass and going everywhere (they&#x27;re dogs, can&#x27;t blame them) and they have a nice furry coat that is easy to grab onto for the ticks.  Then you need to check the dog and remove the ticks, bringing yourself into contact with the ticks.   Or you miss them and now the ticks are crawling around in your house.<p>Dog owners also seem to wear more casual clothes going for a walk with the dog.  The dog drags them into areas they might not have gone on their own.  The casual clothes provide more surface to grab onto vs dedicated clothes an outdoor enthusiast is wearing.

While the infrastructure is indeed somewhat better than the BA, I was shocked by the widespread hate for cyclists everywhere in Seattle and surrounding areas. Getting honked at is a regular occurrence here, and people will actually stick their head out of their cars to make sure you hear the insults they are shouting at you, while simultaneously giving you the finger. It gets worse: a couple weeks ago somebody hiding behind some trees threw a rock at me while riding on the Burke Gilman trail. Fortunately they missed me.

"One of the lessons learned in the modern era is that you just can&#x27;t get away with this kind of stuff - everything comes back to bite you in the end.<p>I don&#x27;t know which government officials in the communist party thinks this kind of investment will be successful - and it may be short term successful - but you end up paying for it in the long run.<p>Maybe said gov&#x27;t official ran a business selling chinese goods on Amazon and used fake reviews to successfully grow the business by pawning off really poorly made products into consumer hands. He&#x2F;she witnessed the success and applied that theory everywhere - you can always buy your way to a good impression.<p>Well, it works (kinda) on Amazon because the blame and outrage still gets created, its just that there&#x27;s no entity to ascribe the blame onto. The store is usually brandless, or can rebrand itself in an instant if things go south.<p>BUT the blame just doesn&#x27;t dissipate into thin air. No, it gets assigned to the first thing that does have a permanent brand - Chinese goods. And then, chinese culture.<p>The US tried to use covert tactics in the 70s - 90s during the cold war era, in many places including the middle east. It was a time of naivety where &quot;I can get away with doing illegal and immoral stuff&quot; was an infectious attitude. Fast forward 30 years, and the winners are the people who immediately benefitted from those actions, but the losers (the AMERICAN GOV&#x27;T AND PUBLIC) are still paying the price via terrorism in the form of extra defense costs, safety concerns, tragedies and more.<p>Again - blame and resentment doesn&#x27;t disappear into thin air. It collects, like pollution, and you pay a price a long way down the road.<p>China, you&#x27;re not an anonymous store on Amazon. You&#x27;re one of the strongest brands in the world with 5000 years of history. Your brand is larger than Amazon, Twitter, Facebook, and Google combined. This is just not worth it."
"This seems like a good step in the right direction. I think what really needs to change is the legal system. There is way too much protection of corporations via liability.<p>It&#x27;s so easy for corporations to completely screw over the public, make a lot of money, then go out of business when they public wises up to it.<p>There are tons of examples throughout America of this. Mining companies are probably the worst.<p>The legal system needs to catch up this."

&quot;Not actual gameplay&quot; So this flashy expensive trailer is utterly pointless.<p>This is a game sequel that I am worried about. The original is a fantastic game.

"I accidentally discovered a way to battle this.  I had a phone number from a different state, far away from the state I&#x27;m living right now.

Robo caller has 1&#x2F;50 chance of hitting the right state, even lower for hitting the right region.<p>I let all strange and not-in-my-contact numbers go to voice mail which I left in default.  If it&#x27;s important enough, hit my voice mail, I will call back.  I got vastly reduced number of robocalls in the past year or so this way."
"It&#x27;s interesting how food is always the most in demand and lowest supply commodity in socialist countries (or more accurately lowest variety selection since they can barely produce enough staple foods, so they shut down the production of nice things limiting the local cultures ability to express themselves and enjoy food). You see it happening repeatedly even today in Venezuela, Cuba, and North Korea, and historically in China and Russia.<p>You&#x27;d think farming would be something they could do right since they are obsessed with those types of workers, who are their bread-and-butter. But I guess it has more to do with the price controls (probably the worst way to make something &#x27;cheaper&#x27;) and inefficiencies in the centralized organizations who think they can plan this stuff.<p>The typical excuse used by socialists re: Soviet Russia was they were exporting food for guns (because evil America), but that doesn&#x27;t equally to all of the socialists examples in history and is far more likely a direct result of their economic system."
"&gt;I used to love that car.

"A third static analyzer for Python! I wonder what this landscape is going to look like in a few years... (There are probably others, but this is the first I&#x27;d heard of Pyre, and I&#x27;d only known about mypy and pytype up until today - if there are others I&#x27;d love to hear about them!)<p>On a more substantive note, static analysis is one of those things that sounds like you shouldn&#x27;t even need it but in reality is a surprisingly powerful tool, for the same reason that all code has bugs: humans honestly suck at writing code. (For those of you that have seen Bret Victor&#x27;s &quot;Inventing on Principle&quot;, I feel like static analysis is one of the first steps in getting to the kind of feedback loop he envisions.)<p>We have all these ideas around how things <i>should</i> work, but so frequently our mental model diverges slightly from what&#x27;s actually happening (which dynamic typing only makes worse, and NPEs even more so) and that&#x27;s on <i>top</i> of the mistakes we make (like this one in the JDK, which was caught using ErrorProne, a static analyzer for Java: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bugs.openjdk.java.net&#x2F;browse&#x2F;JDK-8176402"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bugs.openjdk.java.net&#x2F;browse&#x2F;JDK-8176402</a>).<p>Also, a fun tidbit about using static analysis to apply automated code fixes: this is basically when you realize you <i>need</i> auto-formatters, because you still want your code to be indented like a sane person would after applying a change like this. (And imagine how much more complex the autoformatter&#x2F;autofixer have to be when you think about how they have to do things like preserve comments, etc!)"

"If I were to do 3 meals a day (1500 calories is low but let&#x27;s say I snack inbetween meals) and $13 per meal on average, this will cost me $39&#x2F;day, $273&#x2F;wk, $1092&#x2F;m. Maybe that&#x27;s unfair. Maybe I use this to supplement one meal a day and cook the rest. That&#x27;s $364&#x2F;m to supplement lunch and I&#x27;d still probably have to cook some rice to go along with that. I just checked my local Indian restaurants on Postmates in San Francisco. The highest priced one was at $14.99 but ~%90 of the other options were from $8.99-$10.99 and I pay for Postmates free delivery which is 7.99&#x2F;m so pretty much negligible. The other thing is that by buying from local restaurants, I can actually make a deal with the owners if I wanted to replace all my meals for the month. Let&#x27;s say the catering discount I can get is %20, which is usually what you can get on large orders ahead of time. I&#x27;m looking at $10-$2=$8 a meal or $672&#x2F;m to supplement all of my meals.<p>Finally, I&#x27;ve seen your response to this point elsewhere which seems to be, but those restaurants won&#x27;t provide the macro nutrient breakdown or have different options for proteins. Just in the dishes provided around my house there&#x27;s chicken, lamb, tofu, cheese, beans. The only thing missing really is seitan. And if I&#x27;m ordering from the same place consistently, can&#x27;t I figure out what the macros are by asking the chef for an ingredient list? One and done.<p>I wish you all the best, and I actually love this idea but I can&#x27;t make this work in my head. To me this just seems like a new, order only, expensive Indian place opened up near me. If you could reduce prices to at least meet brick and mortar restraunts then I&#x27;d consider using your service occasionally if it tastes good."

"&gt; Firstly, China has devalued the yuan to offset the rising tariffs that the United States has been imposing. In fact, China has devalued the yuan significantly since the Trump administration first placed a 10% tariff on Chinese goods – effectively negating the tariffs. And with the new 10% tariffs that Trump has promised to imposed on a wider range of goods China has in response devalued their currency further.<p>I keep seeing claims that China is devaluing without numbers or context.<p>Here&#x27;s a 10-year chart of the USD&#x2F;CNY exchange rate:<p><a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.xe.com&#x2F;currencycharts&#x2F;?from=USD&amp;to=CNY&amp;view=10Y"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.xe.com&#x2F;currencycharts&#x2F;?from=USD&amp;to=CNY&amp;view=10Y</a><p>At the start of the current administration (Jan 2017), the rate stood at about 6.96. Today it stands at 7.04.<p>In the two years after the 2016 election (April 2018), the yuan had strengthened to 6.28.<p>According to this timeline, the first round of US tariffs hit on April 7, 2017.<p><a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reuters.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;us-usa-trade-china-timeline&#x2F;timeline-key-dates-in-the-us-china-trade-war-idUSKCN1UZ24U"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reuters.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;us-usa-trade-china-timeline&#x2F;...</a><p>From the announcement of the first round of tariffs, the yuan actually strengthened. It has only &quot;weakened&quot; in the last year, and then only back to a level that slightly exceeds that of Jan 2016.<p>Yet to hear the president and others tell it, China is on a currency devaluation bender the likes of which the world has never seen. Well, I&#x27;m not seeing it at least.<p>It seems that the 7.0 level was broadly seen as a line in the sand. But like all psychological levels, they rarely mean anything in the long term.<p>The trend is clearly for more yuan weakness based on the chart alone. Perhaps we&#x27;ll even see even massive devaluation.<p>But so far that&#x27;s just speculation. The chart tells a story of a massive bowl formation (strongest yuan point in Jan 2014) hinting at severe weakness ahead, but we&#x27;re nowhere close to that at the moment."

"This is good advice because talk is very very cheap and by actually doing something you stand out of the crowd. But doing something in a field that is new to you can be daunting and learning on your own is still very inefficient. That is why those Stanford PhDs are still worth something even if all relevant information is online - they had good mentors.<p>Here are some tricks that I find make learning process less inefficient (as applied to programming of course):<p>- Formulate specific questions. This is kind of silly but many times you will have a feeling of being vaguely stuck and will just zone out instead of making progress. Instead try to precisely and succinctly formulate the problem. You can then search the Internet, ask a question on stackoverflow (or ask a mentor :) or you can look through some good open source code and see how the problem is solved there. Formulating the question focuses you. It is important to condense the question as much as you can because this way people will have to do less work to understand it and the probability that you will get an answer goes up.<p>- Find a way to test your stuff. I don&#x27;t mean specifically unit tests, it can be &quot;testing in production&quot; with the real users (it is standard startup wisdom to get user feedback as quickly as possible) or at least solving toy problems with your code, or creating a benchmarking harness and seeing where the performance bottlenecks are. First, seeing that your stuff is actually working is incredibly motivating. Second, your taste (what the Ira Glass quote in the sibling comment talks about) is subjective and can mislead you (especially if you are a beginner) and making your code confront reality is much more objective and is going to uncover problems with your work that you weren&#x27;t aware of and maybe show that some problem that you thought very important is actually not a problem at all.<p>- Watch programming streams. This thing is getting more popular these days. Much of mentoring consists of you observing how your mentor actually does stuff - how they approach problems and what are those little tricks that help them do the work - and then copying it. Watching people programming sounds silly but it is the way to observe those tricks if you are not lucky to have easy access to someone competent."

"Really cool experiment. I&#x27;d love to see how much the performance could be improved by offloading a bunch of the filtering to the GPU, though I suspect that might be a bit tricky due to driver constraints (and in particular how bad OS X drivers can be). Typically pixel shaders are quite capable of doing filtering and convolution even if you aren&#x27;t ready for compute shaders - a mid tier GPU can handle doing filters with 29 taps or more per pixel pretty easily at 60hz.<p>Ideally that&#x27;d get the CPU and power usage way down, freeing up CPU for things like streaming."

"Ridership is up, but is traffic down?<p>It doesn&#x27;t matter how many people are using this service.  What matters is <i>which</i> people are using it.  Cities are realizing that most new transit schemes aren&#x27;t getting people out of their cars.  They are leeching people away from other forms of mass transit.  Getting someone out of a bus and into a van is not a win.<p>What is needed is an actual competitor to the private car, something that can truly replace it.  The buses in my area stop at 11pm, and the nearest passenger train is a hundred km away.  Until that changes, if want to keep my job, I need to keep driving my car.  Offering me a shuttle between my door and the bus stop means literally nothing if there is no bus to get."

"It may be counter-intuitive, but I feel that without some level of consumption, what you create will be highly derivative—drawing of things you have internalized long ago, but have forgotten whereabouts they were acquired.<p>(you can see this in philosophical&#x2F;moral discussions with people who have never questioned the source of their values)<p>Some consumption is probably necessary for creativity.  You need to bring some things outside the world into yourself, or your ideas will feel made-up and phony.<p>Also, many a artist will admit a lot of what some would call &quot;copying&quot; in the art world is common - but it&#x27;s more akin to reacting to something from a peer and then putting a unique twisted outlook on it; and this almost creates a &#x27;conversation&#x27; even if the author isn&#x27;t intending that."

"&gt;Youngsters these days<p>What a marvelous start, good luck looking trustworthy. It&#x27;s straight up the same as it was generations and generations before. I also love the emphasis on video games imposed in this article, from the very beginning.<p>I have a different opinion on this. While I can confirm that some team-based games can tilt someone, it&#x27;s unlikely that it contributes to mentioned suicide rates in any meaningful way. It&#x27;s just the same kind of &quot;youngsters these days&quot; activity as it was before. The actual reason may lie deeper in the current state of human society. Fearmongering by the crackpot young adults who still didn&#x27;t grow up themselves is but one manifestation of what&#x27;s happening in the bigger picture.<p>I&#x27;m ashamed to admit, being the part of this &quot;young adult&quot; generation myself, that we&#x27;re a laughable bunch of irresponsible wimps, relying on everything but ourselves to relieve the stress posed onto us by the ordinary &quot;adult&quot; problems. As the result, some of us easily fall the cult-like mobs, failing to recognize the stupidity of our derived positions and causing problems to people around us while hypocritically stating that we just want to make the world better. Our generation isn&#x27;t strong enough. We ruin each other and the majority of us is too immature to take care of our &quot;youngsters&quot;, which is the real reason behind them going rabid or just straight out killing themselves.<p>We are the ruined generation and we ruin our societies, and what&#x27;s more important, our kids, the ones who are supposed to be the next building blocks for it. And it&#x27;s most probably our fault. Or wait, do the games cause that?

I have this VIM mode that will put the font color the same as the background color, which means that you cannot see what you type. This will force you to type the same way as you speak, because it is impossible to correct words, to go back, delete. So you have to type the way you speak. Which is in a way just like talking, but without having the need to talk with someone else. At the same time it allows you to write everything in a public place, where other people can see your screen. They will probably think that you are crazy, or that they got some problem with their vision, because they cannot see anything. But you do not care and continue typing. And after some time you realize that typing blindly as well helps you to formulate your sentence before you type it.<p>Well, now the 5 minutes are over, it was a nice experience, but I like my VIM s0u7-mode better"

So I used 3G (4G was there but just not working at all) because the house Wifi was useless, in fact in the whole area this was a problem. So I started getting interested in using public Wifi (Freifunk) with a big antenna as upstream, and also provide it for the house eventually. But since then I realized that even on a normal Linux computer, configuring&#x2F;routing multiple Wifi interfaces is absolutely non-trivial.<p>Eventually I gave up, but I bet Mesh Wifi are seriously becoming a thing in dense cities.

What are cells if not computational nodes that exchange messages?<p>A much more reasonable hypothesis for what is missing is contained in the text:<p>&quot;A human cell is a remarkable piece of networked machinery that has about the same number of components as a modern jumbo jet[...]&quot;<p>Maybe we just haven&#x27;t reached the level of complexity needed for human-level AI. A hint that this might be the case is that the current excitement with ML seems to be fueled by algorithms that were mostly known by the 80s (sure, with lots of recent incremental improvements, but no new big idea). What made a difference was the computational power and datasets that became available in the 2010s. I suspect the next leap will be of a similar nature. &quot;More is different&quot;."

"&gt; In high school I did the lowest tier maths and then jumped in the deep end by doing a year of electrical engineering. I’ve now done those harder math classes but I feel like there’s holes here and there. I think when I took physics it really brought out these flaws and lack of intuition.<p>As a mathematician, I say: what you lack is not math intuition, but math knowledge. Read really hard math textbooks and solve exercises. This is the only way known to me to get better at math."
"I bought a 90&#x27;s car a few months ago - low mileage dependable Japanese car, nearly bare bones except for air conditioning and airbags (which were both optional equipment).  In average condition, they go about $2k, mine was immaculate, so it was $6k.  Truly like driving a brand new car from the mid 90&#x27;s.<p>If you are sick of the electronics, just get a &quot;new&quot; old car.  You won&#x27;t regret it.  You can even easily replace the tape deck with a high quality head unit to get all the features you need, but done right because car audio companies are just better at doing infotainment type stuff, and you can get something unobtrusive.<p>Everything that I thought I would miss, or have a hard time adjusting to be without, ABS, power windows, power locks, traction control, remote start, etc., turns out, I didn&#x27;t really need it.  Yes, there is the safety aspect of it, but I guess that depends on what kind of a drive you are, and what type of area that you live in."
"The period of time before the infiniteness of the internet but after CD-ROMs could pack lots of information was fascinating to grow up in. You had lots of curiosity but still limited access to information so you deeply explored stuff.<p>Add to that, something like Encarta was curated by opinionated editors (whether or not you agree with them is different from the fact that the nature of content is different when it isn&#x27;t trying to find consensus amongst absolutely everyone) and did not survive based on advertising as most internet content does today.<p>That set of factors made for a very different world of reading than today."

"Disclaimer: I am not a doctor.<p>If you live in a lyme-tick area, you should have antibiotics on hand at all times.<p>If you find a tick that&#x27;s already been on you long enough to cause a red irritation spot, the clock is ticking.<p>Any time spent on finding a doctor to see, waiting for test results, seeing if symptoms develop, etc. is wasted time.<p>The sooner you make your body an unfriendly environment to the bacteria, the less time they have to grow and spread.<p>This means not only antibiotics, but also not eating anything calorie dense, eating fresh garlic and other natural antibacterials, and getting a lot of sleep, when your immune system works best. If you are a weed smoker and it makes you crave food, it may help to take a tolerance break. Coffee will not help you in this situation.<p>This is a protocol I&#x27;ve learned about from several people for whom antibiotics do not work. I think there&#x27;s a book about it.<p>Doctors have told me that a 3-day course is enough to prevent a system-wide infection if you catch it early. Once an infection settles in, a longer course is needed, typically 14 days, which will do major damage to your biome."
"I have to wonder how much work is going to be required to bring qmail up to a modern standard. There&#x27;s no doubt that the author is an extremely intelligent programmer with a deep focus on security. In the intervening period Postfix has really gained in popularity, and is shipped pre-configured out of the box on some major Linux distributions. 
It is the default MTA for Fedora&#x2F;Redhat etc for some years now.<p>I wanted to like qmail, it was definitely an improvement over the complicated disaster that is Sendmail, however, it always seemed to require patches to get it to do things that Postfix could already do out of the box. In addition I didn&#x27;t like the dependency on the inetd replacement thing (daemontools?). It just felt so un-ergonomic.<p>In addition, the Maildir mailbox format (while very cool in its own right) usually required third-party software to be patched manually, for example WU-IMAP.<p>A day or two before the September 11 attacks, the UNIX time_t value rolled over to 1 billion, and went from 9 digits long to 10 digits long. The moment this happened, a comparison function in the WU-IMAP maildir patches failed, and our IMAP server started sorting and displaying all our emails out of order.<p>After scratching our heads and poring over the source code for a couple of hours, a co-worker and I found the problem and submitted a patch to the maintainer.<p>Funnily enough, the imap-maildir page still references this event even today (it probably hasn&#x27;t been updated in years):<p><a href=""http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.davideous.com&#x2F;imap-maildir&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.davideous.com&#x2F;imap-maildir&#x2F;</a><p>Under the section &quot;10-digit unix date rollover problem&quot;.
But it drive home to me as a fairly young sysadmin at the time of the dangers (at least for the inexperienced) of using third-party patches just in order to enable a non-standard mailbox format (eg. Maildir)."

In the end, the problem is due to the massive scale of human consumption on this planet. The mitigation might be just as bad when you consider the scale at which you have to produce the &#x27;better&#x27; solution."

"Not sure where the author is from, but I&#x27;m not aware of any states that still allow paper PCRs. ePCRs are just a fact of life.<p>I pretty much never bother opening the laptop until I&#x27;m at the hospital. There are a lot of reasons for that, but a laggy UX isn&#x27;t really one of them (despite the fact that the UX is indeed super laggy on any ePCR I&#x27;ve ever used). Instead I use a pen and paper (or a pen and a strip of white medical tape on my thigh, for a more critical patient).<p>The reason I don&#x27;t bother is because the whole UI is just too much of a hassle. Not the application frontend, the whole thing. The laptop, the keyboard, etc. With a pen and paper I don&#x27;t have to keep taking my gloves off and putting new ones on each time I need to switch from documenting something to caring for the patient (a pen is trivial to wipe down, or just toss if needed). With a pen and paper I can jot simple notes in a shorthand I&#x27;m familiar with, rather than having to navigate to the right page to enter the information I want to record at the moment.<p>I know very few providers that bother touching the laptop prior to arrival at the hospital. Generally we write notes on paper, then bring the laptop into the ER and start typing while we we&#x27;re waiting for a bed for our patient (it&#x27;s not uncommon that this takes long enough to get the whole chart written). At my agency we have two hours from when we transfer care to when the chart has to be signed off and locked.<p>I also chuckled at the suggestion that &quot;0.1% of PCRs have errors that waste an hour of a doctor&#x27;s time&quot;. In my experience 0.1% is pretty much how frequently the PCR gets reviewed at all in the ER, and anything important enough to spend an _hour_ on would have been mentioned up front during the transfer of care (nevermind the fact that an hour is an absurd amount of time for a doctor to be spending on a single patient)."

"Whenever I hear about a particular technique that is supposedly backed by evidence I wonder what specific protocol was used in the studies supporting it.  I also wonder how many studies have been conducted and for how many years.<p>For those of you who want an actual evidence-based practice check out Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR).  It&#x27;s the most frequently studied protocol and it&#x27;s been studied for decades.  When you read stories about studies showing how meditation does XYZ and ABC, it&#x27;s almost always MBSR that the researchers are using.<p>&quot;Meditation&quot; is a huge category, there&#x27;s a lot of stuff in there.  Some of it probably works, a lot of it doesn&#x27;t (other than the placebo effect).<p>What you think of as &quot;meditation&quot; may not be what actually has been researched in a given study.<p>Of course, all of the above is only applicable to those of you who want to pursue evidence-based techniques.  If you&#x27;re just satisfied with trying stuff you read about on random blogs and HN posts then go ahead and try anything: prayer, astrology, witchcraft, etc - you&#x27;ll probably realize a little positive benefit as long as you genuinely believe it will work."

"Vocabulary frequency lists have long been very popular with publishers, so I assume as well with language learners. The assumption behind these is that with knowledge of, say, 90% of the vocabulary you encounter, you will comprehend 90% of the writings you encounter. It doesn&#x27;t work out at all that way, though, because it is generally the low frequency vocabulary that carries the key information in a text and on which the interpretation of everything else hinges."
"I did this in 2013. Went from working in a lucrative, stressful high frequency trading systems development environment, into developing systems for humanitarian organizations. Loved the work, the next two years were the happiest and the most chilled out in my life. The negatives: burnt through a lot of my savings. I&#x27;m back in a different industry now, and the return was a bit painful, but looking back, it was one of the best decisions I&#x27;ve ever made.<p>Advice:<p>1. Have at least two years worth of savings, or an alternative source of income that can cover all your basic expenses, or don&#x27;t do it.<p>2. Don&#x27;t take a job that requires you to work harder than you did in your old job. In the beginning, the change will be invigorating, but soon it&#x27;ll start to wear you down. During my &quot;sabbatical&quot;, I worked only six hours a day at most, saving plenty of time for family and personal pursuits."

It seems to me that compilers could benefit from doing analysis of functions and providing that information to callers.
"I have solar panels on my roof. The were installed on top of regular roof tiles, since my house was already built by the time I was ready to install solar panels. But if you are building a new house, I think it makes a lot of sense to use Tesla Solar Roof. The roof looks great, you get clean energy and the warranty is for the lifetime of your house, or infinity (whichever comes first). From a personal standpoint, I wish these had been available when I built my house.
As for the gamle on Tesla&#x2F;Musk part, I would say that this is a long term, strategic move. More an more energy will come in the form of electricity. The solar panel market is full of chinese panels to put on top of your existing roof tiles. But in the future, when the &quot;normal&quot; will be to generate your own electricity, people will want the cool roof that looks like a normal roof. Not then weird &quot;add-on&quot;."

And as for the code, we included what we thought was a trivial nested for-loop problem and virtually nobody could even get started on it.<p>Is this kind of code problem too complicated in your opinion?

"Taxing businesses at all has been objected to as double taxation: the business is taxed, then the residual profits are distributed to shareholders, who are taxed. It isn&#x27;t a fringe idea: in 2015, many of the Republican candidates in the running for President stated they thought making corporate tax rates 0% would not only &quot;boost the economy&quot;, it would essentially remove all tax laws from the books, greatly simplifying things.<p>Superficially it sounds reasonable. But it isn&#x27;t. The US military spends $700B+ every year, often times very pointedly protecting the interests of US businesses. The state department has untold people spending billions more opening markets and making trade favorable for US businesses. By and large, the benefits to individuals is an afterthought -- what is good for US business is good for US citizens is the thinking.  Large swaths of the government function is spent optimizing conditions for business activity.<p>So, to get to the point: why should I pay higher tax to protect the business interests of Grumman, and GE, and farmers, and Apple, etc? Apple derives far more benefit and far more directly than I do.  Why aren&#x27;t they paying their portion of the taxes to support it? If part of the cost of doing business is running overseas bases so we can exert influence, that cost should be built into the business expenses as taxes, instead of being externalized to John Q. Public.<p>The answer is, of course, the super wealthy have captured government and a large part of the media which promotes their interests."

"how is this different from boring old evolutionary algorithms?<p>In my opinion the big breakthrough that enabled optimization and machine learning was the discovery of reverse mode automatic differentiation, since the space or family of all possible decision-functions is high dimensional, while the goal (survival, reproduction) is low dimensional. Unless I see a mathematical proof that evolutionary algorithms are as efficient as RM AD, I see little future in it, and apparently neither did biology since it decided to create brains.<p>It&#x27;s not an ideological stance I take here (of nature vs nurture).<p>For simplicity, lets pretend humans are single-cellular organisms, what does natural selection exert pressure on? our DNA code: both the actual protein codes and the promotor regions. I claim that variation on the proteins are risky (a modification in a proteinn coding region could render a protein useless) while a variation on the promotor regions is much less risky: altering a nucleotide there would slightly affect the affinity modulating transcription, so the cell would behave essentially the same but with different treshold concentrations, think of continuous parameters that describe our body (assuming same nurture, food, etc) some people are a bit taller, some people a bit stronger, etc... so how many of these continuous parameters do we have? On the order of the same number as the total number of promotor regions in DNA in the fertilized egg: both on human DNA and in one mitochondria (assuming there isn&#x27;t a chemical signals addressing and reading and writing scheme for say 10 mitochondria)...<p>EDIT: just adding that for a certain fixed environment, there are local (and a global) optimum of affinity values for each protein, so that near a local optimum the fitness is roughly shaped like -s(a-a_opt)^2 where s is spread and a_opt the local optimum affinity value. In other words, it is not so that &quot;better affinity&quot;, means fitter, not at all, a collection of genomes from an identical environment will hover around an affinity sweet spot.<p>According to wikipedia [0] that would result in about<p>about 2x 20412 &quot;floats&quot; for just protein-coding genes<p>about 2x 34000 &quot;floats&quot; when also including the pseudo-genes<p>about 2x 62000 &quot;floats&quot; when also including long ncRNA, small ncRNA, miRNA, rRNA, snRNA, snoRNA<p>these &quot;floats&quot; are the variables that allow a species to modulate the reaction constants in the gene regulatory network, since natural selection can not directly modulate the laws of physics and chemistry, and modulating the protein directly instead of the promotor region affinities &#x2F; reaction rates risks disfunctional proteins...<p>so my estimate of <i>an</i> upper limit of the number of &quot;floats&quot; in the genetic algorithm is ~120000 (and probably much less if not each of the above has a promotor region).<p>thats not a lot of information, if we think about the number of synaptic weights in the brain, and many of these are shared <i>in utilization</i> by the other cell types besides neurons.<p>I consider the possibility that: sperm cell, egg cell, or fertilized egg cell performs a kind of POST (power-on-self-test) that checks for some of the genes, although simply reaching the fertilized state may be enough of a selftest so no spontaneous abortion test may be needed (to save time and avoid resources spent on a probably malformed child).<p>[0] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Human_genome#Molecular_organization_and_gene_content"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Human_genome#Molecular_organiz...</a><p>EDIT2: regarding:<p>&gt;This makes WANNs particularly well positioned to exploit the Baldwin effect, the evolutionary pressure that rewards individuals predisposed to learn useful behaviors, without being trapped in the computationally expensive trap of ‘learning to learn’.<p>The computationally expensive trap of having to &#x27;learn to learn&#x27; could end up being as mundane as a low number of hormones to which neurons in the brain globally or collectively respond, which enables learning by reward or punishment, and from then on anticipating reward or punishment, and our individual end goal stems from this anticipation, and anticipating the anticipation etc..."

Of course one needs to be careful not to break anything else (issuing thousands of warning logs at the same time that the system is at peak load is probably not a good idea), but it shouldn&#x27;t be that difficult.

Thus, you can simplify the outcome of any risk into two categories: Internal Advantage &amp; External Advantage.<p>-- Note: I don&#x27;t use the term &quot;disadvantage&quot; as I prefer to force myself to think of things from a advantage&#x2F;standing perspective.

"This tariff situation is quickly becoming an amazing opportunity for developing countries. The labor shortages being talked about can only be resolved through higher wages, which means that the people at the bottom will get a cut of the new money. In the end the world will be a lot richer and the money will be in the hands of relatively livable countries like Vietnam. (The Vietnamese government is actually pretty good in terms of freedoms.)<p>It&#x27;s also politically preferable for the US to depend on a hundred small countries instead of one big competitor. It may also help cushion the next global recession, as each of these international markets will be less correlated with each other than one company in China is with another company in China.<p>Chinese companies are very tightly integrated with the government&#x27;s balance sheets, meaning that you can&#x27;t diversify within China.

"This part was especially depressing:<p><i>&gt; The California Air Resources Board restricts prescribed burns to days when pollution is at acceptable levels and the weather likely to disperse emissions from fire. In practice, this means that burning can occur only during a few weeks in the spring. In summer and autumn—the seasons when forests would burn naturally—the state’s air usually falls foul of the Clean Air Act. These are also the months that are most prone to uncontrollable wildfires, whose smoke is far more damaging to human health than that from prescribed fire. But, perversely, because wildfires are classified as natural catastrophes, their emissions are not counted against legal quotas.</i>"

"I tend to think that handwriting tells a lot about one&#x27;s upbringing and educational backgrounds.

I always make an excuse for me being a terrible handwriter because of that. But hey, I can now write while eating! (I still use chopsticks with my left hand.) Anyway, there&#x27;s a lot of characters (not pun intended) that one can learn from one&#x27;s kanji writing, because its blocky shape tends to reveal how rigid you follow the right stroke order, etc.<p>And then I found that the handwriting by Chinese people is awesome.

If you can perform the current task from muscle memory, you don’t upset working memory.  But as soon as you start having to think about it, and worse once you start editorializing in your head, things start to drop off.<p>Worst case results of this phenomenon have occurred when you finish a hard task and you have to ask yourself, “what was I doing?&#x2F;why was I doing this?”<p>So you want your tools to be unobtrusive. People who love hand tools know this. Somehow we do not."
The part which describes the development of Turbo is really cool.  It shows off the value of having an interactive development setup that allows for fast and intuitive iteration.<p>As a Googler I&#x27;m surprised to see such an interface internally.  Google systems have notoriously slow compile and test speeds for simple things (because the systems are optimized for very large projects). I think the difference between 500ms compilation and 10ms compilation is actually enormous.
A very interesting statement. The Hong Kong ISP Association makes a number of very good points. Much of Hong Kong&#x27;s economy relies on the open internet (like most of the world) and censoring it would do it much harm.

"Was waiting for an article like this to appear. I have an X1 and integration with iPhone is a disaster.<p>The Audible app on the iPhone will popup a warning that consists of the BMW logo taking up 80% of the screen with a small text warning at the bottom saying &quot;don&#x27;t use this while driving&quot; and a small &quot;x&quot; hidden somewhere to close the warning. It&#x27;s beyond ridiculous.<p>What gets me most is the Audm app on the iPhone. Whenever I get back in the car after using it, it will cause the car to start playing the same song from my Apple Music library. Always the same song, but randomly picked as far as I can tell (it&#x27;s not the last one I listened to nor or the first one alphabetically). It&#x27;s like an alarm clock - you end up hating the song because it comes on every single time you start the car. When I delete the song from my library it will just pick another one. When I stop using Audm, this annoyance stops. No idea what the logic behind this behavior is.<p>The BMW connect app is currently stuck in a loop where it says it&#x27;s &quot;doing something&quot;, even after having restarted my phone. So it&#x27;s currently unusable, guess I should reinstall it. This is an 80EUR app which I got so I can remote lock the car cause I always forget and people have helped themselves to stuff in my car so many times. The X1 doesn&#x27;t lock itself when I walk away, unlike the 116D did.<p>GPS - garbage interface compared to Waze which I can&#x27;t stop using despite my aversion to being tracked.<p>Great car, but many software annoyances."
"Ran into this issue way back in 2005 when I bought my first modern-ish car (Subaru Legacy.)  I&#x27;d always just replaced the radio with something decent and modern every few years in previous cars, but in this one the audio system was integrated into the HVAC controls and you couldn&#x27;t replace it.  So, no adding aux input jacks, nothing.  I sold that car after 2 years and bought a car that had a standard double din head unit.<p>I have a JVC head unit in my car now that does car play&#x2F;android auto, exterior cameras, etc. I will never buy another car without an upgradable stereo.  This usually means I&#x27;m shopping on the lower end of the market, but that&#x27;s worth it to not be stuck with auto manufacturer&#x27;s software."

"I started out my career as a 19 year old in business intelligence and old school data warehousing, and only in the last three years been able to properly apply my skills in the world of big data as a data engineer, and I&#x27;ve found that regardless of the fancy titles the kind of stuff I do is exactly the same. Perhaps the most surprising thing is that because &quot;data engineering&quot; is disassociated from the notion of traditional warehousing, you get lots of &quot;experts&quot; who have never heard of an ETL and think about software instead of data pipelines.<p>And with data scientists, I&#x27;ve found that it&#x27;s a mix of a) people who did mathematics or physics degrees suddenly getting into computer science b) senior analysts learning how to power up their analysis and c) computer science graduates who went on to do phd in data science<p>Working with them my humble opinion is that a) you can&#x27;t ignore the software aspect of your job, meaning that you need to understand basic database principles, parallel computing, SQL, etc. b) you also need to understand that it&#x27;s not about how fancy your algorithm is, but also how it can be quantified, how you can manage the life cycle, how you maintain it, etc."

"Why would anyone buy a 2018 MacBook? This problem has been in the news for over a year.

I don&#x27;t know if Apple realizes just how badly they messed up. I used to have an iPad, iPhone, home MacBook, and work MacBook, and even stupidly bought their overpriced Thunderbolt display out of some deranged brand loyalty. Now the only Apple product I still use is my iPad (because it hasn&#x27;t completely died yet), and when this goes, that&#x27;ll be it."
"I suppose you could saw that parsing <i>any</i> text-based protocol in general &quot;Is a Minefield&quot;. They look so simple and &quot;readable&quot;, which is why they&#x27;re appealing initially, but parsing text always involves lots of corner-cases and I&#x27;ve always thought it a huge waste of resources to use text-based protocols for data that&#x27;s not actually meant for human consumption the vast majority of the time.<p>Consider something as simple as parsing an integer in a text-based format; there may be whitespace to skip, an optional sign character, and then a loop to accumulate digits and convert them (itself a subtraction, multiply, and add), and there&#x27;s still the questions of all the invalid cases and what they should do. In contrast, in a binary format, all that&#x27;s required is to read the data, and the most complex thing which might be required is endianness conversion.

"I appreciate the struggle Feross has trying to get paid for his work. simple-peer and webtorrent are both pretty nice libraries and it is a real contribution to the world that he wrote them.<p>But, I don’t think this is going to work. npm install ads are like popup ads; they appear when you don’t want to see them and annoy your customers. Like popups, I think they will prove to be ineffective. Does Linode even <i>want</i> this ad? I think respectable companies would rather not annoy their customers like this.<p>I also think npm will ban this practice if it becomes widespread enough for them to bother - by my reading of npm’s rules they ban it already because they ban “adware”. If console.log becomes full of ads and useless during an npm install, it is pretty simple to disallow packages from displaying messages at install time.

Even CSS media queries aren&#x27;t safe as they can trivially be used for fingerprinting (and I have seen CSS where max-width was beeing queried in steps of 3 pixels out of sheer incompetence). Also caching&#x2F;timing &quot;attacks&quot; for fingerprinting. And finally, arbitrary JavaScript execution will be questioned, as it should&#x27;ve been a long time ago.

"Great job to the founders, awesome to see more cool companies out of the UW nano program.<p>Curious why all the negativity, perhaps people are unaware that cannabis actively DOES impair driving to dangerous levels.

A zero tolerance policy for smoking + driving within <i>days</i> is unreasonable and thus will be ineffective.

"I was reading the source code for a NES assembler written in pre-C99 C, and there was an odd C feature used in it that I haven&#x27;t really seen anywhere else.<p>It was before C had built-in booleans and the author had defined their own, but true was:<p><pre><code>    void * true_ptr  = &amp;true_ptr;
</code></pre>
true_ptr is a pointer to itself. So however many times you deference it:<p><pre><code>    printf(&quot;%p\n&quot;, true_ptr);
    printf(&quot;%p\n&quot;, &amp;true_ptr);
    printf(&quot;%p\n&quot;, *((void**)true_ptr));
    printf(&quot;%p\n&quot;, *((void**)*((void**)true_ptr)));
</code></pre>
You get the same pointer:<p><pre><code>    0x5555fefe715b
    0x5555fefe715b
    0x5555fefe715b
    0x5555fefe715b
</code></pre>
I still think that it&#x27;s neat that, even with ASLR, you have an address at compile time that you know won&#x27;t collide with address space of malloc results, or the address space of your stack.<p>Also you can declare the pointer as const and the value it points to as const and, if your kernel faults on writing to readonly memory pages, you get a buggier version of a NULL pointer that only segfaults on write.<p>Also it takes a second to figure out why the position of the const matters even though the pointer&#x27;s value is the value of the pointer, and why only one of these segfaults on write:<p><pre><code>    const void * const_pointer = &amp;const_pointer;
    void * const const_value   = &amp;const_value;</code></pre>"

"Well I threw together a system which assigns a guid to each request and reports this guid to the user if something goes wrong.

There is no proof in science and we observe it doesn&#x27;t suffer from wholesale collapse.<p>Things being proved in mathematics are unlikely to be wildly wrong even without proof. Fermat&#x27;s theorem being an example of one that took a very long time to be proved and basically nothing changed when it was. We were already convinced it was true by brute force failure to find a counter example. This lack of proof but search for counter-example is basically the scientific method. Is A equivalent to B?

"I have a pet theory that saving children from natural deaths is harmful to future generations. Surely by intervening so much, we&#x27;re giving unhealthy people as much evolutionary advantage as healthy people. If the whole world reaches western standards of infant mortality and stays there long enough, will children eventually become dependent on even more interventions and be even more vulnerable to death without them? It might take a lot of generations, but aren&#x27;t we supposed to value future humans higher than present ones because there will be more of them?<p>I would have died in childhood without modern medicine, and have a lifelong illness as a consequence of surviving. I may pass that on to my own children. That&#x27;s a problem that never happened in all human history before about a 100 years ago when useful medicine started to exist, so maybe its effects will be disastrous for the human race. On the other hand, perhaps it&#x27;s OK if we evolve more dependency on technology.

Neither?<p>- what version of Swagger or OpenAPI are you using?<p>- etc.<p>Sure, it&#x27;s great to see ongoing development of schemas, but with each new development we have yet another dialect to consider&#x2F;support.<p>In my view, perhaps an even greater problem with structured data formats in general is the void that separates them from programming languages esp. static languages such as Java where static type information is otherwise leveraged.

"I would be curious to compare this to smoking an actual cigarette to see if there is any difference. Inhaling any vapor&#x2F;smoke that isn&#x27;t meant for your lungs is going to cause damage and it would be neat to see a comparison between the two.<p>Anecdotal story time:<p>My grandfather who is currently 81, has been smoking since he was 12. He grew up in a very small town, and had 6 people in his graduating class other than himself.<p>Around January of this year, during a visit he seemed inquisitive as to the vaping device I was using. He still at this time was smoking 1.5-2 packs a day of roll-your-own cigarettes.<p>The reason he still was smoking so much is he has severe health issues from being legally blind from diabetes, and having extreme back pain since he returned from the service. In his hold age the only place he can sit and relax is this very old chair that sits on his porch that for whatever reason the angle on it relieves his back pain. He sits on that porch, smoking I would say 85% of his time, and the habit of playing with cigarettes while sitting there was the biggest factor.<p>After inquiring about my device and having me explain it to him he wanted to buy one right away and get on the e-cig bandwagon. I was skeptical as he has a whole multitude of health issues and if I were to switch him without consultation and something were to happen the guilt would be very great and I could not live with that.<p>I went with him to one of his visits to the V.A. and he brought up the subject of e-cigs to his doctor. We all had a conversation that pretty much came to the conclusion that continuing to smoke cigarettes wouldn&#x27;t be any better than e-cigs, and there is always a chance that the e-cig could be worse but there was nothing definitive.<p>I was able to get him to transition to smoking 0% nicotine juice, with a higher PV&#x2F;VG ratio (from what I&#x27;ve gathered online in smoker forums high VG juice tends to inflame those with asthma more than the PG). He did use nicotine patches for two weeks when he came off the cigarettes.<p>He slipped up and did smoke about 3 cigarettes during this transition, but starting the beginning of February he has been nicotine free and smoking the e-cig.<p>He recently had a lung test or something where they measure your 02 etc. He had said when he was smoking his 2 packs a day that his 02 was at 65% or so, and that it had gotten up to 78% at his last test.<p>Now I&#x27;m not a doctor and there are probably a billion variables that are unaccounted for, however he said that his breathing is much easier and doesn&#x27;t have a hard time sleeping when it is hot and humid out as much as before. For him the switch seems to be working with regards to his lungs&#x2F;breathing.<p>As far as other issues becoming more exacerbated because of this, only time will tell I guess.<p>He does want to quite completely, I suggested switching to sugar free candies or something to keep his oral fixation at bay while he sits in his chair. He seemed open to the idea, but like most smokers it really is a mental game and trying to get him to change his ways is pretty tough as he is a stubborn old man."
I have &quot;pi-holed&quot; my openbsd router using both ip blocklists for the firewall and dns blocklists for unbound that refresh automatically every night.<p>All my clients run firefox with ublock origin and https everywhere.

I have also turned off wasm support in firefox.<p>If a site doesn&#x27;t work with the above or shoves large nasty inline popups with &quot;we value your privacy&quot; etc and do not show a clear reject button I leave.<p>edit: I also pay subscription to most of the websites I use often that support payment and if they don&#x27;t I email them and tell that I don&#x27;t want ads and that I&#x27;d like to pay for it.

"Nice!  I&#x27;d would love to replace my custom system with this if some of the following features were implemented:<p>- A subcategory or tagging system.  When viewing the budget, I could just filter those items.  This would be nice for my side business stuff, so I could have categories like &quot;biz-&gt;income&quot; and &quot;biz-&gt;hosting&quot;, and then just view the &quot;biz&quot; category to see multiple flows.  Or more simply, I don&#x27;t necessarily need subcategories if I could just view multiple budget categories in one view.<p>- When choosing a category when approving transactions, it would be nice to be able to type to search the category<p>- Also when approving transactions, when I click on the checkmark, I&#x27;d prefer if they either disappeared instantly or just didn&#x27;t disappear at all.  Right now I&#x27;m afraid to click multiple items quickly since I might mis-click when it disappears unexpectedly, clicking on the next line.  I think it&#x27;s important to remove all friction from the transaction approval section, since that&#x27;s the most commonly used part.<p>- How do I categorize recurring expenses?  It doesn&#x27;t seem like I can.  Why not?<p>- Some way of showing big, unique groups of expenses, such as a wedding, or vacation, or buying a computer.  I wouldn&#x27;t want to factor that into my monthly budget, but I&#x27;d like to see the total costs of this years &quot;special expenses&quot;.  Maybe I could tag transactions as &quot;coast trip&quot; or &quot;gaming pc&quot; or &quot;wedding&quot;, and then view all special expenses as their own category?"
"I came from a big family, and I have 6 children.<p>I have taught all my children to read using McGuffey. I helped many of my siblings learn to read. Much of the discussion around phonics is missing the point.<p>It is a caricature to say that &quot;phonetic&quot; reading is completely phonetic to the exclusion of sight reading. This is binary thinking. Nobody teaches it that way.<p>The goal is not and never was to read phonetically ever after. In fact, from very early on, the concept of &quot;sight words&quot; is introduced. The phonetic method is a bridge and a tool to internalize words. The goal is to recognize words effortlessly, without thought.<p>So what is the difference between the old phonetic methods, the later sight methods, and the modern (debunked) contextual methods?<p>It&#x27;s all about where you start. The phonetic method uses phonics as its foundational concept. You begin with the sounds, and you learn the exceptions as you go. But even the exceptions are aided by phonetics. Most &quot;sight&quot; words still have enough of a phonetic component to clue the reader into what&#x27;s going on.<p>Sight reading, on the other hand, assumes the reader will pick up enough phonics as they go along, contextually. But with this method, everything must be learned by rote. The &quot;bridge&quot; of having phonetic tools at your disposal is not taught.<p>Now some children are simply sight readers, and do poorly with phonics. Not all minds are alike. But even sight readers benefit from having a foundation in phonics."

"I gotta say I am surprised and a little disheartened by all the negativity around this post and Fowler in general. Fowler&#x27;s writing has been a huge inspiration to me in my career. I&#x27;m about to gift a copy of his book &quot;Refactoring&quot; to one of the junior engineers I work with for instance.<p>I think the idea of an architecture as a social construct is very fitting. Software is hard when multiple people are working on it with differing backgrounds and experience. Having a rough outline (emphasis on rough here) of &quot;what lives where&quot; and &quot;what is allowed to talk to what&quot; is absolutely critical IMO. It&#x27;s how your team can effectively reason about a system and add new features to it. It should also be a living thing in that it&#x27;s something that is continually refined, discussed, and changed as the needs of the business change. Done right, its an organic process that really helps deliver more robust software that everyone involved has a high level understanding of.<p>Contrast that with an Architecture (capital A) done in Enterprise which delivers a static artifact that does not allow for any creativity and micromanages every aspect of it. It&#x27;s split off into chunks and no one without an expert level of knowledge can easily understand it. That kind of design will almost certainly fall over the first time there needs to be a change to it. It&#x27;s important to point out the difference because that is NOT what Fowler is recommending in his writings."

At least Apple&#x27;s policies seem to have a tangible trade-off.<p><i>Android gives customers hardware choices!</i> Oh wait— the choice is between a cheap device that got its final software update five days after it shipped, a mid-tier device that <i>might</i> get updated next year, or a flagship which will probably get next year&#x27;s major update and only security fixes thereafter.<p><i>Android gives customers software choices!</i> Oh wait— what&#x27;s the current messaging platform that Google is pushing this month? Do you, the human reading this paragraph, <i>really</i> care if there are eight hundred or eight thousand camera apps in your phone&#x27;s app store?"

"Most of these are due to the cruft added in C99 and later.<p>Compile-time trees are possible without compound literals.<p>More than twenty years ago, I made a hyper-linked help screen system a GUI app whose content was all statically declared C structures with pointers to each other.<p>At file scope, you can make circular structures, thanks to tentative definitions, which can forward-declare the existence of a name, whose initializer can be given later.<p>Here is a compile-time circular list<p><pre><code>   struct foo { struct foo *prev, *next; };

   struct foo n1, n2; &#x2F;* C90 &quot;tentative definition&quot; *&#x2F;

   struct foo circ_head = { &amp;n2, &amp;n1 };

   struct foo n1 = { &amp;circ_head, &amp;n2 };

   struct foo n2 = { &amp;n2, &amp;circ_head };
</code></pre>
You can&#x27;t do this purely declaratively in a block scope, because the tentative definition mechanism is lacking.<p>About macros used for include headers, those can be evil. A few years ago I had this:<p><pre><code>   #include ALLOCA_H  &#x2F;* config system decides header name *&#x2F;
</code></pre>
Broke on Musl. Why? ALLOCA_H expanded to &lt;alloca.h&gt;. But unlike a hard-coded #include &lt;alloca.h&gt;, this &lt;alloca.h&gt; is just a token sequence that is itself scanned for more macro replacements: it consists of the tokens {&lt;}{alloca}{.}{h}{&gt;}. The &lt;stdlib.h&gt; on Musl defines an alloca macro (an object-like one, not function-like such as #define alloca __builtin_alloca), and that got replaced inside &lt;alloca.h&gt;, resulting in a garbage header name."

"I&#x27;m somewhat surprised that Mozilla went this route, because I recall during discussions, there was concern that explicitly blacklisting a country&#x27;s root CA could lead the country to simply fork and release its own nation-state browser with the root CA trusted. That would be bad for everyone for many reasons, not the least of which being that the nation-state forked browser would likely be perpetually behind the main branch in terms of bugfixes and security updates.<p>Maybe because Google agreed to do the same?"

"I&#x27;m a deer hunter.  I&#x27;m out in the woods scouting a few times in the late summer, then I&#x27;m out there every day in the fall for about two months.<p>I treat everything with permethrine:  clothes, socks, boots, hats, orange vest, backpack, ground blind, even the tripod chair I sit on in the blind.  Permethrine, derived from the chrysanthemum flower, kills ticks (as well as ants and bees).  If one lands on your pants or shirt, it will quickly die.  But permethrine is considered harmless to mammals once it&#x27;s dry.  It also doesn&#x27;t hurt to spray some deet on your exposed skin (face, hands etc.).  Permethrine survives several washings.<p>As soon as I come back from a hunt, I strip and take a hot scrub shower.  This is probably the best way to rid them from your body before they latch on, which usually takes a few hours up to 24 or so before they settle in a desirable spot.<p>Reducing the deer population is an excellent way to reduce the adult tick vector; deer can travel quite far and spread tick populations quickly.<p>The nymph phase of the tick life cycle is slightly different; they are on mice and other rodents until they reach a certain size.  You can actually reduce this population by putting out tick tubes everywhere in your yard, under brush, under wood piles, wherever rodents might tend to go.  The tubes contain cotton or dryer lint sprayed with permethrine; the rodents take bits of the material back to line their nests, and it kills the baby ticks.  I do this every spring, in the hopes it will rid the vicinity of many ticks.<p>Lyme is serious business and once you get it, it can take years if not forever to get rid of.  Lymerix was a vaccine developed in the 1990s that was about 80% effective, but unfortunately an anti-vaccine group sued the company successfully and they pulled it off the market.  The CDC subsequently determined there was no validity to the plaintiff&#x27;s claims, but by then the deed was done.  Probably hundreds of thousands of people suffer from Lyme today because of this lawsuit.<p>There are new vaccines in the pipeline that sound very promising; they target common proteins among the family of Lyme bacteria (there are about a dozen known species of borrelia bacteria) so that one shot should protect you.  Of course, promising doesn&#x27;t mean guaranteed, so we&#x27;ll just have to wait and hope this thing can be beaten.<p>In the meantime, we can focus on attacking the vectors:  reduce the overpopulation of deer and rodents that carry the ticks, encourage more use of permethrine and other insecticides.  Monhegan Island, off the Maine coast, had 25% prevalence of the disease until they eradicated the deer population (originally brought there in the 1950s-60s as a tourist attraction) and new cases of Lyme went down to almost nil.<p>We can encourage more predators like hawks and owls and snakes, all of which work to keep the rodent population in check.  Flocks of birds eat ticks, but bird populations have greatly decreased in recent decades, so we might think about ways to bring them back, perhaps through reforestation and limiting exurban development that removes habitat."

"The essay is remarkably prescient.<p>Brooks dared to predict that thirty years later, software would still be created by programmers sitting in front of editors, painstakingly typing up code branches for all of the scenarios a given program is supposed to handle.

Complexity that cannot be abstracted away.<p>Given how starry-eyed we usually are about even the near future, that is bold.<p>The web, language advances, tooling - these are quality-of-life improvements. They don&#x27;t &#x27;solve&#x27; the inherent complexity of software development, the way it was promised by CASE tools (Brooks&#x27; likely target with his essay) and countless other &#x27;business oriented&#x27; approaches. In fact those approaches have failed so many times that they have been largely abandoned, so in recent times, Brooks&#x27; essay might seem superfluous.<p>The one advance that might finally challenge the &#x27;no silver bullet&#x27; rule is machine learning. Not yet, given that it is still an esoteric tool for a specialized class of problems, as part of traditional software systems. But with increasing computing power, I can imagine a future where machine learning can be set to work on broader tasks and start to look like magic self-directed software development."
"&gt; ‘We thought that, in general, all of these amino acids would react similarly because they are structurally similar,’ says Leman.

"It’s surprising and a little disappointing when articles like this don’t include photos. It was a really interesting read, but I had a hard time visualizing the “healthy” forest that the writer described at the end.<p>Meanwhile it is interesting how many of the problems we face are principally cultural in nature. Just as the “dense, dark European forest” isn’t actually healthy in California, there are a great many other aspects of contemporary life in the US, especially in the Southwest, that are not healthy, but are cling to by most people as part of their cultural narrative. Monoculture grass lawns and parking lots at every destination come to mind, but there are many, many examples.<p>I wonder if and when we’ll ever learn effective ways to bring about culture change when called for. It seems like being able to and interested in moving in small increments would be key, but often times the scale of change that the scientists &#x2F; visionaries &#x2F; leaders are calling for don’t translate into incremental change in obvious ways. Further, the people leading the charge generally want to see sweeping paradigm shift, and often oppose incremental change as “half-measures.”<p>These are tough problems to solve, but I’m optimistic that some of the lessons that have become widely known in software world (agile, etc) will be able to productively translate into the broader society."

Had to use this to improve the speed of our admin user search after the table got fairly large (&gt;1mil). The biggest problem was that it&#x27;s a general search that searched display_name as well as email. We ended up cleverly omitting the email search unless &#x27;@&#x27; was included in the search string.

This is a huge incentive for the independent and open source maker and hacker community to create modifications for cars. Major auto manufacturers need to throw in the towel on developing their own SDKs and operating system and become more friendly to users who want deeper integration with the rest of their internet-enabled lives.
"I hear there are people protesting outside embassies about the Amazon fires. I agree with that, but I hope people carry it through to protesting Australian embassies aswell.

"The next wave of interesting startups will be shelter. Not housing that keep people comfy at night, but effective walkable citylike places. Places that take into account that the human race is very social. Places that makes it easy to be friendly to the environment.<p>Poundbury in southern UK was nothing but greenfields. Now it’s a highly succesfyl city that attracts people and businesses, despite 1&#x2F;3 of the buildings being affordable houses projects. Good cities reduces the inhabitants need for long distance travels."
"Interesting essay.<p>Related to time anxiety, Oliver Burkeman pointed out the paradox of &quot;making good use of time&quot;. Taken too far, it turns time into an instrumental goal.

"At the time I did my AI post-grad, there were broadly speaking 3 schools of thought on how general AI would be achieved: via (i) symbolic AI (or &quot;classic  AI&quot;), (ii) connectionist AI (i.e. neural networks, now &quot;deep learning&quot;), and (iii) what they called &quot;robotic functionalism&quot;. It sounds like this article is referring to the last group, i.e. that embodiment in and interaction with the physical world are a necessary requirement for general intelligence. Can&#x27;t find any references to it by this term, but as others have noted this is not a new idea. Personally, I&#x27;ve never been convinced by the idea that you <i>had</i> to have physical presence, and sometimes suspected the theory existed to allow robotics to fall within the AI camp, but that said I do think hybrid solutions (i.e. the combination of more than one &quot;narrow&quot; approaches) are one of the most promising areas right now."

"So, it all makes sense, but by this theory, it seems like the english words &quot;through&quot; and &quot;tough&quot; and &quot;benign&quot; should be really hard to learn, compared to &quot;true&quot; and &quot;stuff&quot; and wine&quot;.  Also, English ought to be harder to learn to read than, say, German or Spanish.  But I don&#x27;t know of any evidence that English-speaking countries have lower literacy than Spanish- or German-speaking countries.<p>I don&#x27;t mean that phonics isn&#x27;t useful, but the idea that having multiple strategies can kill your ability to read sounds fishy."
Cool idea. I like how it times out even while backspacing.

"&gt; Something like a quarter-second lag when you opened a dropdown or clicked a button<p>So the title would more accurately be &quot;UI responsiveness matters&quot;?

"<i>I was talking with the guy who ultimately edited this book, and his son had just watched Star Wars, his 4-year-old-son, and was very affected by it. And I kind of had this theory that when you&#x27;re a very young person, the character in Star Wars you care about the most or like the most is Luke Skywalker, who&#x27;s this, you know, wholly good, heroic, almost naively pure kind of character.</i><p><i>And then you become, you know, 12 years old, a teenager, and you gravitate toward Han Solo, who seems like a bad person, but ultimately he is good. And when you&#x27;re kind of going through adolescence, you sort of like the idea of being perceived as a dangerous individual, even though you still sort of identify as being good.</i><p><i>&quot;But when you really become adult, you&#x27;re no longer looking at characters — fictional or unfictional — as aspirational. You kind of are the person you are. And now when you look at characters, you kind of want to see things in them that help you understand yourself. So I feel, as an adult, the character you care about the most is Darth Vader. The maturation process seems to move a person toward relating to and understanding villainous personalities.</i><p>-Chuck Klosterman<p><a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.npr.org&#x2F;2013&#x2F;07&#x2F;09&#x2F;200141185&#x2F;chuck-klosterman-on-batman-bad-guys-and-wearing-the-black-hat"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.npr.org&#x2F;2013&#x2F;07&#x2F;09&#x2F;200141185&#x2F;chuck-klosterman-on...</a>"
"Rather than disappear it from the Store entirely, it would be nice if Google could leave a placeholder with a warning; at least it would serve an educational purpose.<p>Also, does the Play Store app have a way to notify users of a banned app that is still installed? I decided to check my wife&#x27;s phone proactively, but I don&#x27;t think she would otherwise have had a clue of malware (but has been getting weird and annoying pop-up ads)."
This is stupid. The entire point of the electoral college is to ensure small states have a say and the country isn’t ruled by the majority mob. Small states would have to be pretty ignorant to make themselves irrelevant like that.
It&#x27;s inspiring how quickly ad tech devs can band together to completely remove all ads from their ad tech development environment.
"This is running MO for comp sci: adding loads of complexity for a minor gain.<p>Compile-time borrow-checking works for self-contained applications--the compiler has a complete picture of what&#x27;s going on.  Move that model inside kernel space--where blobs are being mutated across separately compiled modules, different chipsets (CPU&#x2F;DMA&#x2F;GPU), sometimes even in parallel--might as well wrap the whole thing in a big `unsafe` block.<p>Somebody&#x27;s going to say &quot;<i>Oh, you&#x27;re exaggerating.

"I&#x27;m going to keep saying this in every goddamn tax thread I see here - We need to switch around the way we are taxing from the US level getting the largest pie to the state. I&#x27;m not saying I figured it out - but right now there are enormous issues with the way we tax.<p>1. We have a system where the fed. government holds states hostage for money when it wants to bully things around. (emergencies, etc..).<p>2. The current system is actively encouraging people to domicile in TX, FL, WA, SD, etc... (income tax free states) and not actually live there, hoping to play the tax lottery (or move around so much they can&#x27;t be convicted).<p>3. The &quot;sales tax&quot; system in the US is ridiculous. It&#x27;s egregiously illegal according to our tax-once rule. If we can get a tax break on all sales tax we paid, that would be one thing, but we can&#x27;t.<p>4. Ind. contractors are taxed in extremely unfair ways, often have no recourse to get discounts or tax breaks on health insurance.<p>My solution -<p>I say it&#x27;s time to start having states collect that 25% and the feds are hands-off of taxing individuals. Beyond that it would make sense for people to declare a state of residence (one that they most want roads repaired at, police hired, etc..). Get rid of sales tax completely - it&#x27;s a massive waste of time if states are getting a fair amount. Move MOST fed employees to the state level and remove major govt. contractors that are bilking the public (in the long run companies like Northrup Gruman etc.. are paying the heads billions each - there&#x27;s no oversight.). Remove the national army and start creating state-armies. Re-write the constitution that changes how states operate within the federal level, and completely change the role of the federal government to be allowed to make laws that are scoped towards fairness across states. Make the fed. government in charge of analytics and cross-state environmental regulation. States would then have the right to make laws that apply to the people.<p>Some might say this is ridiculous but in a time where we getting to the &quot;end of capitalism&quot; a MASSIVE re-write to how money is moved around is damn fucking necessary."
"Some friends and I wrote something similar as satire during undergrad. It’s ridiculous, but I was (and still am) pleased how it rolls off the tongue.<p><a href=""http:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.mit.edu&#x2F;kade&#x2F;www&#x2F;misc&#x2F;ieee4919.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.mit.edu&#x2F;kade&#x2F;www&#x2F;misc&#x2F;ieee4919.pdf</a>"
"My current job -- now 12 years -- has always been work from home, but I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s necessarily &quot;remote work.&quot;<p>I say this because this company has no office space anywhere. EVERYONE works from home. We&#x27;re small (~10), but spread out over the whole US. I have coworkers I&#x27;ve never actually seen in the flesh, and I only see my boss a couple times a year.<p>This works very well for us. I&#x27;d have a hard time going back to an office. But it&#x27;s not &quot;remote&quot; in the sense that some folks are in an office and some folks aren&#x27;t, which I think makes our WFH different from &quot;remote work.&quot;"
I feel lucky to personally know Google employees. The times when I&#x27;ve had an issue and gone via the public channels there has been radio silence. Directly report it via a google employee and it generally gets dealt with. It should not be this way.
"This is a very good point that I wish would get more attention: &quot;Politics is an organizational problem, not a technological one.&quot;, &quot;If we want to lower the cost of living, the cost of housing, the cost of doing business in the Bay Area, tech must get involved in politics.&quot;<p>People don&#x27;t realize how conservative SF is: &quot;The most innovative solutions don’t matter when your government has been captured by interests that want to freeze the city in amber&quot;   SF won&#x27;t even allow companies to put more buses on the road (something that would benefit everyone!)<p>This was news to me: &quot;Support for More HOMES in San Francisco was even stronger, at 74%. Despite this popular support, every member of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors voted to oppose More HOMES, except for Asha Safai and Vallie Brown &quot;  It seems that politics in SF doesn&#x27;t represent the majority view.<p>This is part of a much larger set of problems.  As we continue into the future all the tech problems get solved or already have been solved.  What we&#x27;re left with is all the problems that can&#x27;t be solved: those are all political.  There will come a day when instead of starting software companies, we&#x27;ll be starting companies that solve political problems."
"Why does this post have so many points? How is that article useful to most readers? I sometimes don&#x27;t understand HN.<p>Performance matters... the article talks about a case that most of us aren&#x27;t confronted with.<p>Beside, it concludes that in spite of paper being slower, it&#x27;s still prefered, so how does that prove that &quot;performance matters&quot;?!<p>Should an article be upvoted just because an article is about life and death and has a catchy (pretentiously) laconic title?"
"Not just software developers.  I was working on a medical device and visited doctors&#x27; offices to see how and where they stored their medication (e.g. for how could we make our dispenser more prominent without getting in the way?).

"The interesting thing is that wages have remained stagnant as productivity has increased dramatically. Which means that our labor has been valued less over time. What needs to happen is that the work week shortens while the minimum wage increases in kind. Top execs need to be comfortable making less, as they are the only ones profiting off these productivity increases."

"The point about optimism is very interesting and I completely agree re: ambition - hard problems are more feasible than easy ones. However, I don&#x27;t agree with the point about ad clicks.<p>&gt; &quot;Ambitious problems for Stripe look like enabling more internet businesses and supporting entrepreneurs in more countries, not getting more ad clicks.&quot;<p>I used to have a similar mindset until I actually ended up working on Ads at Google. There are hundreds of thousands (if not millions) of small business merchants, mom and pop stores, etc that rely on ads (be that Google, Facebook, Instagram, whatever) to run their businesses. In fact, these are the vast majority of ad buyers! The huge multi-billion dollar corporations are far and few between.<p>That&#x27;s what drove many of the engineers (including myself). A small increase in conversion ratio (be that through better ranking, filtering, query interpretation, etc) meant a huge deal to these merchants and in some cases, could be the difference between life and death for some of these small companies. And at the scale Google operates at, very small incremental changes = huge impact. The engineers and projects, at least in my team, were driven by exactly the same goals mentioned here - to &quot;enable more businesses&quot; and &quot;support entrepreneurs&quot; all across the world.<p>It&#x27;s easy to get sucked into the hype and blanket statements of &quot;ads are bad&quot; (I was guilty of that too). I&#x27;ve since left Google, but that experience really internalized for me that things like this are never so black and white."
"I learned Perl4 in grad school and it was a life changing tool to automate my analysis workflow.  With it I was able to script complex solutions that drove stepper drivers and CCD cameras on a microscope for data and image collection.<p>I stayed through the Perl5 change over and thought it was good.  Then I tried OO programming.  And cried.  And read that Perl 6 would make it better. But I needed something now, on a windows box, and free. That was 2003.<p>I tried Python and loved it.<p>Higher Order Perl made me appreciate what Perl could do, but the state of Perl 6 and lack of progress kept me away, as the features I most wanted were always fixes coming real soon now.<p>I STILL program python.  Perl had me and lost me.  Perl might not be dead, but it is dead to me."
"I use RSS for everything I do on the internet: news, other websites, subreddits, craigslist, hn, even journal articles.<p>On pubmed, you can generate an rss feed from any boolean search string you want (some of mine are for journals, authors, or keywords). It spits out the abstracts and I can skim over hundreds of articles in not that much time and keep track of colleagues."
"I think a lot of posts here completely missed the point of the article, which is NOT about the role of architects in pure software products such as websites.<p>The author is talking about large defense systems like satellite arrays and airplanes. The status quo that the author is responding to is that engineers of the physical systems (missiles, satellites, etc.) make all the decisions with software bolted on after the fact. This is definitely true at places like Boeing.<p>You could replace architect with &quot;senior software engineer&quot; or whatever.<p>Point is, software should have some seat at the table during the design process.<p>The fundamental thesis of the piece is: &quot;If, instead, system acquirers ensure that systems engineers address software concerns at the same time as the physical solution is conceptualized, acquirers can opt for a slightly different physical system, whose software architecture is tuned to optimize the provided capabilities.&quot;<p>Which, to me, sounds entirely reasonable. If some system needs an MLOC or so and the software will be doing a complex thing like piloting the aircraft, you better be thinking about the software from the beginning of the project..."
"The other side of the coin is after you&#x27;ve built a few startups, you see the same pattern coming up again and again. Part of being creative is to know where to focus your attention (I.e. figuring out PMF) rather than wasting cycles on problems with clear solutions."
"It&#x27;s nice to hear that there appears to be progress being made in making git&#x27;s tooling nicer and more consistent. Git&#x27;s model itself is pretty simple, but the command line tools for working with it aren&#x27;t and I feel that this fuels most of the &quot;Git is hard&quot; complaints."
I will invest in this company because I love the product and so does everyone I know who uses it.<p>But the general and administrative costs in 2019 seem ridiculously high. The tender offer last year only makes up 1&#x2F;3 of that increase. What&#x27;s up with that?

Just go with normal vulnerability disclosure. Bug bounty programs are a two way street, and respecting the scope is part of that.<p>Edit: I guess the important part is that the researcher was then banned for disclosing the report.

"I think this anxiety comes from deep inside of me reminding that I&#x27;ve lost myself in that moment. It helps to just stop doing whatever I am doing, shut off my mind, turn to myself, and re-establish the connection with my inner self, which I tend to loose sometimes in the everyday hectic.<p>And what also helps me to retain and to strengthen this connection is simply love. Basically, to replace the negative thoughts, ambitions, etc. with truly positive values and things, to start caring about the people around, doing something good for the others without expecting anything in exchange and many other good things, which I&#x27;d never thought of before.<p>The books here have helped me to make the first step back then and are still helping me to stay on this way:<p><a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;allatra-book.org&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;allatra-book.org&#x2F;</a><p>Hope they help someone else as well."

There is an ISO guidelines on software system requirements and specifications that has a section for performance requirements. It does matter even for banal, non-critical or non-life-threatening software systems.<p>Another often-overlooked requirement: environment. Does the human using your software system have to pay attention to more important situations around them? Is the environment they&#x27;re using your software in noisy, stressful, dangerous or dirty? Should you expect frequent wireless interference or degraded wireless performance?<p>Reading the ISO specs are pretty boring, so is the SWEBOK guide, but it&#x27;s rather interesting to think about software in terms of the whole system and not as an artifact unto itself."

"gcc has some attributes to help with that, for example try __attribute__((pure)) on funcs that will always return the same thing for the same inputs (given the same global state) and do not modify said input or state (and thus can be called more or fewer times than programmer wrote). Usually gcc will be quite aggressive with optimizations if you use that.<p>For even more aggressiveness, try __attribute__((const)) which tells it that the func accesses NOTHING but the params, not even global vars. Of course this is quite limiting. You can also use this as a trick when <i>YOU</i> know that the only accessed global state is itself constant but gcc does not know that. This can produce substantial savings in number of calls of funcs that, for example, do lookups in large constant data tables, like table-based versions of sin() and cos().<p>In the example the article gives, adding __attribute__((pure)) to constFunc() does produce the  behaviour author wanted and then some<p>LWN has more: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lwn.net&#x2F;Articles&#x2F;285332&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lwn.net&#x2F;Articles&#x2F;285332&#x2F;</a>"

"Thanks for posting this.  One thing that I think really helps me is to have a reason for everything I do, better than pleasure&#x2F;power&#x2F;attention&#x2F;toys, that is relevant to both the long-term and the short-term.  So I know why, and that motivates me.  One problem I might have had is too much motivation and I have had to adjust, to re-balance.<p>I have decided that direction is more important than speed.  I.e., making sure the ladder of success is not leaning against the wrong wall (Covey), and that we are not running in circles, or spending our lifetime on mere shiny things.  What do we want to look back on after decades, or at the end of mortality?  I.e., good decision-making, keeping in mind the purpose of one&#x27;s life.  My purpose in life comes from my beliefs, but I think a next candidate for purpose could be joy, which I suppose comes from knowing one&#x27;s nature, and from learning&#x2F;growth, and unselfish service to others (helping them learn and grow and be well &amp; happy).<p>So, balance while moving forward well, based the above, to me is much more important than getting <i>more</i> tasks done (though I am very task-focused when I am able, because the tasks relate directly to the purpose and related specific goals).  This and other things help me feel peaceful and happy (life and learning are very much a work in progress, but some things I have gratefully learned).<p>I have written more at <a href=""http:&#x2F;&#x2F;lukecall.net"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;lukecall.net</a> (a lightly-loading, simple site), including about development of and candidate content for maturity models for different areas of life (mental, physical, social, spiritual).

On the net it&#x27;s typical to be contrary, but often in ways that aren&#x27;t especially imaginative or enjoyable for others unless they too just want to argue.<p>2) I can bypass someone else&#x27;s specifics and propose an alternative point of view, a fresh perspective or a confounding dependency that isn&#x27;t common knowledge.  This is likelier to introduce an element of surprise to the exchange, inviting others to dive deeper into the problem or solution space, encouraging others to employ more imagination and not be so binary in debating T&#x2F;F on each point of the assertions.<p>3) I can ask questions: for clarification, to suggest new dependencies or implications, or propose factors or mechanisms that aren&#x27;t necessarily contradictions but might be tangents or parallels or essential unknowns.<p>And if I do choose option #1, to openly disagree, I can voice it in a less confrontational style or focus on only the point I think is most interesting or essential (or amusing).<p>The writing style I choose makes a difference too.  Rather than making bold pronouncements, if I can couch a point as my opinion or a doubt I have, I can deflect rather than provoke.<p>In the end, I have to decide what I want from this exchange,  to discuss ideas or argue.

"This article has some interesting tips and useful encouragement but the system it outlines has a glaring hole: there is no objective feedback loop based upon <i>outcomes</i> back to the interviewer.  The author appears to encourage that interviewers seek feedback, but the message is not to look for data but <i>sentiment</i>:<p>“One way you can tell you’re proficient is that recruiters and hiring managers try to find ways to include you in their interview loops because they know you’ll both get the candidate excited and be able to assess their work fairly, even if they take an unusual approach.”<p>If recruiters and hiring managers want you on a panel, it signals that you’re unlikely to disrupt their pipelines by rejecting candidates.  This is especially true for high-growth companies (e.g. Twitter where ICs would do 8 onsites a week; I did 5 per week for years).  They like you not because you’re proficient but because you’re aligned.<p>Is it possible to be aligned and “wrong” ? Of course!  Invariably, gluttonous hiring practices result in the need for “bar raisers” to restore consistency, entire teams with no real focus, and an explosion of communication channels.  Hypergrowth is cancerous.  And if everybody is in it together, nobody will be hold another accountable.<p>This article outlines very little about proficiency and a lot about how to brainwash new grads into believing alignment itself with a recruiting process is a very special skill.

"&gt; <i>records the interactions of hackers</i><p>Before you get too excited, I would say that a common mistake of inexperienced sysadmins is assuming all those brute-force attempts in the logs are results of those &quot;hackers&quot; and &quot;crackers&quot;, it&#x27;s not, not even a scriptkid.<p>All you can get by running a honeypot, like this one, is pretty boring activities by soulless, ancient worms and viruses, or automatic global Internet scanners running 24x7, not humans. Most of those are not even worth your time to block (e.g. if you only use strong password or pubkey, there are few reasons to fail2ban).<p>It&#x27;s nothing personal. Any machine will be port scanned, vuln probed, brute forced, blindly hit with ancient &quot;1 shot&quot; exploits (e.g. ?file=..&#x2F;..&#x2F;..&#x2F;etc&#x2F;passwd ). This is how the Internet works.<p>Another lesson is: <i>never</i> run any unsecured webserver&#x2F;service on the public Internet, <i>never ever</i>, not even for debugging, period. Don&#x27;t listen 0.0.0.0:80 if you have just installed your PHP management system, don&#x27;t reset your forgotten MySQL password by disabling privilege checking before turning off networking first, if you just installed a new VPS with root password 123456 in a morning, don&#x27;t wait until afternoon, change it immediately, etc.<p>The reason is exact the opposite, not because of &quot;hackers&quot; but those stupid worms. Ordinary life is boring: if you run a webserver with password 123456 (e.g. for debugging an issue on a disposable server - just for 20 minutes, you think, then you forgot it), you won&#x27;t (or unlikely) to see someone hacking into your system, but it&#x27;s a certainty that one of those stupid worms&#x2F;viruses would infect your machine within hours, sometimes it&#x27;s as quick as having your lunch.

Careful maintenance would be needed to avoid putting other people&#x27;s ad code in yours, but also keep it up to date to fix exploits."

"Turned out to be more interesting than I thought, led to a nice perspective comparing the journey of typing to that of life, though I don&#x27;t generally believe in the afterlife as this may imply:<p>&gt;I&#x27;m writing words about things just kidding I&#x27;m just typing words to fill this thing up so far but I mean idk what the actual point of this thing is other than to be annoying. I guess I&#x27;ll try to form actual sentences. I just don&#x27;t understand why this would be made but I guess it&#x27;s to explore how a person types into something like this. Right now I&#x27;m already coming up with a narrative about my experience and opinions on this so that reflects some value I think. Really though I just wonder what made the creator of this come up with it. I just wish there was some explaination, which there probably is but I&#x27;ve yet to look at it. I wish I could have such an explaination here and now. Maybe this is sort of how life is, true explainations of what or why the things occuring at the moment exist, but are outside the scope of this existence. In the same way the truth of this journey of typing exists, but is not available to me while I&#x27;m typing. I could stop typing early and find out quicker, but that would make this typing sort of pointless.  I&#x27;m curious to know what happens when the bar reaches the end of the browser window, does it save the text perhaps? Maybe if I type enough I get to save it? That would make some sense and would be cool, but if not it still has been an interesting adventure in typing rapidly from currently occuring thoughts. I guess someone could try to plan what they write and write something about a certain topic, but overall it seems easier to just type what is on the mind. Oh well, looks like the bar is almost at the end."

"General advice: make sure you have a solution on all platforms. TV, IoT, phone on wifi, phone on mobile network, etc...<p>At home you need to first subvert your ISP.<p>Make sure you have a router doing blocking, like a PiHole. For mobile devices always use a VPN and DNS protection like dns-crypt. Use Cloudflare’s mobile DNS over HTTPS solution even though that’s a single point of failure, decide for yourself how risky you think that is.<p>Besides browser specific plugins you should implement a host block. The host block lists are not too exhaustive so if you use dns-crypt configure it to log every dns request and add any new hosts to your block list that look surprising.<p>It’s a lot of work, but if that’s what you’re looking for you may find some fun ways to automate this workflow :)"

"Const does make C go faster, just not in most of the places you see it used.<p>For const to help, the <i>object itself</i> needs to be <i>defined</i> const. Just taking a `const object <i></i>* ` (or `const object&amp;` in C++) doesn&#x27;t help you determine the constness of the underlying object, and that usually accounts for the majority of const usage by volume.<p>Limiting the scope to of actual const <i>definitions</i>, it can help a lot, but only in cases where the compiler couldn&#x27;t move that anyways. So local variable const definitions rarely help, because the compiler can often already prove they are const by inspection (but they can help if the variable escapes).<p>They are useful especially for global variables (and moral equivalents, like static class members in C++), since the compiler cannot prove by examining only the current TU whether the variable is unmodified (and it is a hard problem even if the whole program can be inspected), so const is a useful promise there."

I&#x27;ve never seen a decent LEAD&#x2F;LAG query perform well, and they are too simplistic.

"<i>It’s always better to have multiple sensor modalities available.</i><p>This is the main takeaway. Unsurprising but interesting nonetheless.

But they&#x27;re neglecting very promising approaches that allow to leverage non-annotated datasets (typically standard rgb images) to train models, for example self-supervised learning from video. A great demonstration of the usefulness of self-supervision is monocular depth estimation: taking consecutive frames (2D images) we can estimate per pixel depth and camera ego-motion by training to wrap previous frames into future ones. The result is a model capable of predicting depth on individual 2D frames.

"This sounds like my nightmare operating system. Reusing the same command to operate on very different kinds of objects is a bad idea.
A file is very different from a process. A database table is very different from a file.
Whenever you try to homogenize operations on different kinds of objects under a single operation name, you inevitably lose
flexibility or you have to add a lot of if-then-else statements inside the implementation code which increases cyclomatic complexity and leads to bugs.<p>Also I don&#x27;t think it makes it easier. What if I want to delete a process but I accidentally end up deleting a file because I mistyped the name of the process (or the file has the same name as the process; which one should be deleted?)?
I think we need separate commands because the user needs to be in a different mindset when doing these operations.<p>I&#x27;m actually not a huge fan of the Unix philosophy for that reason; you end up with a lot of general purpose commands which work together in theory and you can
combine them in an infinite number of ways... But in practice, they are too general and this means that combining them becomes too slow for a lot of scenarios...
If commands are too small and too general, you will always end up having to write long sequences of multi-lined commands chained together in order to do anything useful and performance will be bad; you might as well just write C&#x2F;C++ code."
"Did you know that every Opera install on windows and mac using the net-installer gets a uniquely modified exe or zip file with information about the download so that Opera can track where&#x2F;why a browser was downloaded?<p>On windows they modify the PE header of the exe, and adds extra information to a certificate table at the end of the file, without affecting the signature of the file. (Last 4 bytes of the file gives the size of the payload, giving you the offset to start reading a string that starts with OPR followed by a base64 encoded string, which contains a checksum and a json object. The json object contains country of origin, http_referrer of the download, a timestamp, UTM-parameters seen on the referrer, the user agent and a uuid assigned to the download. This uuid is kept for the life time of the browser install.)<p>On mac, the process is a bit different, but there they use appledouble (._-meta files) to modify the zip-file on the fly while downloading including the same type of data."
"&gt; Through the mid-1990s, there was a difference between military-grade encryption and consumer-grade encryption. Laws regulated encryption as a munition and limited what could legally be exported only to key lengths that were easily breakable. That changed with the rise of Internet commerce, because the needs of commercial applications more closely mirrored the needs of the military.<p>The case seems to be that the government and military has almost no special product offerings, so they use consumer tech. Therefore, weakening consumer tech weakens the government and military. This is not a robust argument imo.<p>The stronger argument is about how a whole economy would spring up that would fill office building after office building with full time hackers trying to dox, blackmail, mitm, or steal from every non-banking, non-crypto-approved communication in the world. The interned would eventually just die off as a communications platform as the public completely lost trust in it (though not politicians - they would be approved to use the secure channels and would not understand the issue)<p>edit: typo &amp; wording fix"

"Reading an enumeration of architecture options can be helpful, but I&#x27;ve probably found more value in works like Ousterhout&#x27;s &quot;A Philosophy of Software Design&quot; that cover fundamental design principles. Such principles seem to be applicable no matter the project.<p>I appreciate that Ousterhout tries to support these principles with some data from his own experience (building Tcl, RamCloud where Raft consensus was discovered, etc) and from code reviews of student projects in his design course, but he admits that there is a lack of data about things like design.<p>Sample principles from Ousterhout:<p>* When developing an interface, favor exposing a small number of functions each with deep functionality over exposing a large number of functions each with shallow functionality. For example, favor Unix file I&#x2F;O interface (open, close, read, write, unlink) over Java file I&#x2F;O interface (File, FileReader, BufferedReader, FileWriter, BufferedWriter, FileNotFoundException, ... etc.)<p>* When choosing between keeping your code specific and keeping your code general, favor &quot;somewhat&quot; general. For example, instead of exposing &quot;deleteNextCharacter(text, pos), deleteNextWord(text, pos), deleteNextSentence(text, pos)&quot;, just expose &quot;delete(text, pos, length)&quot; and let the caller use it how they will."

Now, it is show up in time for the warmup, game, leave.<p>This has proven to be the common pattern.  Everything is event driven -- kids go to practice, they leave.  They go to a friend&#x27;s house at a certain time, then leave.  Play dates are scheduled.  There is no just meet outside.<p>We&#x27;ve even ruined adulthood.

"Love it.<p>I remember reading (might have been here) that math and art both get difficult at the same moment for the same reason. When you&#x27;re a kid, you live in the rational world. By this, I mean numbers that can be expressed as the ratio of two integers. Human creations are rational. The volume of a square is a neat, tidy equation. So is the area of a square. You can draw them easily, too, using a ruler and clean nifty lines, and they look great. Squares are all over human creation. You can draw a car with straight lines and squares. Wheels and other things bring in this inconvenient number, pi, that is &quot;irrational&quot;, but let&#x27;s just go with three point blah blah and it&#x27;ll be fine. At least the curvature is constant.<p>So, where are the squares in nature? Hell, where are the circles. Where is the constant curvature. How do you draw a leaf, a tree, a face? How do you calculate the surface volume of a leaf, or the volume of a tree?<p>All of a sudden, you can&#x27;t measure it with the numbers you know. There is no neat ratio of integers that will calculate the volume of that tree trunk. Or even the volume under an easily expressed mathematical equation on a graph. In fact once you start measuring nature, rather than the things people make, rational numbers aren&#x27;t <i>anywhere</i>. All of a sudden, you have to deal with limits, sequences, strange numbers that can be made arbitrarily close to zero as other numbers approach infinity. It turns out <i>every</i> number is &quot;irrational&quot;, pretty much nothing is <i>rational</i>. So, instead of irrational, let&#x27;s call it Real.<p>Where do math and art get hard? When you start to describe things as they are, rather than as we imagine the to be. You know, Real."

"Decentralized Randomness should be pretty easy to do<p>One of the problems with current PKI is weakness in the face of quantum computers, leading to a new crop of algorithms being submitted to NIST, etc.<p>I wanted to ask whether the following simple scheme, based just on cryptographic hashes, can be used CONFIDENTLY, SECURELY and RELIABLY in many situations where Assymetric Key cryptography is used today, and in many others too, such as providing provably random polling etc. It is very similar to a One Time Pad but uses a cryptographic hash function to generate the OTP codes.<p>Here is the scheme:<p>Everyone generates a random private key K[p] and store it just like any assymetric private key (encrypted with some non-stored derived key).<p>They use any cryptographic hash function that hasn’t had a serious preimage attack (perhaps even MD5?), hash it n (eg 10,000,000) times to get h[p][n], and publicly commit to that number. This is like a public key.<p>The hashes are long enough that it’s infeasible to reverse them. Key strengthening can be achieved by jumping a few onion layers between transactions.<p>If you start running out then you post a new public key, signed with one of your remaining onion layer codes.<p>Any verifiers store the original public key per participant, and then can replace them with the new public key if it was properly signed by the old one, etc.<p>Use case: generating provably random numbers by mutually distrusting parties<p>Participants they gradually reveal their hashes, one onion layer per transaction. Each provably random seed is a function of the alphabetically smallest&#x2F;largest three of those hashes at the next onion layer. If not all of them reveal the hashes in time, they gossip, verify and agree on which ones are the smallest&#x2F;largest three before some cutoff point like “most reported that most reported”. That leaves tons of bits of entropy coming from everyone!<p>Use case: Authenticator Apps<p>The hash h[p][n+1] would be a hash of some substring of h[p][n] with enough bits that finding all chosen preimages (by an eavesdropper of the previous code) would be infeasible in advance. Perhaps 10 alphanumeric characters is enough. Also when displaying the code to enter, the authenticator app can tell the user a number from 1-100 indicating to the verifier how many onion layers to peel, making it harder to precompute the preimages. Or the user would have to enter the entire hash via the network-connected computer scanning a QR code, NFC or something. From a security standpoint, this method seems superior to the HOTP and TOTP schemes used in authenticator apps today, since there is no need to trust the verifier with any secret keys (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ietf.org&#x2F;rfc&#x2F;rfc4226.txt"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ietf.org&#x2F;rfc&#x2F;rfc4226.txt</a>) Also there is no need to sychronize clocks, since the client simply lets the server know how many times to run the hash, and increments that number every time.<p>Use case: Signing Payloads<p>Participants reveal a payload and commit to an HMAC signature by using cryptographic key at the next onion level, which at that point would be known only to them. All these signatures are collected into a blockchain block &#x2F; merkle tree timestamp &#x2F; similar thing, and it is sent to the participant before they reveal the onion key they used to sign it.<p>Use case: Off the Record Messaging<p>The Blockchain or Merkle tree is private between a few parties only, so once the next onion level is revealed, no participant can prove the payload was generated by a given participant, since all the onion hashes were known, any of them could generate a new valid tree with any payload history. They can only prove it to each other, or given enough “witnesses” attest to that tree, people might trust then on the basis of consensus of (presumably) mutually distrusting parties, but that’s not the same thing as cryptographic proof. But that is true of any OTR conversation.<p>Use case: Restoring Access<p>This can be used instead of Shamir Secret Key sharing. The server would have to store keys for every participant, and M of N participants would just sign that they approve authorization of some new session, some new key, or whatever. These signatures could be easily checked by anyone who has the public keys of the M participants who signed it.<p>Use case: Decrypting payloads<p>Not sure how one would do this one, to be honest. With PKI, someone could encrypt a payload that can only be decrypted by a private key holder. I see how to do signatures and HMAC, but not the other way."
"This article doesn&#x27;t define what an OS is, so it suffers.<p>The layers that sit directly above the hardware need to be simple and efficient (think like OSI layer 1 and 2).  Actual hardware beneath this needs to be even simpler so it can focus on what good hardware should be: high performance.  For example, having hard drives implement database-like concepts in hardware is bad.  Because then you have to change hardware if your concepts evovle, which is expensive.  So let the hard drive do what it does best, which is get data off of a platter or NAND, and let a layer on the OS abstract that for higher-level layers.<p>The UNIX API is the best we got so far I think, for OSes that are actually useable on a wide variety of hardware platforms.  There&#x27;s a reason why files are byte streams and &quot;type&quot; information is not part of a file - it&#x27;s not a storage device&#x27;s job to do anything but store and retrieve data fast and reliably.  And it&#x27;s not the job of the immediate lower layers of an OS to do anything but facilitate that and interface with a higher layer, like an SQL daemon.<p>The user facing layers high up, like the shell, are technically not OS facilities, they are &quot;default applications&quot; that, in a perfect world, would work under any OS."

"Prompt:<p><i>The jig is up.  And what now? Where do we go from here?</i><p>Completion:<p><i>Where Do We Go From Here: In the aftermath of the fall of the German Republican party, we now have a significant degree of instability across the earth’s systems of government and finance. The almost complete collapse of systemic forces in the Eurozone and limited success at stabilizing the system means the question is not if but when, what do we do next?<p>The answer is simple. We must move beyond the localized, bubble-like, and short-termist “get involved,” tactic of getting into the scene and trying to control it in some way. We have to come up with a way of shifting the socio-political power in the world, the prime place for transformation is worldwide at the supra-system level and not just the economy and finance. We must cast out the old dominated system, of which we have been just a part and recognize that we need a new dominant system that serves human interests, and the meta-level global system must serve human interests.<p>The fact that the global status quo is collapsing of its own weight shows us that the system is structured in such a way that the group of big players who have dominated and still dominate, are in ever-decreasing danger of losing both power and integrity.<p>The question now is, how? How do we avoid degeneration into chaos and conflict when the anarchic nature of the system leads inevitably to greater and greater competition among and frustration and anger in the younger generations?<p>This is a society, this is a planet and we live in the first global century of human history, which the young will pass from generation to generation in the next twenty years, or perhaps not. When we see the events of the last weeks and days, you can just imagine what will happen to this planet, to this planet and human society in the century ahead, and you can just imagine what the future will bring to this and subsequent generations.<p>When history describes the past, it sees the collapse of an old political establishment, of the traditional hierarchies of power, of society, of economics and finance. It sees a collapse in the old order of power and in the equilibrium it has created, which was grounded in constant growing jobs and the prosperity it produced. We are in the middle of a permanent expansion of capitalism, which also creates ever-growing wealth and prosperity for a small population of wealthy earners, while social polarization and inequality increase and older people depend on each other more and more desperately.<p>The forward and downward momentum of all these forces has created a situation in which there is almost no limit to the volume of the day to day, or minute to minute production and consumption, and in which there is no single concern about the future of the planet Earth. We have become so insatiable, in need, addicted to this ever increasing appetite for consumer goods, that we destroy the planet with it.<p>You see this just from what we feed our children, the choices we make, and the products we consume. You see it in our greedy attempts to buy as much as we can, even if it leads to ecological ruin. You see it in our drive to consume new and ever more lavish luxury products, materials, tools, devices, insatiable lifestyles, modern-day imperialism, racism, cynicism, competition, greed, consumerism, hubris, and endless pursuit of personal ambitions and leisure.<p>See how when push comes to shove, the social and economic growth created by the continued expansion of capitalism is now a life or death matter. See how the political establishment has failed us, all of us, and how we turned in desperation to another self-serving-self-protective-petty, self-interested-philistine mass-mediator, in the form of Mr. Romney, in order to maintain the old sources of power, to make the old social structures fit to serve human needs and the system could be kept going.<p>And now he has packed his bags and wants to leave, so there we are, stuck here with those of us who have found a way to provide for ourselves and live peacefully and prosperously, without the brutality and violence visited on us by politicians and corrupted systems. That is, unless we fix these broken systems and deliver an alternative based on human needs and human compassion.<p>How do we do it? How do we get there?

"About 7 years ago, when I was trying to monitor .Net apps, there weren&#x27;t that many alternatives available.

Have been listening to his podcast for ages. If you are interested in meditation, from a non-religion perspective I would definitely recommend it. I&#x27;m still having a tough time understanding what all this no-self and no-ego is about. That will just take some time I guess.<p>For me personally I&#x27;ve been mixing meditation and stoisism a bit to find some peace and acceptance for my very critical self image. But it&#x27;s hard to find good stoic teaching, most of it just seems written by sleazy marketeers.<p>Last thing I would recommend for anyone interested in meditation, starting with tools like headspace a good way to get into the habit. But to be honest, I&#x27;m having a hard time still getting value out of their teachings. I went from<p>headspace &gt; just settings a timer with the Oak app for 20-30 min &gt; back to headspace.<p>I feel if made less progress then the simple timer. of course I&#x27;m not 100% sure if it the headspace app, or me just simply plateauing but my I think I&#x27;m going to go back to a simple timer. The headspace app is just so damn noisy."
"I also switched from macOS to Linux and am happy. I wrote a blog post titled &quot;Home and Hotel&quot; about this once [1].

"The author seems to not know the difference between the chip and the ISA - Instruction Set Architecture. How this is implemented in silicon (or other substrate) does not seem to have been released, so you&#x27;d have to create your own cores, cache, memory interface and all that jazz. It <i>does</i> mean that RISC-V chips could be used as a starting point, because they already implement all that, but with a different ISA. However, it&#x27;s probably non-trivial to implement a different ISA on an existing chip design. AMD did it with their early Athlon chips, by using a translation layer, but that&#x27;s not the most efficient way to do it..."

"This article disproves itself. The two chief errors are as follows:<p>1) The article incorrectly discounts the value of time saved by avoiding congestion. The study the article cites actually estimates $7&#x2F;hour for time saved on a commute, plus a whopping $22&#x2F;hour for increasing reliability on a commute: <a href=""http:&#x2F;&#x2F;faculty.bus.lsu.edu&#x2F;papers&#x2F;pap16_07.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;faculty.bus.lsu.edu&#x2F;papers&#x2F;pap16_07.pdf</a>. Both figures are critically important.<p>As to time savings, transit commutes are significantly longer: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.geotab.com&#x2F;time-to-commute"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.geotab.com&#x2F;time-to-commute</a>. 30% of public transit commutes in NYC are over 1 hour, compared to just 10% of car commutes. 28% of car commutes are under 30 minutes, versus just 6% of transit commutes. In Dallas, a place without the geographic constraints of NYC, 57% of car commutes are under 30 minutes. People in Dallas are accruing tremendous time value savings by driving as compared to people taking transit in NYC.<p>As to reliability--while in theory transit should be highly reliable, in practice it isn&#x27;t. In DC, rail on-time performance is just 87%, meaning you&#x27;ll be late once a week on average. NYC&#x27;s performance is worse--it recently just broke 80% on-time performance: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.metro-magazine.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;photos&#x2F;734837&#x2F;nyc-subway-on-time-performance-passes-80-for-first-time-in-6-years&#x2F;74646"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.metro-magazine.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;photos&#x2F;734837&#x2F;nyc-subway...</a>.<p>All this has a practical ramification. The US has some of the fastest commutes in the OECD: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.oecd.org&#x2F;els&#x2F;family&#x2F;LMF2_6_Time_spent_travelling_to_and_from_work.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.oecd.org&#x2F;els&#x2F;family&#x2F;LMF2_6_Time_spent_travelling...</a>. 48 minutes per day for the US, versus 101 for heavily transit-dependent Korea.<p>2) The article acknowledges that from 1982 to present, we have been able to increase vehicle miles traveled per day by 60% without significantly increasing daily commutes. The article illogically assumes that there is no value to that increased mobility. But if there wasn&#x27;t nobody would do it. People do it because they would rather have a bigger, newer house, in a place with better schools, than a shorter commute. The article not only fails to quantify the value of those additional amenities, it refuses to acknowledge they even exist."

"My somewhat off-beat recommendation is &quot;Lions&#x27; Commentary on UNIX 6th Edition with Source Code&quot;. The sources to a 1976 version of Unix written in an archaic dialect of C and targeting a long-dead CPU architecture are obviously not of immediate relevance to the modern world, and may well not be to your taste unless you already have some sympathy with the idea of retrocomputing. But if you do: 6th Edition is small enough that you really can read through the whole set of sources and understand pretty much how the whole thing is put together; the basic bones of the design are not so far away from Linux, so it gives you a workable conceptual model of what the shape of the Linux sources are and what the various important parts are; the commentary is really good, explaining the inscrutable but nudging you to figure things out yourself too; and overall it is practice in reading a large volume of somebody else&#x27;s code, which is something you&#x27;re going to be doing all the time if you work on Linux or any modern kernel. You probably also want a more theoretical and general book too, of course."
"Here are my high level thoughts after a quick look at the question and some clarification in thread below.<p>- a single question is difficult to evaluate. &quot;Answering a business question&quot; is at the very end, usually, of a bunch of exploratory steps<p>- 60 min is reasonable but not much time to evaluate real work.  You either need to expand the time (also a problem, for interviewing) or allow scoring of &quot;what I&#x27;d do next&quot;<p>- tooling familiarity is going to be a huge factor with short time. Are you testing general knowledge or environment knowledge?<p>- too focused on models, too &quot;kaggle-like&quot;. That covers about 20% of the skills and job.<p>Here are the sorts of things I look for. Do they understand:<p>1. How to verify &amp; validate data, clean inputs, handle coding errors and ELT type issues<p>2. How to evaluate data set issues like bias, missing data and outliers, and account for that (and when you can&#x27;t)<p>3. (situational) How their infrastructure works an what they need it to do (e.g. for distributed training, if appropriate). How to use it effectively.<p>4. How to control data and code throughout lifecycle, so you don&#x27;t waste time and experiments<p>5. How to choose between approaches and models<p>6. How to evaluate  performance rigorously<p>7. How to monitor performance over time<p>but here is the kicker<p>8. How do you know you are trying to solve the right problem?<p>For junior people, the emphasis will be on the earlier points.  For senior people the last point is key.<p>Your question partially addresses some of the early points only.<p>Off the top of my head suggestions.<p>- Have separate stages.  Cleanup &amp; verification can have objective and subjective issues (missing &amp; corrupt data?  Outliers?)<p>-  Don&#x27;t focus too much on modeling, it&#x27;s the least interesting part.<p>-  Allow different toolsets possibly (e.g. R)<p>-  Initial cleanup&#x2F;eval stage on a CSV, but following stage pull from SQL?<p>-  Possibly allow multiple inference choices from same or a few data sets.  Give a short list of things the &quot;business&quot; is interested in, they pick and describe why<p>- good idea to focus a bit on producing one&#x2F;two graphics&#x2F;tables to communicate to a lay audience.<p>- more focus on verification<p>- add a validation discussion requirement.  How are you going to know what you did is worth doing?<p>- add a &quot;next things I would try&#x2F;do&quot;<p>The latter is going to be text heavy but no way to avoid this unless there is a follow on voice&#x2F;personal interview.<p>There isn&#x27;t any way you are going to auto score this stuff reliably, so that&#x27;s probably ok.

"We need to write a lot of small APIs in Python for SPAs. We ended up going with FastAPI which utilizes Starlette under the hood. I&#x27;m surprised neither of them are mentioned here.<p>Starlette was developed by the same dev who wrote the Django RESTful package. If you mostly just need REST APIs or even GraphQL, it feels far more light and modern than anything in Django and forms some better opinions around things than the usual roll your own stack in flask alternative. Not to mention it&#x27;s ASGI based instead of WSGI and naturally faster because of it.<p>FastAPI just builds on that by adding some nice features like minimal dependency injection and really awesome integration with type hints via Pydantic."

"In general the ancient Romans were more interested in mathematical application, instead of abstraction. I think that&#x27;s true for many other ancient civilizations as well. It&#x27;s not true that the Romans didn&#x27;t understand mathematics, they were spectacular engineers. They just focused on something different.<p>The Romans invented Roman numerals, and it&#x27;s important to acknowledge that this was a mathematical achievement even though we don&#x27;t use them as much any more. By putting smaller numbers in front of larger ones, they created a number writing system where you did not have to learn a large number of symbols yet any particular number was short and easy to write. Greek numbers had separate symbols not only for one through nine, but for each of the symbols 10 through 90, which meant you had to learn a lot more symbols for just one through 99.<p>It&#x27;s true that doing calculations with Roman numerals is a pain, especially division, but I don&#x27;t think the Romans thought this was a big deal. Calculations were typically done using an abacus anyway, so you simply needed a simple way to record results."

Although aftermarket parts have come a long way. We now stock iPhone batteries that have larger capacity than the original. (Yes, truly a larger capacity. We do 30,000+ repairs a year...we are not messing around with batteries that just say they have a larger capacity.)<p>The biggest problem I potentially see is profit margins. AASP&#x27;s have long struggled because Apple wants to squeeze all of the profit out of their business. If you pay $149 to get your iPhone 8 screen replaced, but Apple charges us $135 for the screen, we can&#x27;t realistically make any money off of that.<p>We charge $69 to replace an iPhone 8 screen currently, so there&#x27;s also a potential negative on the consumer side of having to pay more to get screens replaced. It does, however, appear that Apple will let providers in this program also offer third-party screens, which is a big change from the current AASP program.<p>All in all, as someone whose business is directly affected by this, I&#x27;m mildly optimistic. As long as Apple understands that repair shops need to be profitable too, this can be a really good thing for both sides."

AMD was basically forced into more cores earlier because of weakness in single thread.  Today, the software _is_ there (well, mostly) and we can all take advantage of more cores.<p>- Why did Intel fall behind?  Easy: Brian Krzanich&#x27;s hubris pushed the process too hard, taking many risks, and the strategy failed spectacularly.<p>- PCIe Gen4 does matter.  M.2 NVMe has been read limited for a long time already (NAND bandwidth scales trivially). The I&#x2F;O section of this article is basically nonsense.<p>- There&#x27;s is nothing magical about x86, nor about the AMD and Intel design team.

"Irrational has two meanings:<p>“Not logical”, which by definition does not apply to math.<p>“Not a ratio”, e.g., a number that cannot be written as the division (ratio) of two whole numbers.<p>It should be no surprise to anyone, that calculus deals with the latter, but the title would allude to the article dealing with the former."

"The last sentence of the video is “google wave, because... because... fuck you <i>exasperated sigh</i>”.<p>I burst out laughing at that and I’ve been trying to figure out why.<p>Laughter is an act of destruction, an emotional declaration that this thing is not part of reality and wiping it out of existence.<p>A lot of what tech companies do feels like a fuck you. Killing Google Reader without explanation, disabling the full capabilities of ad blockers, removing headphone jacks, letting third parties exploit our social data, hiding the full scope of data collection behind a vague “we will use your data to improve the service”, and so much more.<p>The relationship between tech companies and customers wasn’t nearly so adversarial 20-30 years ago. In the 1980s, it felt like Microsoft was really on a mission to bring computers to everyone. Sony was creating tech to allow us to listen to our existing music collections. By the late 90s, Apple’s big idea was basically “candy color are pretty, they will make our users happy, so let’s make good colorful cases”.<p>And up to the mid 00s, google really seemed like a champion and advocate for internet users. It felt like (though in hindsight it was an illusion) that when policy decisions were being made, we could trust Google to be our voice when we weren’t in the room.<p>“Because fuck you” would not have been at all funny back then."
"I&#x27;ve semi-seriously been considering starting my own OS project to circumvent some of the IO latency issues with VR and AR applications.<p>The big metric is motion-to-photon latency, which is a measure (in milliseconds) of how quickly a user&#x27;s head motion is reflected on the display. Anything greater than ~10ms is considered insufficient, as you&#x27;ve missed a whole frame of rendering for VR headsets that run at 90hz refresh rate.<p>Current XR applications need to wait for the USB or Bluetooth stack to return the head pose before modifying the view, then wait for the graphics stack to reflect that change. There are many ring transitions along the way. This leads to an absolute minimum motion-to-photon latency that can&#x27;t be broken just because of OS overhead. This eats into your frame budget, as every ms of context-switching out of the IO drivers leaves you fewer ms to render a frame in time to get it back into the kernel for context-switching back to the graphics driver."
Honest question: what is AV even for these days? I have had some form of AV on all of my Windows machines since the 90&#x27;s. I don&#x27;t think I have seen a detection in at least ten years.

"Pretty funny to see Simpson&#x27;s name showing up here. I have kept two souvenirs from my academic life: the original manuscript of my thesis and Simpson&#x27;s very eloquent and overwhelmingly positive review of it.<p>Regarding the topic, I&#x27;d say that mathematics, as a whole, is a set of intuitions and ideas, rather than strict proofs. I&#x27;ve spent a fair amount of time working my way through some of Kontsevich&#x27;s ideas and attended many of his talks -- he rarely (if ever) gives any proofs, my educated guess is that he proposes some extremely profound ideas and his collaborators grind through the details (not always). And it still works just fine.<p>I remember Kenji Fukaya saying once, talking about a PDE-heavy theorem: &quot;We are trying to keep the details of the proof under 500 pages and it&#x27;s not sa easy&quot;. The main issue here is that people who don&#x27;t do professional, academic research in mathematics are unaware of the complexity of modern maths. It has evolved immensely during last 50 years, the theories are just layers and layers of foundational work one has to assimilate before getting any work done. Rigorous verification takes years and no one in the academia is being offered a job for proof-reading of existing papers.<p>One should also remember that referees of the papers are not being paid, it&#x27;s considered &quot;work for the community&quot; and it&#x27;s hard to blame them for not reading the papers in detail.<p>Mathematics are anti-fragile."
"I live in the southwestern USA, and have no air conditioning. I do have a solid brick house that is an awesome insulator. So we open up all windows and doors at night, and close the house up tight when the sun rises, putting heavy curtains over the windows.

"&gt;Keep in mind that each payment made through the Starbucks app is a payment that isn&#x27;t made by credit card.

It showed three things: they were not in control, if they were the usage would have be stopped. Everyone out there needed to see t%his. Two, it made it unpleasant for them to be in the headspace, which has obvious advantages. Three, it pointed out impersonators of BS because they would not call each other f@%%ot, thus helping to mitigate the spread of false information. Apologies for those unintentionally offended.

"I’m surprised HN is so hostile toward IT architecture. I work in the public sector in Denmark, and enterprise architecture is vital for us. We’re 98 municipalities that each operate around 300 different IT systems. These need to interact with each other, as well as major IT systems on the regional and state level (citizen base data, healthcare, taxes and so on). They’re build&#x2F;maintained by 50 major vendors and a few thousand small ones. Sometimes a system changes hands through public procurement. The longest running systems are from the 70ies, and have several layers of modern APIs build on top of each other.<p>Imagine doing all that by letting thousands of random developers run completely free. I mean, I don’t have to imagine because we didn’t actually involve architects early enough, and it’s cost us billions to correct that mistake."

Everyone out there needed to see t%his. Two, it made it unpleasant for them to be in the headspace, which has obvious advantages. Three, it pointed out impersonators of BS because they would not call each other f@%%ot, thus helping to mitigate the spread of false information.

"Several years ago I went on a hike&#x2F;hammock camping trip.  This was in an `old-growth` state forest and had practically no underbrush.  The ground around the campfire area was bare dirt, and I sat&#x2F;reclined on a ground-sheet and a &#x27;sit-pad&#x27;.  (two layers between me &amp; the ground).<p>2-days into the camping I started to feel like I was having a reaction to a bug bite, assumed it was mosquitoes and ignored it.<p>I got home after 4-days, went to climb in the shower and my wife pointed out that I had several ticks attached to my back.  So I grabbed my knife, pulled them off, and watched the area for a few days.  (I had my wife circle the red-welts with a sharpie to make sure it didn&#x27;t spread.)<p>I was ofcourse concerned about Lyme.  Turns out nothing happened, and the redness went down.  But I took precautions against getting made a meal of, and I still failed.  It was a sobering incident, and I know I was lucky."

"Quote: <i>It wasn’t even that slow. Something like a quarter-second lag when you opened a dropdown or clicked a button.

Like everything in IT, it depends.<p>A high-volume app definitely needs attention to response and performance because employees will be wasting tons of hours if it&#x27;s not. That&#x27;s why primary applications should probably be desktop client-server applications, where it&#x27;s easier to control the UI. But that&#x27;s typically only roughly 1&#x2F;4 of all apps used by an org.<p>Something used only occasionally, such as for customers with special conditions, a somewhat sluggish web app is probably fine. If it&#x27;s easy to make it snappy, great, but not everything is, due to our annoying web (non) standards[1]. If it takes 100 hours of programming  to reduce 50 hours of UI waits over say a 10 year period, then the org doesn&#x27;t benefit. 10 years is a good default rule of thumb duration for software lifetime. Your org may vary. Remember to include program maintenance, not just initial coding.<p>In short, use the right tool for the job, and do some analysis math before starting.<p>[1] My &quot;favorite&quot; rant is that web-standards suck for typical work-oriented productivity applications, and need a big overhaul or supplement. Nobody wants to solve this."

"I&#x27;ve been thinking about this problem recently. I drive a 2010 and can handily afford a new vehicle, so I&#x27;ve been somewhat attuned to the good and bad features of new vehicles. 10 years is a <i>long</i> time in the auto industry, especially when it comes to cars and their interior tech. Having watched my friends with newer cars struggle to get them to work properly has really put me off shopping for a new one, since these systems generally aren&#x27;t optional anymore - there&#x27;s no longer a &#x27;base model&#x27; with a plain stereo and dash items.<p>Anyway, because of this I&#x27;ve been keeping my eyes out for cars that are still in new production today, but are using an old design. These are, in my opinion, better because their systems date from before a time where problems like those mentioned in the OP didn&#x27;t exist, yet the car is brand new. There&#x27;s not many out there, any it seems limited to low volume - read: pricey - models. One example is the Nissan 370z."

"&gt; In 1859 the US Secretary of War, Jefferson Davis, strongly favored the southerly railroad route from New Orleans to San Diego: it was shorter, had no major mountains to traverse, and had lower operational costs due to lack of snowfall to clear from the tracks. However, in the 1850s no Congressman from a northern state would have voted for a southerly railroad route to aid the Confederacy&#x27;s slave-based economy, and no Congressman from the south would have voted for a northerly route.<p>I feel like this overlooks the other main reason to prefer a northern route - the north was where most of the people and industry were. The midwest and northeast were much denser than the southeast, and it was important for railroads to serve industrial hubs like St. Louis and Chicago, which had onward connections to the northeast. A San Diego-New Orleans Route is &quot;shorter&quot; only if you overlook the extra 850+ miles to get from New Orleans to Chicago, plus the additional travel within California (probably by ship). There are good reasons to prefer the northern alignment that was chosen, and Jefferson Davis&#x27; motivation was just as political as the northern Congressmen who opposed the southern alignment."

"I gotta say, it’s great that someone is making this attempt, however it turns out. PNG has been in a uniquely bad position re: “monoculture”, with libpng being not just the “reference implementation”, but the <i>only</i> implementation anyone bothers to use.<p>But libpng was intended as <i>only</i> a reference implementation—a rigid adherent to the PNG standard, for the sake of having a “runnable version” of the PNG standard—and was never particularly optimized for production use-cases, or code readability&#x2F;maintainability&#x2F;low attack surface, or any other criteria you might like to have. Libpng is optimized for one thing only: allowing other PNG implementations to build spec-compatibility test suites by testing against libpng behaviour.<p>Because of this rigid adherence, libpng doesn’t implement—and will never implement—any features that <i>aren’t</i> in the base PNG spec, like APNG.<p>And since everyone <i>uses</i> libpng as their PNG implementation (for <i>some</i> reason), nobody ends up adopting these extra features. (Sure, all the major browsers except Edge support APNG, but does your image editor? Does your IoT thermostat whose OS uses PNG image assets? Does your game console? Nah. Because these all just compile in libpng. And <i>this</i> is what kills support for features like APNG in the crib.)<p>That was never the PNG Working Group’s intent, of course. They don’t want to restrict the development of extra PNG features (yes, even though they developed MNG and might see features like APNG as “competing” with MNG, they don’t really care.) They keep libpng the way it is, not for ideological reasons, but simply because they don’t care about doing anything with libpng that moves it away from “reference implementation of the base PNG spec” territory. (And why would they? Their job as the PNG Working Group is to produce the PNG base spec. It’s supposed to be everyone <i>else’s</i> job, in the ecosystem, to produce conformant implementations. They even gave you libpng to make that easier!)<p>So, like I said, I’m glad someone is finally writing an alternative implementation (in C), such that the projects that currently use libpng could reasonably choose to switch to libspng. It’s the same feeling I get from seeing LibreSSL and BoringSSL: that an ecosystem that was essentially “dead” and stuck in a set of bad choices due to everyone sticking with one unchanging reference impl, is now coming alive again."

"I am learning drawing. A lot of people who are beginners to drawing experience a block where they struggle to put on the first line on paper, or when they do it they are not satisfied and erase it and start again. You end up not doing anything. That&#x27;s why in beginner&#x27;s classes you often get exercises to help you overcome that. Such as covering the whole page with scribbles first and drawing on that. Or timed exercises where you have to finish your drawing in five minutes or a minute or less. The point is to get one accustomed to doing things and doing them again and to realise the first attempt is often not as good as you want and can. 
I think digital tools make this kind of block even harder because it&#x27;s so easy to draw something, undo and try again, and the fact you&#x27;re not wasting film frames, paper or paint makes it harder to get things done? This is certainly my experience with writing.

"I&#x27;m from the bay area and moved to Vietnam 3 years ago. I&#x27;m watching all of this happen in realtime. I&#x27;ve recently completed a 8500km motorbike trip around all of Vietnam, southern Cambodia and Northern Laos.<p>In the south of Vietnam, HCMC, there is massive growth. Huge amounts of construction. The city is over populated and growing rapidly. Millions of kids work for $200 a month.<p>In the north of Vietnam, there is many illegal roads being cut through the forests and jungles to ship things from China. I&#x27;ve ridden these same dirt roads on a motorbike and seen the trucks. Did you know that Vietnam is also building a wall between themselves and China?<p>All over Vietnam, people are making babies in huge numbers. There is a lot of family pressure to do so. They may only have 100m people now, but every single shack and house has 2-3 babies in it. It will be very interesting to see what happens to all these humans over the next 20 years as this country grows at a rapid pace.<p>Cities in the north like Hai Phong are expanding rapidly. It is a massive port city that does trade with China and elsewhere. There is a road leading to the airport where all the super wealthy old vietnamese guys spend their &#x27;retired&#x27; days riding their bicycles. Anyone who thinks Vietnam is poor should see the absurd size of the mansions here. This is where Samsung has their factories. A massive car factory (Vinfast) was recently built here as well.<p>In Cambodia and Laos, the Chinese are building a trade route directly through the two countries. Literally cutting a huge freeway and railroad from north to south. Buying up all the land and stripping it. Zero concern for the environment. Even cutting holes through mountains. In return, China Power is also building hydro dams, which are causing lakes to dry up and rivers to flood in the wet season. Google &#x27;china Sihanouk&#x27; to see what&#x27;s happening there. My guess is that if you look on a map, this will give China a great water route directly to Africa.

"&gt; In the US, it&#x27;s cheaper to build and operate wind farms than buy fossil fuels.<p>This is currently HN&#x27;s title, and the article&#x27;s subtitle. But the article makes no statement to prove this assertion.<p>It does not even make sense to me. I guess the author meant that for firms that have high energy needs. But it is stupid to imply that the electricity provided by fossil fuel can always be replaced by wind turbines. If the need is for regular bursts, high volumes on short periods, wind won&#x27;t be of much use.<p>Moreover, the article is a digest of a report that is less emphatic. The US Department of Energy expects a slow-down of wind capacity after 2020, once the tax credit will end. For a project that would start now, there would be no tax credit, so it would be hard to reach a competitive price."

I&#x27;m surprised this blog post made the first page of HN given its lack of sources or analysis.<p>Maybe a good discussion can come on one example startup advice from YC: do things that don&#x27;t scale.<p>I think this is really sound in that they&#x27;re saying &quot;get product-market-fit with some segment of users.&quot; i.e. know that there&#x27;s demand for your product&#x2F;service even if it&#x27;s pretty manual to deliver early on. Then see how to automate. Because most product&#x2F;services aren&#x27;t materially better than existing options and so you never get product-market-fit even when it&#x27;s entirely manual and customized to the user.<p>As a founder I&#x27;ve been guilty of building first because it&#x27;s fun. I saw what I wanted in user research and built a whole app accordingly. It failed.

The interesting thing is I knew of the advice &quot;do things that don&#x27;t scale&quot; beforehand.

"Going to try to respond to this in good faith. I know there is some intrinsic bias what with Google being an ad company, but I&#x27;ll try to ignore that and assume they wish to protect users within Chrome, advertising division be damned.<p>On point one, regardless of cookie blocking or not, these more aggressive means of tracking users are going to happen. If they (ad programs) can eke out extra data points on users, that&#x27;s more value that translates into revenue for them so of course they&#x27;re going to do it. They&#x27;re saying they&#x27;re going to do what they can to mitigate fingerprinting, face value, that&#x27;s great, but it&#x27;s like anything: a game of cat and mouse where when one opportunity closes, they&#x27;ll chase another.<p>Point two is going to be a hard sell.

I don&#x27;t disagree that advertisers are a necessary evil on the Internet (sites want to make money, we&#x27;re usually not paying them, so forth and so on), but at the same time, some networks are historically bad for user experience: not in a &quot;ah man, that banner ad is annoying&quot; way, but in a &quot;it just hijacked the page and now I&#x27;m trying to do a bunch of stuff to get back to the content&#x2F;away from the site&quot; way."

Very nice visualizations.

"I&#x27;m can&#x27;t dispute that fast software is a desirable trait for users.  I would love to spec low latencies into the requirements documents for my GUI projects.  But from a business standpoint, UI latency requirements are a good way to sabotage a project.<p>Slow solutions have a dramatic business advantage: using libraries, you can shave months off your delivery schedule by adding miliseconds to your UI delays.   The months add up; so do the miliseconds.  By using someone else&#x27;s crufty libraries, you can write a calculator app over the weekend.  Libraries will handle the double buffering for screen painting, unpacking fonts and rendering them into bitmaps, how to reflow text onto a screen, etc.  It might take seconds for the app to load all it&#x27;s assets and display the first user activity, but it was cheap to create, easy to iterate, and it gets the job done.  These are hallmarks of a valuable startup engineering effort.<p>But the development process for speedy applications is anathema to businesses of any size.  You have to throw away Electron and hire systems engineers with knowledge of the entire platform.  After some profiling, they may determine that the required speed is only possible once the system event handler has been replaced with a pared down routine, or when the framework&#x27;s audio interface is bypassed so the sound card can be accessed through low-latency DMA mode.  You have to repeat this for every platform you intend to support.  You have to throw away the wheel that everyone else is using and pay to reinvent one that spins a little faster.<p>To paraphrase Joel Spolsky&#x27;s comment on rewriting software: are you sure you want to give that kind of a gift to your competitor?  For most companies it isn&#x27;t worth it.<p>Are there exceptions?  Yes: a motivated engineer like John Carmack may work months to eliminate another 3ms frame latency out of a VR headset simply because of personal passion.  Google can amortize additional billions by wringing 100ms out of page load times by funding a browser project so complex that you also have to design a new build system for it.  But if you&#x27;re not Carmack and you&#x27;re not Google, you probably can&#x27;t afford to reinvent the wheel."

"These are quite silly things. Firstly, why invent words instead of just using the ltters. Obviously A creates an ambiguity with &quot;eight&quot;, but other than that, things are fine. Perhaps A should be &quot;aye&quot;.<p>The &quot;teen&quot; suffix is wrong; it specifically means &quot;ten&quot;. For instance thirteen means three+ten, so it is inappropriate to pronounce 0x13 as &quot;thirteen&quot;. So that is to say, the pronunciation issue does not begin at 1A; we shouldn&#x27;t call 0x19 &quot;nineteen&quot;, but something else.<p>Similarly 0x30 shouldn&#x27;t be &quot;thirty&quot; because that word means three times ten.<p>There shouldn&#x27;t be any common words between hex pronunciation and decimal that denote a different integer.

"Working in the area makes this text on Tensil’s page me extremely curious: “This gives you the performance of custom silicon at the cost of commodity hardware.

"I&#x27;m going to go meta with my comment and say that this article is a fantastic object lesson as to why linux faces extremely low odds of ever being adapted as a widespread replacement for windows or OS X. How many people (outside of your coworkers) do you know who would or could follow a path similar to the one laid out in this article?<p>I&#x27;m speaking as someone who has dabbled with linux since 1998. At that time, and now, there is a huge, confused ball of conflict between linux distributions, various levels of customization to those distributions, and documentation available on the web.<p>Here&#x27;s a quick, recent example from my own experience. I decided I wanted to learn more about Emacs. I work in Windows at work, so I downloaded portacle. Great. Works great. Then you start watching youtube videos on how to customize Emacs, but most youtube videos are using Emacs in Linux. So you then have to find where portacle puts all the stuff that is in a completely different place than all the Emacs documentation and videos say it is. Great. And I haven&#x27;t found anyone who talks about the benefits&#x2F;costs and gotchas about whether to edit the init.el file, or the .emacs file, but now we&#x27;re getting into the weeds.<p>So after that frustrating rabbit hole, I think, &quot;I&#x27;ll just install a linux distro in a VM.&quot; Next thought: &quot;Which distro should I get?&quot; Search engines are no help when it comes to finding the &quot;best&quot; linux distro because all I can find is superficial opinion pieces on the matter.<p>So back when I worked at an ISP in the early 00s, they used Debian, so I download Debian.<p>Try to install emacs in Debian, and I start getting weird errors about some certain package not being current enough, and apparently someone isn&#x27;t maintaining&#x2F;updating the install script for Debian. That&#x27;s three days lost getting to that conclusion.<p>So I wipe that VM and download Ubuntu, because it seems to be the most widely used distro, and seems like a good distro for &quot;normies&quot; like me. Install emacs, no problem. Can customize by following youtube videos, no problem. Enjoying emacs now.<p>All of this comes at a high price, however. I&#x27;ve been messing around with trying to use emacs for a few months now, on my side time at work and at home, and it&#x27;s only been in the last couple of weeks that I&#x27;ve been able to use the package in a way in line with the available training materials.<p>Normies have no kind of patience for this kind of ridiculousness. Techies justify these &quot;rabbit holes&quot; as enthralling and fun, and yeah, it feels good to finally figure some of this kind of stuff out, but overall, it&#x27;s a massive distraction from actually USING the tools, rather than just futzing around, trying to get the damn tools to work in the first place."

"my session:<p>so i&#x27;ve been trying to use this dangerous writing application for like 10 minutes now and it&#x27;s been a valuable source of inspiration and a little bit of stress as well. i know that if i stop writing the whole text will be lost and because of that, i am constantly forced to keep writing whatever comes to my mind, and since nothing is coming to my mind right now, i am writing about this very same writing process that is unfolding as i go. i have just stalled a bit and the text started to blur which startled me a little bit and i found the red+blurry effect quite amusing. i believe they have used the red color because it usually means danger&#x2F;blood stuff for us human beings. i can write very slowly and it doesn&#x27;t blur, so it&#x27;s not linked to typing speed. you just need to be consistent and don&#x27;t stop for too much.<p>i believe this kind of tool is amusing but i am a little worried about what kind of usage would i get from this in a coding endeavour like developing a system or something. i surely have to stop for several minutes at a time to think about solutions or designs for my code and having it wipe out everything if i stall surely sounds counterproductive, altough i wouldn&#x27;t know until i actually tried. maybe if the code was wiped out the design would still be in my head and i&#x27;d be able to write it down again in a more concise (and revised) manner, potentially improving my structure and forcing me to rethink about everytime it gets wiped out... so yeah, there is a big chance this might even surprise me as a tool to be used in a coding environment. still, the idea sounds really silly, specially when you consider huge files. maybe it could wipe out since your last git commit"

"One of the developers here! Right now, we compare answers visually, so for example `n \choose k` and `\binom{n}{k}` will both be accepted. However, sometimes there are things that look similar to the human eye, but are rendered slightly differently -- this is usually due to alignment, spacing, or size. For example, `\not\in` (bad) vs `\notin` (good) is a pretty annoying example. Making the comparison &#x2F; feedback mechanism better is a tough problem. It isn&#x27;t as simple as increasing the pixel threshold: replacing a + with a - has an extremely small pixel difference (and the two characters have the same width, so it doesn&#x27;t affect anything else), but we shouldn&#x27;t accept both.<p>Right now, the website is a super simple static HTML page. If we have time, we&#x27;d also like to add some new features, like a leaderboard and (hopefully) better comparison logic. Feel free to contribute, and we appreciate the feedback!"
The coolest part is that it&#x27;s in F#. Add that to the title. How many F# samples do we get around here anymore?
"Chiplets is what gives AMD an absolutely brutal advantage. Their high end chips do not need expensive large dies -- just a few small ones. Yields are much better. And they can bin each chiplet separately. Oh and they don&#x27;t spend the expensive top notch process on the I&#x2F;O part of the CPU either. Intel might be hard pressed to catch up to this -- sure the 7nm EUV process in two years and a bit will very likely be a serious jump in IPC but if you are comparing similarly priced server CPUs then even that is very likely to be simply not enough due to this chiplet strategy. For the foreseeable future, inertia alone is the only reason for anyone to buy an Intel server chip."

I can&#x27;t recommend The Man Who Stole Portugal by Murray Teigh Bloom enough. I loved this book.<p>The most curious aspect about all this is that he seems to have had a positive influence on the Portuguese economy. It was a sort of QE. The subsequent regime locked the Portuguese economy back into its ossified ways.

"The core problem is deserialization formats where the serialized content specifies that class that should be instantiated. See the yaml, pickle, Java, etc serialization bugs over the years.<p>The real kicker here is that someone was clearly <i>trying</i> to do the correct thing (see mentions of secure coding), but the way secure coding works meant that arbitrary subclasses of any type that declared itself as supporting secure coding could be instantiated. Because the subclasses don&#x27;t necessarily actually support secure coding you get much sadness.<p>There are things that could be done to make deserialization safer, but the core problem will remain that the untrusted content gets to specify the classes that will be instantiated."

"Good read, but there is a huge elephant in the room.<p>In many cases vulnerabilities come from complex, messy, disorganized, or just poorly written code. Assuming that the &quot;fuzzification&quot; techniques are implemented by the same developer who wrote the original vulnerable code; how can we be sure that he isn&#x27;t introducing <i>MORE</i> bugs in his fuzzified version?<p>For example, if you have a product which is <i>NOT</i> currently vulnerable and add BranchTrap to it the likelihood that you&#x27;re creating a vulnerability where one never existed before is insanely high.<p>So you essentially created a code path for the fuzzer that never would have existed if you never tried to fool the fuzzer in the first place.<p>Assuming two binaries, an original and a &quot;fuzzified&quot; version and an unlimited amount of time: Which version would have overall <i>More</i> vulnerable code paths? Probably the fuzzified version simply because it has more code. The point of producing two binaries is that one can be analyzed quickly and one slowly. But if your original code doesn&#x27;t contain a vulnerability and the fuzzed version does your trusted party doesn&#x27;t mean anything.<p>This is not insignificant either. Time to fuzz an application no longer matters for the attacker. If he grinds on it long enough he will have a vuln that the authors aren&#x27;t aware of (and can&#x27;t&#x2F;won&#x27;t even find now). It doesn&#x27;t matter if it takes 2 years to find a vuln in your code... Someone will do it."

Re: JavaScript and networking:<p>My random observation tells that sadly most &quot;modern&quot; highly complex websites do it wrong and it can hardly be any worse (this applies to all web products I&#x27;ve been working on for last several years):<p>1) analytics beacons fired every N seconds (which means the network stack on mobile never goes to idle mode)<p>2) JS frameworks doing event delegation that capture mousemove events and various other stuff like that + various setTimeout&#x2F;setInterval (perhaps from third-party code).<p>If you want a sample of 2) just open devtools &gt; debugger on any page and click &quot;pause&quot;.

"The title is misleading. Just to be clear, theory predicts that blacks holes shouldn&#x27;t be created between 50 and 130 solar masses, but there are plenty of black holes &gt;130 solar masses.

"This highlights one of the impacts that the internet has had on our society; the tyranny of the search result.<p>Precise results to queries, or results wrapped with irrelevant out of context, spam or just uninteresting near misses mean that our explorations are stymied.<p>The monopolies of knowledge provision (google, wikipedia) also mean that narrow groups (either tacitly through algorithmic design or directly through editorial decisions) control the associations of knowledge. The concerns of the organisations offering the knowledge are also reflected in the structure of the systems provided. Google is a money making operation, children do not make it money, therefore Google does not offer a children&#x27;s search engine (if I worked for Google I would be <i>ashamed</i> at how hard they make it for children to find things on the internet).<p>There are intentional manipulations, but these are not the fault of the internet providers (I believe, almost completely) and happened with dictionaries, encyclopedias and text books in any case. But what is new is the narrowness and exclusivity of information provision."

"I had always dreamed about a city without advertising, and couldn&#x27;t wait to visit São Paulo. And when I did, I was completely shocked to discover... I hated it.<p>Until you experience a lack of advertising, it&#x27;s hard to imagine quite how gray and boring and non-vibrant a city looks without it. Turns out billboards and panels full of dramatic movies and TV shows, beautiful smiling faces selling makeup and phones... actually add a lot of character to a city and make it feel like things are happening and going on.<p>Imagine if books no longer had graphic covers anymore, just all solid gray and beige and black covers, and you walked into a bookstore. It feels kind of like that.<p>If you&#x27;re going to get rid of advertising, at a minimum you&#x27;ve got to replace it with something -- like a <i>lot</i> of murals, like murals <i>everywhere</i>.

"&gt; The tiny organisms, known as phytoplankton, also gobble up carbon dioxide to produce half the world&#x27;s oxygen output—equaling that of trees and plants on land.<p>So does this mean there&#x27;s been a significant drop in oxygen (produced)? And if so, how much?<p>If 100% of phytoplankton produces 50% of the oxygen and 100% is now 60% that mean 50% of oxygen is down to 30%. In other words, sans a drop in non phytoplankton, total oxygen that was 100% is not 80%?<p>Wouldn&#x27;t we feel that?"

Interesting read.<p>But i bumped into the same problem recently while working on distributed simulation. I was writing an agent for an application which talks to clients over ssh.

"I studied under Carol Ward as an undergrad (years ago and no longer my profession). She was a great and dynamic professor so happy to see her get some national press.<p>Scientists are quick to claim descent because it is exciting. Louis Leakey made a career of it. While it is clearly a hominid fossil so there is no question of familial relatedness, human descent is a different question and absent genetic data we would need many hundreds or even thousands of fossils to be more definitive and there will always be gaps where we try to fill in missing data. As we have acquired and published additional finds over time, we have learned that the hominid tree is much more like a bush with numerous evolutionary &#x27;dead ends&#x27; (kind of a biased term implying they somehow weren&#x27;t good enough), so I think it is safe to say that the tree will remain in constant revision as new discoveries are made."

"It&#x27;s always annoyed me that buying a Starbucks coffee through their app (to skip the line) requires pre-loading a virtual card from your credit card, <i>minimum $10</i> even if it&#x27;s for just a $2.50 coffee.<p>Unlike most other apps (e.g. McDonald&#x27;s) that simply run each transaction through Apple Pay.<p>Just by virtue of using the app, I&#x27;ll always have some leftover money Starbucks will one day keep.

"I agree with the problem (“wanting to freeze the city in amber”), but not the solution, at least as the author wants to implement it. The solution would be to deregulate housing (rent control, etc) and let scarcity take over. Yes it’ll be painful for a couple of years, but when all the people who can’t afford to work at the Starbucks leave the city, people are going to start to notice. Wages and home building would shoot up to meet the demand, and things would ultimately level off. This will never happen in SF (the quasi-regulated NIMBYism the author describes seems par for the course), but we’d see some fast results if it did."

"Would this really be more efficient in term of cost&#x2F;performance?

"There were a lot of very interesting comments on a previous link &quot;What if Consciousness Came First&quot; [1] that I think shoehorn into this discussion pretty well.<p>Someone brought up the question of if there was a formal &quot;programming language&quot; for philosophy.

"The O&#x27;Reilly book Understanding The Linux Kernel is fantastic.  Starts you off in the deep end with memory management&#x2F;addressing and fans out from there.  Notably excludes networking, as the book is long enough without it."
"Far, far more harm is caused by a package repository electing itself as a censor than could ever be caused by a few additional chunks of ASCII turning up in a 4MB Travis CI log. Free software is supposed to be about freedoms, not having those freedoms dictated to me regarding what kind of software I can or cannot create.<p>There are limits to explore in this area, for example, I doubt anyone would disagree with censoring obvious malware. But for the rest? It is deeply political, and politicizing the distribution of free software is frankly repugnant. This puts me off spending much time with the JS ecosystem (not that I would have already), and worried about it setting precedents for ecosystems I actually do care about.<p>A glorified FTP server should never be telling you what kind of software you can write or how you package it. In this scenario, the glorified FTP server is no longer fit for purpose, and if such changes have community support, in my eyes that community is no longer a free software community."
"I just want to stop using JS on the browser side.<p>We can compile C to WASM, which gives us effectively most dynamic languages on the browser.  Say Python.

The fingerprint scanner was always a curious addition to me.

"I was in grad school when Wave hit. I was dumb founded when they cancelled it.  I&#x27;ve heard only a very few people whom tried it say they didn&#x27;t think it was awesome, which leads me to believe they didn&#x27;t kill it because of a lack of viability at all - they killed it because it competed with other strategic initiatives, imho.  This would have been the pre-slack killer easily.  Looking at it&#x27;s features (in conversation threads, drag and drop photos, adding folks to conversations, etc) one almost thinks it was the inspiration for slack even.<p>Anyway, Wave wasn&#x27;t killed because it wasn&#x27;t viewed as viable, it was killed for politics, which is probably why it&#x27;s creators and engineers were so pissed off. Shame."

"Carmack makes good point about VR in the beginning. For people who live in tight spaces  VR can be way to do conventional things like watch films and YouTube.

"Apart from the usual recommendations, to Firefox users I recommend enabling first-party isolation by setting &quot;privacy.firstparty.isolate&quot; to true.

"speculation on the origins of this ... in the San Francisco Bay Area, over the last twenty years, many ordinary downtown office+retail buildings became empty, due to some combination of suburban sprawl, loss of mom+pop retail, excessive rent-seeking and urban decay. Meanwhile, tons of twenty-somethings were arriving with a backpack and a laptop .. it was too fast and fluid for anyone to want an &quot;address&quot; .. so, the idea of flexible techie office &quot;pop-up&quot; shared spaces was obvious. Some tried it alone, and some tried to brand it with extras .. and FAILED FINANCIALLY.. practical people, who did try. If you have not failed this way, then you do not know how painful it can be, at the small business level.<p>At any rate, from one point of view, this WeWork thing is just the oversize &quot;winner&quot; from New York City, in this dog race.

"Hm, difficult topic, I can see both sides. I&#x27;d be interested what would happen if npm decided to add a &#x27;contains-ads&#x27; metadata field which package authors can set to true if they want to display adds. By default, those packages would not be listed when searched, and would not be be installable, except the user sets an &#x27;accept ad-packages&#x27; flag for that (or all) packages (opt-in), on the client side.<p>I guess the main problem is that developers (rightly, in my way) think that the usual suspects of suggested open-source funding methods which rely on deliberate actions from users (donations, etc.) are not really feasible. Double-licensed copy-left at least requires users to make a decicsion to acquire a private license in case it&#x27;s necessary. But if you for some reason don&#x27;t want to use copy-left, I guess the ad model would seem like an option, as it does not require the user to do anything.<p>What I suggested above would take care of the fact that unwanted ads are pushed upon the user, and users would have to make an active decision to allow ads if they wanted to use a certain package. I&#x27;d be interested how many people who complain about this idea right now, would still be principled enough to not install such a package in the case where the package is high-quality, and there is no good alternative around..."

"I worked on Encarta in the mid 90s. Here are a few tidbits you may or may not find interesting.<p>* The content was based on Funk &amp; Wagnalls. Then we had a bunch of editors and writers cleaning up the content and adding new articles.<p>* The Windows version was always done first, then we ported to the Mac using &quot;WLM&quot; (Windows Library for Mac?).<p>* We used fractal compression for the images. If you never heard of this, look it up—pretty interesting. This was going to be all the rage, but then it wasn&#x27;t.<p>* As a consumer product, Christmas sales were everything. Therefore, unlike most software, the schedule never slipped. There was a hard date for completion. Features would be cut to make the deadline, no matter what.<p>* When the web hit, we put professionally curated links into the articles. Best of both worlds. And you could get a subscription that would update articles and links monthly.<p>* We worked with WBUR to implement a brand-new closed captioning standard for videos.<p>* The codebase was ostensibly C++ and MFC, but it..was..complicated.<p>* Articles were edited in Word, with a bunch of custom macros, and exported to RTF. There was a lot more processing that went on after that to shove all that content onto the CD, but I wasn&#x27;t too familiar with that  part.<p>* Later versions occupied more than one CD.

"As a tinkerer:<p>1. I can read the official specs without agreeing to an onerous license.<p>2. There are several open source implementations I can choose to run on an FPGA.<p>3. I can choose the simplest combination of features. Want a multiply instruction, but no branch prediction? Want caching but no MMU requiring multi-level address virtualization?<p>A large processor vendor has to employ a small army of processor designers. The trend will always be in the direction of adding more features and increasing complexity. Customers will write code to require those features, and the cycle continues.<p>Only very rarely a fresh design will appear having the right combination of attributes to give it a chance of being a viable platform for a long time.

"I worked in Amazon&#x27;s Audiobook space for a while.<p>The thing with Audiobooks is, Audible never bought a physical item from a publisher they have an licensing agreement, which puts then into a very different space.  That agreement could be with
1. Major Publishers Audiobook publishing group, for a recorded audiobook 
2. An independent audiobook publisher, for a recorded audiobook
3. Directly with the author for rights to publish, for the rights to publish 
4. Directly with the publisher for rights to publish, for the rights to publish 
Further, there are Geographic rights publishers only have rights to publish in specific regions. A UK publisher could buy worldwide rights for ebook, print, audio from the author and then license US eBook&#x2F;Print rights to one publisher and Audio rights to someone else.<p>The eBook publication rights usually are with the authors publisher, but they can be owned by another publisher (see Open Roads media), or the author.<p>The problems here is separate publishers have rights to the ebook and audiobook rights.  Take Harry Potter, Tim Ditlow from Listening Library bought the audiobook rights for $15k before the book was “big”.  Ignore that his company was bought to keep this understandable.  If you buy the audiobook and use this feature, the eBook publisher gets nothing which sets up some big conflicts.<p>Traditional publishers have been pushing for audiobook rights to be part of book deals for a while, the concerning thing I see here is that a response to this could kill the independent audiobook publishers which would take a lot of checks out of authors hands."
"I like &#x27;Better Explained&#x27;[1]. It specifically focuses on intuitive understanding of mathematics.<p>A post I like is on adding numbers 1 to 100 [2]. The staple formula is n(n+1)&#x2F;2, sum of arithmetic progression. How can we intuitively arrive that this formula?<p>&gt; <i>Technique 1: Pair Numbers
Pairing numbers is a common approach to this problem. Instead of writing all the numbers in a single column, let’s wrap the numbers around, like this:<p>1  2  3  4  5<p>10 9  8  7  6<p>An interesting pattern emerges: the sum of each column is 11. As the top row increases, the bottom row decreases, so the sum stays the same.<p>Because 1 is paired with 10 (our n), we can say that each column has (n+1). And how many pairs do we have?

That doesn’t need to be his take but it would be nice to see one.<p>On the other hand, maybe I should leave well enough alone.

"One thing I don&#x27;t see very often but is intensely useful is that you don&#x27;t always have to make a choice.  The &quot;Add Playlist&quot; example is a case of &quot;why not both?&quot; -- have it at the bottom of the list, have it in the header of the list, sure, throw one in the menu as well. The user journeys can be either &quot;I came here to add a playlist&quot;, &quot;Hey, here are playlists, I should make one&quot;, and &quot;Oh, they don&#x27;t have the playlist I want, I&#x27;ll make one&quot;, and all of those end up in different places. The Material-style &quot;+&quot; in the corner is in my mind almost always the worst case -- if everyone did it, then it wouldn&#x27;t be so bad, but it&#x27;s a thing you never think to look for with an unfamiliar UI.<p>I like the discussion of &quot;Poisson&quot; options; thinking about the distribution of inputs is an important factor.

"This was a pretty good read. I use containers quite a lot on my server at home at maintain a bunch of utilities. Mostly I&#x27;m using systemd-nspawn.<p>&gt; User namespaces have been around since the 3.12 kernel, but few other container management systems use the feature to isolate their containers. Part of the reason for that is the difficulty in sharing files between containers because of the UID mapping. LXD is currently using shiftfs on Ubuntu systems to translate UIDs between containers and the parts of the host filesystem that are shared with it. Shiftfs is not upstream, however; there are hopes to add similar functionality to the new mount API before long.<p>This is exactly the problem I&#x27;ve run into. If you&#x27;re trying to share files between containers or between the host and a container (e.g. with systemd-nspawn&#x27;s &quot;--bind&quot; option), it&#x27;s <i>much</i> harder to have your permissions set properly and still access them from in the container if you&#x27;re using user namespacing.<p>There&#x27;s also the issue of creating the container in the first place. If you follow the instructions for creating a container on the Arch Wiki[1], the files will end up owned by the host&#x27;s root (mostly), which is a problem when you then try to boot the container as a different (namespaced) user. I don&#x27;t know of a straightforward way to create a namespaced container with systemd-nspawn, and I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s any way to convert an existing container to a namespaced container.<p>Yet another problem that sometimes arises is that various distributions have user namespacing disabled (it has to be enabled when the kernel is built) - notably Arch [2], though this may have recently changed. This is apparently due to concerns that the namespacing code is buggy and can itself lead to privilege escalation vulnerabilities.<p>[1] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.archlinux.org&#x2F;index.php&#x2F;Systemd-nspawn#Examples"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.archlinux.org&#x2F;index.php&#x2F;Systemd-nspawn#Examples</a><p>[2] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bugs.archlinux.org&#x2F;task&#x2F;36969"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bugs.archlinux.org&#x2F;task&#x2F;36969</a>"

"IBM over the past couple of decades have been gradually shifting away from hardware and more into a service provider.  Yes they still do their mainframe style behemoths and their AS&#x2F;400&#x27;s (not sure what branding they have upon those now ?-series last I touched that field) and with those have consolidates much upon the power CPU (least the AS&#x2F;400 stuff).<p>What I do wonder is - what will they do with AIX?  As I do foresee it going the way of Solaris, and the parallels to their CPU architecture do seem somewhat uncanny.<p>Personally I have a little mixed feelings about this having used IBM&#x27;s first ever attempt at a RISC CPU in the RT6150 and got one of the first (before public release) hands on the power 1 cpu used in an RS&#x2F;6000.<p>I also do find it interesting how an instruction set is so coveted in a day and time that compilers are so mature that  to create your own ISA and adapt a compiler to accommodate it is not out of the grasp of an individual and much more easier a task than days prior.  But then the real hard work is designing a CPU to run that instruction set, that becomes very much more than a one-person job.   Though who knows - maybe in 10-20 years from now, the ability to design some silicon becomes as accessible as programming in SCRATCH (drag and drop style design&#x2F;programming).<p>But back to the Power Architecture, what is IBM&#x27;s real plans here - charity&#x2F;PR or a way to shift processor design into a realm of outsourcing that enables them to focus upon their more profitable streams and focus - like services?  Maybe.<p>Though I do feel they may of missed the boat upon this, what with Apple at one stage a big Power cpu user and now looking to shift towards ARM, of which they design their own CPU&#x27;s.  Could Apple embrace this opertunity or would the transition be a cross to hard for them to bear?   That is for me one of the signs on how this will traction.  If Apple shows interest, then this could be epicly big.  Not saying that if they don&#x27;t that it will fail.  But do feel that had they did this 5-10 years ago, things would of been more likely to traction and grow.  Today, beyond some niche area&#x27;s, I&#x27;m not so sure it will be as epic as it could of been and may just be a case of too little too late.  
Equally I&#x27;m mindful that whilst IMHO it is too late to have as big an impact as it could of been, it may prove damaging towards RISC V CPU progression and by splitting the options open - may well damage both and only aid the existing Intel and Arm options out there."

"Typing on an ipad will makes this easier I hope. Having correct punctuation and stuff takes quite a long while using the virtual keyboards. Maybe this writing app is not for fast, lighting-speed thoughts; but for seeing how bottlenecking your interaction with the writer allows you to construct flows in a more coherent way. I mean, having five seconds to find where a key is not a difficult task and when writing a sentence takes quite a while, you find it easy to construct a continuation of it. Thus, you are able to write sentences flowing freely from your mind. If I was doing 150 words per minute on a real keyboard, I would have less than a second to think about what follows my current thought. When the sentences flow slowly, my mind searches deeply in the background, expanding my train of thought. I mean really, having a slow keyboard is like cheating here."

"I have started to learn Julia recently after some following the news. The addition of a debugger finally decided me to give a try. For the record I have been using Python for scientific programming before numpy existed, also a little Matlab too.<p>Since my experiments are just some simple implementations of kmeans and bandits epsilon greedy algorithms take what I&#x27;m going to say with a grain of salt. Anyway:<p>I find Julia very interesting. I managed to make kmeans fast with type annotations. If I were to summarize I would say that Julia is a much better cython. I never managed for example to debug cython. Profiling also seems to work in Julia, another thing very hard to do in Python. On the other hand, as in cython, sometimes you don&#x27;t know if some missing type annotation is slowing your program. It remains to be seen if the &quot;verbosity&quot; of type annotations is going to help or slow its adoption."
"I didn&#x27;t see the terms on that Tiger capital round anywhere online (very cursory search tho, so I&#x27;m open to being wrong!), but they raised $75 just 2 months ago.

"A few comments are saying that forests capture a lot of CO2.<p>But how could that be? If a forest doesn&#x27;t change over thousands of years it cannot be accumulating carbon in any significant quantity. Or else where would that material go?<p>The Amazon trees are about as tall and wide today as they were 10,000 years ago, and only so many of them fit on a given area. If the amount of vegetation remains the same the only way for a forest to capture carbon would be to accumulate an ever-increasing layer of it under the forest floor. That would be a lot of combustible material accumulated over millions of years that Amazon was around, and I&#x27;m pretty sure it isn&#x27;t there (otherwise certain people would be mining it already).<p>Amazon is not scrubbing carbon out of the air, and neither does any other forest of static size. The carbon has to go into the ground to remain sequestered."

"I worked at a firm who’s stated goal was for all the street to have the Terminal on one monitor and our product on the other.

Also it logged you out every 30 minutes!

"I&#x27;m a bit surprised by many of the arguments posted here trying to problematize paper votes. This is how it is done in Sweden - I don&#x27;t want to imply that it&#x27;s without issues, but it should illustrate how all of the &quot;issues&quot; with paper ballots are resolvable.<p>* Prior to election, all registered voters get a personal &quot;voting card&quot; sent to their home address. The letter also tells you which polling station you have been assigned.<p>* On election day, each voter goes to the polling station they have been assigned. You need your ID but not necessarily your voting card.<p>* Staff verify your ID and you go behind a blind where you put paper ballots (with the option to vote for a party, and, optionally, for a candidate in that party) in sealed envelopes, one for each level you are voting on.<p>* You go back to the staff with your sealed envelopes, staff mark you as having voted and put the envelopes in boxes.<p>* At the closing of election day, doors are closed, boxes are opened and ballots are counted at the location with multiple people overseeing each step in the process. The results of this counting is announced the day after as a preliminary result.<p>* Ballots then get put in tamper-proof bags and transported (again, with oversight) to a hub per district where counting is done again. Final results are announced about 10 days after election.<p>* Voters who can&#x27;t vote on their assigned location on election day can vote in advance at any location. The process works the same, except the sealed envelopes are put in another envelope, together with the voter card mentioned above. These ballots are saved for election day, when they are counted together with the normal votes.<p>* There are also mechanisms for voting via mail (arguably less secure) or at embassies in foreign countries. The process is similar as for advance votes.<p>* The public is invited to be physically present to monitor the counting of votes.<p>There&#x27;s zero machinery involved. The votes are anonymous, yet double-voting is prevented. Counting is done more than once by default. I understand from here that the U.S. is exceptional in that you can&#x27;t expect registered voters to have a strong ID. I am sure some kind of strong voter IDs could be issued (for free, obviously) that can accommodate for that.<p>I can not imagine that doing manual recounting of votes and ensuring integrity with manual labor is significantly more costly than the contracts with voting machine suppliers. If it is, it&#x27;s worth it. In my opinion, provably fair, free and anonymous voting is the killer app for blockchain. It is still a theoretically unsolved problem, however, and until we get there (if we ever do), machine-less paper voting is strictly better than both electronic voting and electronic counting of votes. If anything, the manual counting can be <i>supplemented</i> by electronic counting machines.<p>You think the U.S. is unique and this won&#x27;t work because of federalization?

One thing I find weird (probably because I’m new to JMAP and still ignorant) is having <i>position</i> AND <i>anchor</i>+<i>anchorOffset</i>. Why have both?

"This nonsense gets repeated over and over again:<p><i>What you get is what you build. New roads just create more incentive for driving.

"&gt; Selling a paperless voting machine is like selling a car without brakes<p>This is comical FUD.<p>What makes people think paper is safer? The paper copy you have is worthless since you can counterfeit it, and the one in storage can be replaced or falsified just the same. A secure system can be designed regardless of the storage media - i.e. a digital one can be as safe or safer than paper. Brazil has used electronic voting for decades now, and despite accusations (by the winning party!) there has been no proof of tampering or exploitable security flaws."
"The part about dynamism echoes a thought that I had earlier today. As far as I can tell, socialism as an economic system largely failed [1] because of a lack of dynamism. Because everything is state-owned, everything is &quot;too big to fail&quot; and all management structures petrify. It doesn&#x27;t have the same regenerative properties that exist in all living and evolving systems, the controlled killing of old parts of the system without killing the entire system that in capitalism is provided by competition on the free market.<p>The question is: Is there any socialist theory that provides a solution to this lack of dynamism? I&#x27;m asking not necessarily because I want socialism, but because pure free-market capitalism has some obvious flaws when it comes to natural monopolies and the pricing of externalities, so I&#x27;d like to know if there is a better system that doesn&#x27;t devolve into the real-world socialism we&#x27;ve already seen.<p>[1] I&#x27;m not disputing that socialist regimes did horrendous things to their subjects, but I&#x27;m focusing on the economic perspective here."

"That seems really irresponsible, the car would be very hard to see if you approach it from the rear at night, especially if the driver installs covers over the brake lights to make them darker.  A few years ago where I live in the USA there was a news story being run about a controversial decision to not charge a driver who hit and killed somebody at night because the person they hit was black, wearing all black clothes, and walking in the street.  I don&#x27;t imagine a car painted with a material known to make the car close to invisible against a dark back drop would do any better in court if it was rear-ended."
"After a very long time, this is a fine piece of investigative journalism to make the top 30 on HN. I wish the main BuzzFeed site did more of this than the clicbait."
"Their shipping practices have also degraded. Amazon usually ships anything they can in bubble-padded envelopes. This is ok for many things, but for books it&#x27;s a disaster - softcovers almost always end up with damaged covers, hardcovers get dented corners from being dropped without any protection. I&#x27;ve also received movies and video games with cases damaged worse than what you&#x27;d see in a second-hand store. The (supremely ironic) result is that Amazon is now my last choice for buying books."
Truth is ad buyers don’t want to be associated with any controversial content and a majority of Americans still feel uncomfortable about Gay and lesbian issues and even more uncomfortable about transgender issues. It’s smart for advertisers to exclude lgbt content from their ads if they don’t think that’s a target demographic

Really ads in a terminal is a needless attack vector that is a dumpster fire for security that is part of the reason &#x2F;why&#x2F; they have so many detractors.
"Currently I remain skeptical, 130 pages in 7 months plus meaningful experiments is quite some going. A list of the papers (so at least the authors can defend themselves), the source code and data used (because some of these methods require social media inputs) would definitely help.<p>After doing so much work though, why wouldn&#x27;t you go the extra small few steps to publish? That way the work can be peer reviewed and the Scientific community has a chance to learn from it."

"Is there anything wrong with a country monitoring the opinions which can be likened to propaganda that people are exposed to online? Every person&#x27;s opinion is a form of bias, every country has its own law&#x27;s but who is right? The biggest group of aligned points of view or minority groups with aligned points of view? Why would a tech company like Mozilla or Google want to undermine the legal system in a country?"
"Nice to know, but it&#x27;s kinda unfair of how it&#x27;s gleefully perceived by many as a success of OSS.

Are any&#x2F;all of these uniquely constrained to describing either a design (on paper) or that design&#x27;s physical implementation in hardware?"
"I think the ultimate source of Seattle&#x27;s wishy-washy attitude toward serious crime is summed up nicely by an excerpt from something written by Ilhan Omar:<p>&gt; The desire to commit violence is not inherent to people — it is the consequence of systematic alienation; people seek violent solutions when the process established for enacting change is inaccessible to them. Fueled by disaffection turned to malice, if the guilty were willing to kill and be killed fighting perceived injustice, imagine the consequence of them hearing, “I believe you can be rehabilitated. I want you to become part of my community, and together we will thrive.”  We use this form of distributive justice for patients with chemical dependencies; treatment and societal reintegration.  The most effective penance is making these men ambassadors of reform.<p>Basically, criminals are protestors against the inequity of society.  This is a very old idea.  Dostoevsky talks about it in Crime and Punishment.<p>My sense is that, no, people committing crimes are not &quot;protestors&quot; and treating them as such simply doesn&#x27;t work.  Tough love works.  Punishment works.<p>I just hope that, when the pendulum swings back on this nonsense, it doesn&#x27;t swing back too far the other way.  I think it probably will, though."

"The impression I get from that thread is that the dream here is now Americans can do what they do best, sit in the middle of transactions and collect rent.  Previously, you could go to a Chinese website and have the Chinese factory send you a widget directly to your door.  Now that will be too expensive, but hey we have a solution!  An American will order a bunch of widgets in bulk, ship them over in a cargo ship, come up with some fancy marketing, and then sell the widgets to you at 200% markup.  You know these folks will never hire electrical engineers to certify safety and conformance, or work with the factory to improve the product in response to customer feedback.  They&#x27;re there to do one thing: sit in the middle of the transaction and charge Chinese manufacturers for the privilege of selling to Americans.<p>But hey, look on the bright side... at least there is someone you can sue when your widget blows up."

"&gt; <i>&quot;91% of remote workers said working remotely is a good fit for them.&quot;</i><p>Right, and 97% of current ferret owners say that ferrets make great pets [0]. I&#x27;d like the survey to include people who worked remotely in the past and no longer do. Count me in that group. I worked remotely for a six months at a remote-friendly but not remote-first company and here were my findings:<p>* It was lonely being at home. And I wasn&#x27;t as productive. After a month, I rented space at a WeWork, which helped with both problems. But it requires that you be outgoing to meet people who work in your space but aren&#x27;t your coworkers.<p>* I didn&#x27;t like being physically separated from my colleagues. It meant that I wasn&#x27;t privy to many of the important conversations in the company.<p>* I was always afraid that come a round of layoffs that it&#x27;s easier to fire the folks who work 1000 miles away.<p>* In a company that isn&#x27;t remote first, it limits your career growth (most of the time).<p>* Maybe it&#x27;s just me, but I find it much easier to explain difficult technical things in person. Yes, screenshares are very helpful, but sometimes a hard problem involves going back and forth between monitors, for example. I also like being able to use a whiteboard [1].<p>* As a software engineer, it&#x27;s easy to get siloed into only communicating with people on your team and remote work only increases this tendency. If you work in an office, you meet people from other parts of the business in the cafeteria&#x2F;break room&#x2F;etc. and that allows you to have a more full understanding of the company. And it&#x27;s my belief that if you don&#x27;t understand the business, then you don&#x27;t understand what your software should be doing.<p>Overall, I didn&#x27;t hate working remotely but it wasn&#x27;t great either. I would do it again for a short period of time (e.g. a year while my wife is on sabbatical) without hesitation, but I personally didn&#x27;t like it for the long term. That said, the ability to work remotely <i>on occasion</i> is something that&#x27;s very important to me.<p>I personally wouldn&#x27;t apply to jobs at remote-only companies, but I definitely think this is the way to go if you want to make a career out of working remote as it solves a few of the problems above.<p>[0] Not saying that they don&#x27;t, for some people. Just saying that asking people who currently own ferrets means your sample is biased.<p>[1] Sometimes old fashioned is best. One of my companies moved to a new office and was thinking of installing &quot;smart boards&quot; at a cost of tens of thousands of dollars, thinking that the engineers would love them. To their surprise, the engineers protested and asked for good quality &quot;dumb&quot; boards instead."
"One important part about learning how the Linux kernel works is understanding the details of the system&#x27;s interface the kernel provides.

"Removing adverse incentives is a step in the right direction! Now, any employee at a copyright holder assigned to send out manual copyright claims will become a <i>cost center.</i> No longer will copyright holders be able to justify such assignments via <i>captured revenue from creators</i> - instead, they will legitimately need to value the cost of the claiming against the actual damages done to the copyright holder made by the sharing of copyrighted music.<p>On the other hand, there are a lot of music videos on YouTube that copyright holders might have been fine allowing to exist, and now their only option is to nuke them from orbit.

"So many of the reactions seem to be &quot;I don&#x27;t believe it, they don&#x27;t care, they&#x27;re evil&quot;, but that doesn&#x27;t strike me as being particularly useful or realistic, because it misunderstands one very important fundamental human dynamic: the vast majority of villains think that they are the hero. Much harm is caused by those that don&#x27;t understand that they are harming others. Many that knowingly do harm think that their doing harm serves a higher, more important purpose that, in fact, demands they continue that pattern of harm. Leaders of all stripes do things that are harmful, believing that the ends justify the means and that they are in fact doing good by doing harm.<p>This statement helps empower employees to say to illustrate to their corporate leadership that they are not, in fact, doing such a great job of being good guys. I have personally gone to managers that I work for and said &quot;I think we need to invest in our employees more&quot; and been told &quot;we&#x27;re not in the business of growing our employees&quot;. I&#x27;ve had managers that state that have demonstrated wanting the things that I want but refusing to act on those wants because they believe that those wants are selfish and immature, and that acting counter to their actual desires is a form of discipline that serves a higher purpose. Many believe this is good management like making your kid eat their vegetables in spite of their protest is good parenting.<p>For example, I have been in positions where I wanted to move on from old technologies and reported to engineering managers who also wanted to move on from old technology. I&#x27;ve even seen them demonstrate this by learning the newer tools and building side projects with them. Those same managers still could not be convinced to go to bat for the newer tools because they do not believe that they have a mandate to help their employees grow. I&#x27;ve personally seen leadership and especially middle managers make decisions based solely on the statement of shareholder value and ask how, for example, modernizing tooling helps shareholders.<p>This document strikes me as incredibly helpful to workers in the position that want to advocate for their own career growth. If you agree with these principles, do not look on it with skepticism. Instead, view it as a tool in your own arsenal that you can use to advocate for positive change in your own org."

Behaviors that impact the rest of use negatively.  And we all know that a lot of that behavior has nothing to do with drug use in the first place. But it&#x27;s a lot harder to deal with the behavior issue because then you&#x27;re dealing with things like mental health issues and large-scale economic issues, on top of drug abuse.<p>It&#x27;s so much easier to just use drugs as a scapegoat and start locking people up. Like the Boomers did! But we know that doing so is monumentally stupid and ineffective so we need a different way. Props to Seattle for trying a different way, but just as we&#x27;ve seen here in SF, these half-assed measures do as much to encourage anti-social behavior as they do to mitigate it. I think these West Coast cities being besieged by the nice-weather homelessness epidemic (and associated drug use) are going to have to come up with something a little tougher than what they&#x27;ve found the political will for so far. But we also have to acknowledge that we can&#x27;t, won&#x27;t and never should return to the idiotic War on Drugs."

But actually property developers do have the option to go outside the law, just like uber. Or maybe not them, but people do anyways.

"Hopefully nobody reading the article ends up disappointed knowing that the type checking presented is SBCL-only, working only for a subset of the Common Lisp type system (which itself is large and elaborate), with only informal guarantees of compile-time support, and doesn’t come close to allowing any sort of type checking with polymorphism or sum-types involved. None of those take away from the value SBCL’s type checking provides; the features presented <i>do</i> catch <i>real</i> bugs in <i>real</i> code, and I’d prefer those features are there than not there. If you are disappointed, however, then...<p>Coalton [1] is a project that adds tried-and-true Hindley-Milner type checking to Common Lisp which allows for gradual adoption, in the same way Typed Racket or Hack allows for. You can think of Coalton as an embedded DSL in Lisp that resembles Standard ML or OCaml, but lets you seamlessly interoperate with non-statically-typed Lisp code (and vice versa).<p>It’s really intended as a practical tool to allow parts or most of your codebase to be statically typed, without compromising the dynamic and interactive nature of Common Lisp.<p>On top of it all you get all of the facilities of Lisp, like macros, compile-time evaluation, etc. Coalton code <i>is</i> truly Lisp code, it’s just—at the end of the day—extra syntax to allow a type checker (also Lisp!) to run. As a benefit, it allows quasi-trivial porting of ML-like code to Lisp. Almost all ML construct has a direct correspondence in Coalton.<p>It’s still a work in progress, especially in terms of polish and documentation, but it works.<p>Shen [2] is another interesting project, but I didn’t generally find it very compatible with the ML style of program construction, and it seemed to have goals diverging from being an extension of Lisp, into being some hyper-portable independent language.<p>[1] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;stylewarning&#x2F;coalton"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;stylewarning&#x2F;coalton</a><p>[2] <a href=""http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.shenlanguage.org&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.shenlanguage.org&#x2F;</a>"

I get that this is a big challenge for new folks working with typical unix shells, but I&#x27;m not sure I see how this actually solves it. In order to avoid all those flags, a system like this requires more verbs overall, and those verbs have their own argument structure, eg `split-column &quot; | &quot; firstname lastname job`, so now instead of being able to label the arguments and order them how I want, I now have to remember the order they come in, and what they mean, and that `split-column &quot; &quot;` apparently eats extra whitespace (does `split-column &quot; | &quot;`?). Yes, the standard unix tools have these issues, as well. That&#x27;s my point.<p>So yes, I love this idea, please keep pursuing it, and I look forward to trying it out. But focus on the benefits of working with structured data rather than pushing lines that sound good but aren&#x27;t actually true."

"&gt; We find this passage from Shoshana Zuboff’s The Age of Surveillance Capitalism to be apt:
“Demanding privacy from surveillance capitalists or lobbying for an end to commercial surveillance on the internet is like asking old Henry Ford to make each Model T by hand.

These demands are existential threats that violate the basic mechanisms of the entity’s survival.”<p>This quote is hilarious, but if, as the article suggests, privacy-invading, tracking-based ads aren&#x27;t much better than content and region-based ads, presumably advertising companies like Google could abandon it and still provide similar value to their customers.<p>It might even save time, resources, and money since they wouldn&#x27;t need to put as much effort into tracking."

"A more obscure feature is the uncommon usage of comma operator. We often use the comma operator in variable declaration and in for loops. But it can also be used in any expression.<p>For instance, the next line has a valid C construct:<p><pre><code>   return a, b, c;
</code></pre>
This is particularly useful for setting variable when retuning after an error.<p><pre><code>   if (ret = io(x))
       return errno = 10, -1;
</code></pre>
The possibilities are endless. Another example:<p><pre><code>    if (x = 1, y = 2, x &lt; 3)

It has it&#x27;s own aesthetic.

"First, centralized logging is not just a good idea -- its key when you start working with multiple servers (which will most likely be almost right away).  You need to be able to trace requests &#x2F; responses &#x2F; errors across your platform.  Many tools (including logging library -&gt; database and a custom log search &#x2F; viewer) can give you this.  Just pick something that works for your budget and development process and start there.  To track a single chain of events, you&#x27;ll just need to have a GUID that you pass between calls in a single request (used for logging).<p>Next, you&#x27;ll want to track analytics centrally.  Etsy and Netflix have been pioneers in this area.  Their engineering blogs are very good to follow.  Think: something like a timeseries database (like Influx &#x2F; Prometheus) and getting data into it.  Use tools like Grafana to get data out of it in dashboards or reports.  This is separate from your application debug &#x2F; error logging system.<p>The next step after this is developing something that consumes data from both of those systems and provides alerts based on unusual activity -- something that provides early warning to devops."

I started working with Python around 2013 and I still consider Django the best framework to use.

Django is constantly updated and I have little to no worries about security issues.<p>Edit: And I have been following new projects such as starlette which I have really enjoyed but I have not bought into the idea of why I need async database access.
"This is a good read. The difficulty of transporting large wind components over land is one reason that onshore wind turbines have lower maximum capacities vs. offshore turbines. The largest onshore turbine is 5.3 megawatts [1] while the largest offshore turbine is 9.5 megawatts [2]. Transporting super-large components by sea is easier -- no tunnels, bridges, or winding roads to worry about.<p>Very tall turbines tend to improve capacity factor and project economics by tapping steadier winds found further away from the ground. For onshore projects, at least, that benefit is in tension with the more difficult transport and assembly logistics noted in this article.<p>Solar has the logistics edge in that all of the components for a solar farm are much smaller and weigh less. Even the largest individual solar modules are under 40 kilograms each. Racking systems are also assembled out of smaller pieces. No oversized loads need to be transported to the solar farm site. There are more truckloads of components for a 400 megawatt solar farm vs. a 400 kilowatt farm, but the individual components and trucks need be no larger.<p>[1] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.genewsroom.com&#x2F;press-releases&#x2F;ges-largest-onshore-wind-turbine-prototype-installed-and-operating-netherlands"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.genewsroom.com&#x2F;press-releases&#x2F;ges-largest-onshor...</a><p>[2] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wind-turbine-models.com&#x2F;turbines&#x2F;1605-mhi-vestas-offshore-v164-9.5-mw"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wind-turbine-models.com&#x2F;turbines&#x2F;1605-mhi-vestas-...</a>"
"I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a combination of both some unwillingness and some inability. I think the unwillingness would come more from a desire to avoid a murky, difficult to execute &amp; resource intensive process, and not from a purely mercenary desire to sell more product. Because it would be a better shopping experience and spur more activity if there was greater trust in the 3rd party marketplace.<p>The inability stems mainly from the same problem large content aggregators always have. Like Youtube&#x27;s filter generating false positives or false negatives for blocking content or flagging IP issues, or the filter for Youtube Kids letting through inappropriate content. It&#x27;s all too much to adequately police without unreasonably high (from their perspective) resources."

  - Development time is slower than writing in regular JS&#x2F;React. This started to become a major issue due to the nature of our project being a prototype (fast iterations on ideas and features).

"This article is fluff. Presented with a gosh-this-is-cool-isnt-it narrative, nothing here suggests senior engineer.

Software is semi-formal at best and more a hidden Markov chain at best. Indeed the central questions to software engineering are deferred as questions."
"I’ve had a series of realizations that have helped me with this.<p>First was that I noticed that on most of my usual internet hangouts, the norm was that if someone is replying to a comment, it must be a disagreement. Even the occasional agreement is often mistaken for disagreement because it’s so uncommon for folks to post in agreement.  The more I noticed this pattern, the less inclined I became to follow it.<p>Second was noticing just how much time and energy I would spend taking down someone’s post in my head, even if I had gotten up from the computer and was doing something else. And while there is something exhilarating about refining an argument, clarifying one’s own thoughts, and then posting them and watching for upvotes, there’s also a very negative energy associated with it that I found lasted a while afterwards. So I came to believe it wasn’t a good trade off.<p>Finally, a tangential realization. At work I noticed a pattern in others and then in myself where product or technical suggestions would be made and then developers would instantly chime in with the reasons it can’t be done.  But it can be done, we have the source code, and our job is to find a way to do it. Dismissing it because our first thought doesn’t work is simply not doing our job. So I learned to suppress any reactions until I’d actually attempted to enable whatever was suggested, and I think this had an effect elsewhere in my life, including posting on the internet."
"I was at a Big Dumb Corp in 2005 or so on a client dedicated team. Our group manager decided to have everyone on the team take turns leading the weekly staff meeting.

"I&#x27;m surprised this article doesn&#x27;t optimize a little further.  If you want to compute σ(n), and you can prime factor n, there&#x27;s no need to go determining all the divisors of n and then adding them up.  The σ function is multiplicative, i.e., one has σ(nm)=σ(n)σ(m) when (n,m)=1.  So if you&#x27;ve factored n = p_1^a_1 * ... * p_k^a_k, it suffices to compute σ(p_i^a_i) for each i and then multiply them together.<p>Meanwhile, while computing σ(p^a) can be done by summing, it can be done even more simply by noting that this is a geometric series and so sums to (p^(a+1)-1)&#x2F;(p-1).<p>Edit: Actually, not sure how this latter way compares to just doing Horner.  Probably about the same, I imagine.  I guess Horner would be the right way to do it if division is expensive for some reason."
"While I think that TS offers probably the best type system out ther, eg way better than Go&#x27;s, I&#x27;d love to see a more balanced view on TS in discussion threads like this one.<p>TS is a must for long-term code which should be maintainable in several years by teams. Any lead engineer with responsibility for some crucial app and dev team not using TS is doing something wrong. But using TS comes at a cost. Even when you are savvy in TS you won&#x27;t bang out code like with pure JS.<p>But especially in prototyping phases you need this fast-paced coding. And using TS or any type system slows you down, even when you are familiar with typed languages. Often your final code faced many iterations and I sometimes like to introduce TS later, usually at a point where I just need types but not always and as default from the first key press. In early stages I still try to test ideas, algorithms and their general feasibility and a fast &#x27;mind-to-code&#x27; interface is crucial and types would stay in the way then.<p>Further, finding the right type can take some time, just google what type a React&#x27;s children prop should be and find long discussions. Welcome to the TS-what-type-is-actually-xy-rabbit-hole. And declaring everything as any shouldn&#x27;t be the answer.<p>A big drawback are also TS error messages which are super hard to grasp. You get there and you even find tutorials just for understanding TS error messages but it&#x27;s unecessarily infuriating.<p>Moreover, VSCode, its TS language server are amazing pieces of tech but here you face also strange behaviours. Types get full Intellisense support while interfaces don&#x27;t which doesn&#x27;t make sense. So you need still to go the definition yourself and it&#x27;s not that IDE-like feeling you hoped for or people told you.<p>In my setups, I use TS instead of Babel but use both JS and TS files in one code base depending on the requirements and situation.<p>So, my message is, yes TS is great, has probably the best type system but the tonality by its community&#x2F;users needs to be much more balanced and less fanboy-ish. I just can&#x27;t take devs serious who praise TS to death. This is just not true. More, maintainable code is also not just created by a type system but also sane architectures (eg React) and many other factors. Types won&#x27;t make bad code maintainable. So, types have their place but not everything in TS-land is shiny."

Questioning instead of asserting is inherently less argumentative, is less threatening and more likely to cause the other side to seriously consider your point instead of reacting defensively automatically.

Could one do this for more different than network hardware classes?

"I&#x27;ve been saying something like this since the 1980s. But we knew back then that manipulation in unstructured situations was very hard. It still is.<p>Here&#x27;s the DARPA robot manipulation challenge, 2012.[1] This is pathetic. Especially since DARPA has been funding universities in this area since the 1960s. There&#x27;s a classic video of robotic assembly at Stanford SAIL in the 1960s I can&#x27;t find right now. It looks very similar, except that the video quality is worse.<p>The state of the art in autonomous mobile robots for unstructured environments is terrible. The state of the industry for that is worse. Willow Garage went bust. Google bought up some of the players, ran them into the ground, and dumped them. Schaft, the Tokyo University spinoff they bought, found no buyers at the selloff. (They had nice hardware, too.) Boston Dynamics is still around, feeding off of Softbank now, after feeding off Google and DARPA, but there are no selling products after 30 years. The USMC rejected their Legged Squad Support System. The performance level at the DARPA Humanoid Challenge was very poor.[2]<p>Even robot vacuum cleaners aren&#x27;t very good. You&#x27;d think they&#x27;d be doing offices and stores late at night by now, but they&#x27;re not. The Roomba, which has the intelligence of an ant (it&#x27;s from Rod Brooks, the insect AI guy) came out in 2002, and is only slightly smarter 17 years later.<p>Automatic driving is starting to work, after a few billion dollars was thrown at that problem. That, too, was harder than expected.<p>Drones, though. Drones are doing fine.<p>The real breakthrough in machine learning was the discovery that it could be used to target advertising. That doesn&#x27;t have to work very well to be useful. 
It&#x27;s easy to test. 80% success is fine. Now there&#x27;s money behind that field.<p>Embodied AI is really hard to work on, and very expensive. It&#x27;s easier than it used to be; you can buy decent robot hardware off the shelf, and don&#x27;t spend your time worrying about gear backlash and motor controllers. But it&#x27;s still way harder to test than something that runs in a web server.<p>The payoff is low. Robots in unstructured situations do the jobs of cheap people, and the robots are usually slower. After many decades of many smart people beating their head against the wall in this area, there&#x27;s been some progress, but not much. 
That&#x27;s why this isn&#x27;t happening yet.<p>However, being able to mooch off of technology being developed to serve the ad-supported industries that use AI does help.<p>[1] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=jeABMoYJGEU"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=jeABMoYJGEU</a><p>[2] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=nIyuC7ceFH0"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=nIyuC7ceFH0</a>"

An OS is just specialized software that provides services, but by providing those services and only those services, you&#x27;re locked into that OS, and all those services whether you want them or not.<p>And we have to do that because we don&#x27;t want all our software to have to provide the basic services, but we don&#x27;t really get that: we still have to provide all the libraries it needs, some of which emulate an OS anyway by providing a big, complex runtime.<p>So I don&#x27;t think this is an OS problem, it&#x27;s a build problem. If I can ask a machine what services it has, and ask the software what services it needs, it should be possible to find a minimal solution.<p>I think NixOS gets very close to this ideal, even though it&#x27;s obviously built on a traditional OS. But if we&#x27;re going to talk about the &quot;ultimate OS&quot; I think it&#x27;s worth it to ask, &quot;how much can we take away from this?&quot;<p>And the reason to want that is simply driving towards the goal of making software components that are able to work together reliably rather than building these monolithic devices that only a handful of veterans can understand."
I&#x27;m just here to thank whoever changed the title that used this as an opportunity to smear engineers. Levandowski was not an engineer. He was an executive and this type of behavior is completely in line with executive behavior.
"We signed up for Brave&#x27;s setup at PortableApps.com after a few users asked about it. They hold your last 90 days in escrow, so you can find out how successful it is once you sign up. We were looking at around 10 cents a day for a bit under a million monthly users for that timeframe over the summer. And we can&#x27;t even access it since Brave only works with one crypto provider and they aren&#x27;t licensed in New York. The process was also pretty buggy and the magic link email login was clunky&#x2F;kinda broken.<p><a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;portableapps.com&#x2F;node&#x2F;60580"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;portableapps.com&#x2F;node&#x2F;60580</a>"
"“De-risking is the art of reducing risk with the code that you deploy.<p>What all steps can you take to reduce the risk of disaster?”<p>Honestly, I talk about derisking most in two contexts in our projects: schedule, invention.<p>Normally this means that derisking is about frontloading unknowns and finding pivot decisions that reduce the likelihood of getting too far in the wrong direction or accumulating too much uncertainty.<p>I don’t use “risk” too often when talking about fault tolerant code or system design. If you’re taking on “risk” in code, like the chance of a lost message, a race condition, or corrupted data, I’m going to take away the keys.<p>Note: I encounter shoddy “we can go hours without a crash, so it’s good” work more than I’d like to admit.  It is possible to know why code and systems fail (and account for it) much more than has become industry norm these days."

"If your main concern is people scrapping your blog or only reading the RSS without visiting it directly, at least put the first paragraph in the feed.

"&gt;This leads to Stripe’s Negative Emissions Commitment. We will seek to purchase negative CO2 emissions at any price per tCO2, starting immediately. We expect that the best price will initially be very high: almost certainly more than $100 per tCO2, as compared to the $8 per tCO2 we pay for offsets. We don’t expect to be able to sequester all of our carbon emissions, both because the relevant technologies are not yet operating at sufficient scale, and because it would be financially infeasible for Stripe. And so we commit to spending at least twice as much on sequestration as we do on offsets, with a floor of at least $1M per year.<p>What is the difference between sequestration and offsets?"

"I don&#x27;t think &quot;assessing talent&quot; during interviewing is a skill you can learn. The skill you&#x27;re learning is assessing how well the candidate performed during the interviewing process. The interviewing process itself is what is assessing the talent.<p>Put another way, I would rather have a novice interviewer use a good process than have an experienced interviewer use a bad or mediocre process.<p>In my experience, FAANG-style whiteboard interviews are a bad process. They don&#x27;t work for assessing developers, and the skill of the interviewer can&#x27;t compensate for that. The only thing I have found that works consistently is some form of work-sample interview, where the candidate produces working code in their preferred development environment."

"One of the techniques of what Westerners call Stoicism is the negative visualization that Nemoto has his patients&#x2F;clients undergo - imagining you only have a few weeks to live, that you&#x27;ve lost your material wealth, that you&#x27;ve lost someone important to you, thinking about your death. Also, intentional self-deprivation.<p>&quot;A Guide to the Good Life: the Ancient Art of Stoic Joy&quot; was well worth reading and has a whole chapter on negative visualization as a means for overall more positive thinking."
"I&#x27;m starting to think that WeWork may be an interesting experiment on the current state of the stock market.  It&#x27;s not just HBR; Bloomberg and virtually every other mainstream financial news analysis outlet has had an article explaining why WeWork is overvalued at its current IPO price.<p>If it, nonetheless, sells at this price, it seems that it will more or less prove that IPOs don&#x27;t have much to do with the fundamentals."

"Apropos of not much I was just driving to an unfamiliar location and using the car Satnav. I was reminded why I actively avoid it. The text to speech mangles almost every street name, even completely commonplace English language names. &quot;Gracefield&quot; became Gra - ss - fie - lid or something. I implemented the simple Bethesda Naval Laboratory text to phoneme algorithm in the early 1980s based on a Steve Ciarcia article in Byte magazine and I&#x27;m <i>sure</i> it was better. Also I hear the OP on the subject of updates. I bought this car new less than 4 years ago, the Satnav regularly scolds me at ignition time to do an update - the dealer looked at me as if I was crazy &quot;No we can&#x27;t do updates - you should try and figure out how to do it yourself&quot;."

"My reaction to this article - we&#x27;ve utterly failed when it comes to training effective mid-level software engineering leaders. It feel like we are substituting rule by committee for what should ultimately be a leadership decision. If you cannot select engineers, you should not be leading them.<p>Employee Input is certainly welcome. We don&#x27;t want to hire jerks or idiots. But the manager is responsible and accountable for the quality of hires and employee performance.<p>The other half of my life is in manufacturing &#x2F; distribution. We have engineers too, managing great big piles of machinery. We RUN on engineers and mechanics. Generally led by engineers. Hell, my last CEO was a former engineer and my current COO (who runs the plants) is an engineer himself. It&#x27;s engineers, all the way up.<p>They don&#x27;t need to shop candidates all over the building to figure out if they can handle the job. They know. And can make an appropriate decision.<p>It starts with setting the expectation that engineering centered functions are to be led by engineers. And the price of leading those functions is knowing your stuff...<p>No Excuses."
"Since Brave is usually roasted around here, I just want to say thanks to the devs. I&#x27;m a Brave user and the experience is fantastic. Two things: I was a Chrome user for many years, so switching to Brave was not traumatic at all (same user experience, plugin&#x27;s compatibility) and also ad blockers work as expected.

"This is pretty scummy. If it becomes acceptable to display ads in the terminal, through popularization by usage in heavily relied upon packages like Standard, I imagine this will balloon fairly quickly into a common practice.<p>Thankfully this is all open source and standard doesn’t add much on top of eslint outside of rapid setup and a preset config, so I expect that the community will just make an ad-free version."

"Great piece. But if our goal is increased capacity, perhaps HS2 isn&#x27;t the best way to do it - are there cheaper and slower alternatives? And if this is an either&#x2F;or decision, there are alternative proposals that are absolutely worth of consideration - some scandalously poor situations up North for example. I just can&#x27;t help feeling this is yet another example of the public being stitched up by their taxes being funnelled to a financial bonanza for the politicians&#x27; chums."

"The level of greed, hubris and stupidity of some people never ceases to amaze me.<p>Levandowski was paid a bonus of $120 million while at Google, which is more money than any reasonable person will need for several lifetimes. This was actually a running joke at Google (while I was still there) to describe $120M as &quot;1 Levadownski&quot;. Like Sundar one year was described as earning &quot;only 1.7 Levadownskis&quot; (he got paid $200M one year).<p>Why someone would risk jail time doing something so clearly wrong (taking material trade secrets from an employer) for even more money is just staggering to me. Even if he escapes prison time the stress and cost of a protracted criminal trial is huge. The loss of reputation is likely permanent.<p>I get why some high fliers have big egos and they privatize their success (even when pure dumb luck can be a huge factor). This is the hubris part. Right or wrong, that belief in your own abilities is almost a prerequisite for disruption.<p>The interesting part is how he &quot;cheats&quot;. Like he clearly went to efforts to cover his tracks. Those aren&#x27;t the actions of someone who felt they didn&#x27;t do something questionable. So at this point, it&#x27;s not about the hubris of the individual, it&#x27;s about being <i>perceived</i> as being gifted, intelligent, a visionary and so on.<p>Honestly it makes me glad when such charlatan have their almost inevitable fall from grace."
"What&#x27;s a good tutorial for fuzzing? I work with many code bases in my consulting, none of which have come close to being &quot;fuzzed&quot;.

"This is becoming more and more of a problem as everything becomes more complex. I remember when I was a child my dad repaired the power switch on the vacume cleaner by going to the local electrical store and buying the exact same switch. Now every single device has its own custom part and the switch isn&#x27;t just connecting 2 wires, it&#x27;s contacting a main board telling it the button has been pressed triggering the power toggle code which will probably perform a bunch of checks and processes before powering on. If anything goes wrong you either have to replace half of the device if you can or just bin it because it would take you a lifetime to work out everything that happens when you press the power button."

"15 or so years ago, my manager at WalMart Stores Information Systems Division was previously a programmer on one of the many finance related teams.  Specifically, she worked with gift cards, and one time I asked her how different state laws affected how much money WalMart could recover from those cards.  She was <i>delighted</i> to elaborate!<p>I don&#x27;t recall the particulars of the answer, but it was eye-opening.  She said that they had a team of lawyers whose job was to (try to) keep track of all of the laws, all over the world, that had any bearing on this topic.  Not only was it state and federal law, but also county and even city law.  (And territories...and military bases....etc.)  There were some stipulations about where the card was bought AND where the card was used, if in different jurisdictions.  Many of the laws were contradictory.  In some cases, none of the money could be reclaimed, and would revert to different local funds.  There were effectively <i>endless</i> permutations.<p>She and her team had to decide what of all of this they would model with code.  They could not model all of it, so there was a hybrid of some actions being taken with the code, and the code outputting reports that humans would use to make decisions about actions.<p>It was eye opening to consider how legally complex many such &#x27;simple&#x27; things, like gift cards, are when implemented on a wide scale."
