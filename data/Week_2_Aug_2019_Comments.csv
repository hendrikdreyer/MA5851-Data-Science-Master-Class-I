"I don&#x27;t know if software developers are all that risk adverse. I mean we&#x27;re typically changing development environments and tools a lot, usually at a very high expense to change, with little evidence of time savings. Sometimes however those changes may feel like time savings or is just a cooler way to code. For example consider someone coding standard REST services vs adopting GraphQL. The adoption itself is a huge risk, probably exponential cost of introduction, probably a little more convenient code once that initial risk is taken on. Yet companies are adopting it like gangbusters. Similarly with React and a lot of other (Facebook) tech.<p>Ton&#x27;s of risk, arguably lots of reward, but doesn&#x27;t seem to be perfectly correlated with risk alone."

"Not sure I would call it hypersanity (as people said, it is a bit self-congratulatory), but I think it is closely related to the &quot;Jester&quot; archetype, which I kinda like (and hacker - probably Wizard in terms of archetypes - mentality is close to it).<p>The Jester is a free thinker, who ultimately doesn&#x27;t want to be encumbered by thinking about how his own thoughts or observations affect other people. In order to do that, he makes an implicit deal with the society. He rejects power or authority, and therefore, he is not going to be a threat for powers at be, whoever that is.<p>This can be made clear by, for example, wearing a funny costume all the time, therefore the image. In exchange for this postulated harmlessness, the Jester gains access to information and also ability to speak freely with powers at be. Of course the latter is also limited, his free speech cannot be used to undermine the authority, because then he would actually had a real power.<p>Therefore, Jester often uses non-serious, funny manner of speaking about things. Being laughed at by the unprivileged (while making witty and true observations) is a part of his strategy. It is also beneficial for the powerful (and sometimes part of the deal, in fact origin of the term &quot;court jester&quot;), because they get to pick his brain while not being threatened by him or his motives.<p>Some examples of Jesters in our society: John Oliver, John Stewart, Richard Feynman. But they are at every place (in programming, the most obvious celebrity examples are Erik Meijer and Steve Yegge). Look around, I am sure you will find people who are deliberate in attempt not to look too seriously, and you will probably have a Jester on your hands.<p>Some Jesters still decide to actually get power, but it is very risky, because the whole freethinking schtick relies on general belief that the Jester is harmless. (There is also an occasional literary trope where a Jester temporarily and discreetly uses his privilege to influence the world as a force of good.) These are, strictly speaking, not true to the archetype, they just mimic it, so let&#x27;s call them &quot;Mimes&quot;. A good example is Boris Johnson, who is consistently trying to look harmless, but in actuality is interested in power."
"Let&#x27;s talk about one specific thing from the article:<p>&gt;Things started to go awry when he first registered the tags. He tried typing in his license plate but the DMV website wouldn&#x27;t accept it.<p>Let&#x27;s talk about the fact that the DMV website wouldn&#x27;t accept it.  Do you think this is all right behavior on the part of the DMV website?<p>It&#x27;s really interesting because if you&#x27;re coding up the DMV web site, it makes sense to disallow NULL just as a preventative measure, like not allowing &#x27;-- in a query (to prevent SQL injection attacks.)<p>I would generally think that on the whole you should accept -- as a substring in a password.  But is it wrong programming if you don&#x27;t allow that substring?<p>Disallowing it could cause someone&#x27;s chosen password to fail, so they have to change it for you to accept the password they want, but if you know for sure that you use sql as part of processing passwords you might well decide that it is acceptable to make people have to try a new password before you&#x27;ll accept theirs, in case you are not confident that you are escaping everything correctly.<p>So from my end it seems okay to do something like disallow NULL.<p>If you consider the choice of the programmer on DMV&#x27;s web site, what do you think about their choice to reject this input, even though in fact it turned out to be legitimate?  Is it acceptable programming practice?"
"If you have a team you&#x27;re happy with and your cap table is not messed up, there is always a solution. See Slack, Youtube, Flickr and many others."
"Consider including screenshots!<p>A previous job had &quot;monthly&quot; ad hoc desk demos to show off whatever we were working on to our tech lead.  Since I can barely remember what I did yesterday if my life depended on it, this became a monthly &quot;crawl p4 history and summarize for myself to summarize for others&quot; routine.<p>And of course, it&#x27;s hard to demo when you&#x27;ve just broken your local checkout.  Or touched a common header and need an hour to finish recompiling the entire codebase.  And waiting around all day being conservative with my changes - or multiple days, in the event of delays or rescheduling - feels like wasted time.<p>Slap some screenshots, gifs, or video on an internal wiki and bam - even if you can&#x27;t demo in realtime because you broke something or are compiling, you can still demo.  And now you can share it with coworkers who want to build upon your work, use your tools, etc. as a very easy way to see exactly where you&#x27;ve hidden the new feature in whatever bespoke thing you&#x27;re doing!"
"Nicely done. Good to see an engineering blog acknowledging tech debt openly.<p>I&#x27;m with you all the way until the last paragraph which short-changed the conversation a bit. Quoting a few lines to respond below:<p>&gt;&gt; Build things to be easy to throw away and replace; it’ll make your code more modular.<p>One valid strategy to manage debt is to declare bankruptcy or amnesty on debt – that is throw away the code (because this code is no longer needed). In domains where this possible, definitely use it. But in most real-world touching software domains this is not likely possible.<p>&gt;&gt; Good tech debt has clear, well-known limitations. Document these in code comments, READMEs, FAQs, and conversations with the people who’d care.<p>Doing tech debt accounting in a more formal manner is required to intentionally take debt. In the locking example, it is a design debt (not just a code debt). If the debt isn&#x27;t document well and then it can become a ticking time bomb to be tripped by a clueless developer later."
"It brings this up in the article, but I have a very difficult time believing this isn&#x27;t just because rich countries have shifted manufacturing and mining to poor countries. Look at recycling. We all thought we were so environmentally aware by recycling, but turns out so much &quot;recycling&quot; was just &quot;ship to poor countries to deal with the fallout&quot;."
Articles like these make me wonder where these people find the qualified CTO replacements. To have confidence in a replacement you have to find someone with a pattern of success in similar roles and similar industries. You then have to take a gamble that they will perform at the same level with often a lot less motivation.

"The central theme of this article does not appear to be well supported by the data presented.  I interpret the scatter plot a bit differently they did:<p>1) The average amount of corporate borrowing as a share of total assets appears remarkably consistent over the last 66 years.<p>2) The average amount of capital expenditures as a share of total assets appears to be have been declining at a roughly consistent rate for 66 years.<p>3) The data does not appear to support any firm conclusions regarding changes to the correlation between capital expenditures and borrowing, which was the main topic of the article.  The slopes of those regression lines are highly suspect given the amount of data and the outliers in later years.  Certainly, there is nothing in the presented data suggesting a change over the last 17 years, much less the last 2 years.<p>It would have been nice to see some of the raw data or the statistical analysis, but clearly that is for a different audience than what they were targeting."

"I own a rare collector car with a three-digit VIN. This has caused endless hassles at the DMV as well as the insurance office.
Sometimes we find success by prepending the necessary number of zeros, before the VIN. Other instances in the same system require appending zeros after the VIN. The true VIN has a hyphen but that never makes it into the DMV&#x27;s system. One time I got stuck in a particularly nasty loop where the DMV mailed over thirty notices claiming the register would expire on 01&#x2F;01&#x2F;0000."

"A lot of history of the Amiga I was not aware of. I did not know they struggled so much in the US with the 500. I thought it was a success, and the struggles only came later after the 600, 1200, 4000, etc lost out to generic PCs.<p>Where I grew up in Norway, around 1990, everyone had or wanted an Amiga 500. Most of my mates had an Amiga, a few had a Nintendo NES. I did not know anyone who had an Atari ST.

They just keep churning out new similar projects with different features. All of the most commonly used Python packages are basically one-offs that use a bunch of other one-offs. This creates a cycle of reinventing the wheel and friction in ramping up on existing technology, due to all the extra integration work and split development, and later lift-and-shift into completely different dependencies that implement the same thing. PyPI is awash with duplicate abandoned one-offs to the point that just trying to just find a useful module to do what you want can take a long time."

"I like to read these things, because it feels so foreign to me. I started web dev around 2003 (stopped maybe 2010-2011), it involved a empty HTML file, perhaps only the few basic elements copied in, some hand crafted CSS, hand crafted JavaScript, a few ifs for Internet Explorers of the days, it was pretty manual, but one knew all the bits and pieces of the code.<p>Given how much I spent doing things this way, I&#x27;m quite reluctant to building JavaScript, let alone CSS (though preprocessing first came to CSS, if my mind serves me right).

I can&#x27;t filter my Files by file type, so it&#x27;s a mishmash of Word documents, OneNotes, Excel, Microsoft Project files, and PDFs. I can&#x27;t even filter by channel, or search within a specific channel.<p>2. Search results: Implement filters, as above, but add the ability to sort by anything other than Date Modified. Unless I know a good portion of the document name or it&#x27;s been modified recently, I&#x27;m forced to scroll through the list.<p>3. Skype integration: We already use Skype for Business. Why is Teams also reporting my missed Skype calls in addition to Outlook and Skype telling me the same?<p>4. Meetings: Is Outlook transitioning to an email-only client, or are we just going to have all functionality replicated across Teams&#x2F;Skype&#x2F;Outlook?<p>5. T-Bot: I&#x27;ve got this entity in my Chat sidebar; I guess it&#x27;s the Teams version of Slackbot? Anyway, it sits there saying &quot;What can I help you with today?&quot; Slackbot gives me an example question to begin interacting with it, but T-Bot has the entry window greyed out with the text &quot;Sending new messages to this bot has been disabled.&quot; It&#x27;s not clear whether that&#x27;s a Teams thing, or something my org did, but why is it even there if I can&#x27;t interact with it?<p>While we&#x27;re on Chat, there&#x27;s a bunch of people listed in here that I sent a couple one-off emails to. I talk to more people than this; where are those? Why aren&#x27;t they pulled from my Skype calls?<p>6. Calls: I see some contacts from one of my Skype groups, but it&#x27;s also got contacts who a) I&#x27;ve already removed from that list, and b) don&#x27;t even work at this company anymore. They&#x27;re still crowding out the people I actually interact with regularly.<p>7. API integrations: I&#x27;m not even sure where to begin. Teams uses the Microsoft Graph API, which requires use of the Azure portal, and if you&#x27;re already familiar with all that it might work for you. For the rest of us just trying to write a simple Python script integration (a la Slack webhook), it&#x27;s a bit much.<p>I&#x27;m sure I could think of more, but this non-blog-post is already long enough."

"Reading this thread [0] on their Uservoice shows that no progress has been done since August 2018 on notifications management for the end user. I&#x27;m sure they allow control when you create a channel but convincing the teammanager who very day pings the entire channel to say their work hours that day is impossible so that feature is more or less useless. 
The fact that you can praise coworkers with unicorns, being implemented before proper notifications, has made me go from believing in the future of Teams to now praising Slack.

"I&#x27;ll be interested to see how this pans out. I have significant hearing loss in both ears from infections as a baby, and the doctors always said it was because the hairs in my cochlea are dead.

"i was rooting for some weighty insight but was disappointed by a lack of perspective and coherence. the author writes at length about what yale, and the problem, isn&#x27;t and much less about about the consequences and potential avenues to shape them. she seems to lack enough life experience to put her critiques into a wider context that&#x27;s relevant much beyond yale. for instance, the ivy league is viewed through the lens of 3 schools: harvard, yale and princeton, which suggests she&#x27;s wholly internalized the elitist tunnel vision she decries and can&#x27;t see beyond.<p>as far as i can tell, she&#x27;s saying administrators, students and faculty are at odds, particularly around what it means to have privilege and how to properly account for it (resulting in deadlock &amp; status quo). beyond that, it&#x27;s hard to tell.<p>despite the harsh critique, i&#x27;m interested to see where this goes. more research and exploratory writing on the subject should help, as she clearly has something she wants to say."

"Reading this article made me think of many of the boss encounters in the first Destiny. Levels were usually a long, multi part corridor for the first half and a bullet sponge boss at the end. Many of the boss arenas were poorly designed with so many spawn points that most cover was nearly ineffective. So the optimal game play was to stand in the entry way, funnel trash mobs into the entry and kill them, go out and shot the boss for a bit until the next wave of trash spawned, retreat to the entrance and repeat. They did get better with design and started dropping you into arenas to remove the doorway.<p>I think the designers did fill the arenas with these mechanics to make them interesting. But so many of the main objectives included a bullet sponge enemy, that while you were addressing the objective new trash mobs would spawn in unpredictable places, and usually more than one wave would spawn during the objective. This made most of the cover feel worthless. Instead it was just as viable to fly around with you jet pack or super jump, keep moving, and hope to dodge random enemy fire."

Parts of this could have come from a script to generate these.<p>In particular the bit about how some elderly academic was a liberal, and therefore anyone who disagreed with them must be some dangerous extremist.<p>Always seems more likely that as a youth they would have been similarly distant from a &quot;reasonable&quot; moderate of a similar age.<p>A couple of years ago the big trope was that this this was the new face of fascist authoritarianism, that republicans were reasonable moderates and people trying to push veganism, or fight climate change or whatever were crazy extremists. The rise of Trump seems to have muted that a little and rendered most of it ridiculous in hindsight. (Well, it was ridiculous at the time too, but got carried by the same media that would then support Trump)."

"I agree that in general statistics is more concerned about inference, while machine learning focuses on prediction. 
On the other hand, there is such a huge overlap between the fields that it is hard to make a distinction.
Also there are statistical fields which focus more on prediction the same way as ML does.
For example, in geostatistics prediction is often the only goal, e.g. to predict heavy metal concentration across a domain. People accept that it is impossible to explain every bit of spatial variation and just model it by a gaussian process (the same gaussian process used in ML)."
"I&#x27;ve noticed that Google search results prioritize reputation above search matching.

"This story resonates. A few years back I was dealing with mild pain while coding. I stupidly ignored it for months as it got significantly worse, to the point where it became impossible to type for extended periods.<p>I tried lots of things. My doctor did a nerve conduction study, which apparently ruled out carpal  tunnel syndrome, but he wasn&#x27;t much help beyond that. He gave me some straps that I slept in and wore around to keep my wrists immobilized. I did some physical therapy. I got a split keyboard and ergonomic mouse. I even took a month off from typing, then returned, but the pain was worse than ever.<p>The double whammy of severe pain combined with the fear that you&#x27;ll never code again is rough to say the least.<p>I resolved to just code with my voice. I never found Talon but found VoiceCode instead. It also relied on Dragon&#x27;s NaturallySpeaking software, which I was dismayed to learn was still the best desktop software out there. My hopes and ambition for what VoiceCode could do always outpaced reality, but it was workable. I remember impressing some friends who witnessed me quickly and accurately writing code by speaking what seemed like gibberish.<p>As the author notes, the biggest problem quickly becomes that your voice tires out. You&#x27;re not built to talk nonstop for hours on end every day. I was forced to become a much more efficient developer for a bit.<p>Eventually the pain began to subside. I remember when I first noticed it happening, because it was one of the happiest moments of my life. After a little experimentation and observation, it was clear that my recovery was positively correlated with consistency in going to the gym for heavy weightlifting sessions. Even today, pain in my hands and wrists is a reliable signal that I haven&#x27;t been lifting in recent weeks, and when I start back, the pain goes away."

"I bet we&#x27;ve all experienced the bit in a movie or TV show where they&#x27;re portraying your job and go, &quot;It&#x27;s not even slightly like that.&quot; I bet everybody in every profession gets that.

If the story has to go through a moment like that, get a better story.<p>I appreciate that Radcliffe is here mimicking some of the dull, prosaic work.

"This is all very interesting and amazing, and kudos to the person for being able to do this - but I think we need to take a step back here a bit; this doesn&#x27;t look like something that &quot;just anybody&quot; could replicate.<p>For one, this person seems to have some very advanced knowledge of some very advanced processes - I am not even sure where one would gain such knowledge from easily, though they do seem to have access to MIT in some manner. Regardless of how it was gained, this knowledge of some of the very basic processes and advanced tools involved would be foundational to this entire enterprise (and it seems this person went to the trouble to build up to this - but what foundation of knowledge they had prior to that point seem unknown?).<p>Secondly, they appear to have something more than just a simple &quot;2-car garage&quot; - unless the camera perspective is really skewed. The building they are in looks to be like a large steel fabricated unit, 40&#x27;x 20&#x27;x 12&#x27; - my numbers might be off but it doesn&#x27;t look like a simple garage or workshop, but rather something you&#x27;d either pay a lot of money for to have erected on your (likely sizeable) property, or its space at a leased business&#x2F;industrial complex.<p>Third, from what I gather, much of their equipment is resold industrial surplus off ebay (and probably other places); I know of one company, local to me (Phoenix), which sells online via ebay such equipment (Equipment Exchange) - assuming they are still in business. While what they sold was inexpensive - even at &quot;pennies on the dollar&quot; you are not talking small amounts of money, because some of that equipment is anything but inexpensive brand-new. I&#x27;m sure there are other vendors as well for this kind of equipment, and if you know what you want and need, you can probably strike some good bargains, but I still can&#x27;t imagine this being budget friendly for most people.<p>This all adds up to what seems to be a &quot;hobby&quot; that would require both extreme dedication (time, energy, and knowledge acquisition) and considerable monetary resources to implement. Not something that just anyone can do - it&#x27;s not a &quot;maker friendly&quot; endeavour. Maybe it can be miniaturized and simplified now that it&#x27;s been &quot;proven&quot; to be possible, which is a great thing in itself (after all, it was more or less done with 3D printing and home CNC). Though I am not sure how far that can be taken - then again, people have fabricated some quite complex stuff before...<p>So all in all - this is amazing work, and does show the possibility. But temper that with the reality of the situation: This person has some very specialized knowledge gathered over who knows what kind of timeframe, and the resources to purchase and bring together all of these tools and parts to do this kind of thing. Even with all that, they still had and have a bunch of trial and error. I&#x27;m amazed it could be done at all in a nominally &quot;DIY&quot; manner. Congratulations to that!"

"For a long time our culture seemed to produce honest people doing work for an honest wage. They would be reluctant to &quot;charge more than it&#x27;s worth&quot;. There was an element of honor to it, and avoiding the shameful act of gouging your customer. If something takes 2 days to do, and it costs you $30&#x2F;day to live, then you charge, say $120 - you&#x27;re not only living, but also you&#x27;re saving for a rainy day. It&#x27;s a good thing.<p>Cynical market manipulation has soaked into real world work at every level both public and private. Sociopaths with the balls to ask 10x or 100x the traditional, cost based price have succeeded totally, and have lured workers with 2x or 5x wages, essentially starving any potentially honest competition. It stuffs all the good workers into a profit-maximizing corporation that now has a lot of other priorities that often conflict with &quot;an honest days work for honest pay&quot;.<p>The city politicians and admins responsible for actually spending the peoples money are often unable and&#x2F;or unwilling to actually take responsibility for the projects. Partly this is the moral hazard of spending other people&#x27;s money; but partly it&#x27;s passing the buck, not wanting to take on any risk associated with real project execution. The public&#x27;s awareness is dim and short-lived, so the upside of project success isn&#x27;t worth the risk. So you hire a firm to hire the firm to do the project, and you have plenty of scapegoats if things go sideways.<p>I don&#x27;t think successful projects can just happen. You need individuals, visibly, identifiably, running projects, and building reputations. I think it&#x27;s wrong for a small town&#x27;s admins to throw money at a big corp to do an infrastructure project, and pay themselves 6-figure salaries to &quot;oversee&quot; it for 10 years, &quot;darn those overruns!&quot; In fact, I think it would be great if infra project competence was second only to running a self-restrained police force as a topic of city elections (the distant third being capability in running other city services well).<p>But from what I&#x27;ve seen American voters only show up if they have strong emotions, and don&#x27;t know anything about government or the people running to rule them. So, this is what you get."
"For anyone in a similar boat who can&#x27;t get their doctor to take them seriously, ask for a referral to physical therapy. Doctors don&#x27;t push back on that because it&#x27;s not &quot;drug seeking,&quot; and PTs and physiatrists are much more qualified to handle these types of issues than regular MDs. I started having this issue when my EDS led to Thoracic Outlet Syndrome, which caused nerve pain down my hands, and only exercises to release the entrapped nerve in my shoulders helped."

Uber emerged into the market as a disruptor in the absolute worst sense of the world - it was challenging an entrenched industry with low efficiency (cab companies make ungodly amounts of money in some markets) but it did so by playing by a different set of rules - skirting both the disingenuous regulations put in to protect cab companies&#x27; profit and those in place for the safety of the general public.  Even disregarding all of the legion HR issues at that company their business model depended on not playing fair and they&#x27;re paying for it.<p>I like to compare them to the car sharing companies (like zipcar&#x2F;car2go etc...) which managed to de-throne the entrenched rental agencies without going out of their way to break laws.

"Since we are talking about “useful approximations”, one I have always found useful in robotics is doubling m&#x2F;s to get miles per hour. While a bit “rough” usually “good enough” for when thinking about normal driving speeds. Here are some examples:<p><pre><code>    1 m&#x2F;s ~ 2 mph (2.2 mph)
    5 m&#x2F;s ~ 10 mph (11.2 mph)
    10 m&#x2F;s ~ 20 mph (22.4 mph)
    20 m&#x2F;s ~ 40 mph (44.7 mph)
    30 m&#x2F;s ~ 60 mph (67.1 mph)
</code></pre>
You could argue that it is a very rough estimation, but I find that most times you are just trying to get a “rough speed” when doing this conversion anyway."

"Distractions are our lives now. You can choose to minimize them. Start by turning off “new email” notifications. You may not miss much by not knowing the <i>moment</i> an email arrives. If something is truly important and urgent, they will usually use multiple means to contact you, like calling you.<p>You can also graduate to removing almost all notifications from your phone. I say almost all because the beauty of Slack is that it never differentiated between being mobile or at a desktop (like Skype did) so you might need notifications from your work Slack to appear if you are not really present. Also, get rid of non-work Slacks on your phone, if you spend too much time on Slack on your phone, it could help eliminate more potential distractions.<p>The next level is to remove all native applications for anything that you think might distract you. It is much, much harder to fall into the rabbit hole of infinite scroll type binging with a mobile web experience.

"$1700 seems like an awful lot to spend on this setup, even with 1yr warranty. I recently bought the following from eBay on a £500 budget:<p>Asrock Rack c602 mobo
2x Xeon e3-2650Lv2 (20c&#x2F;40t)
8x8GB Samsung DDR3 ECC
generic EATX case with fans
2x CPU heatsinks
3x case fans
XFX fanless modular PSU<p>if the price and specs alone aren&#x27;t compelling enough:
it runs idle at ~50w
it has a similar passmark of &gt;15000
it has 4x GbE ports
it has 4x PCIE3 slots (!)<p>I&#x27;d never heard of iLO, which other commenters mention as a selling point, but a quick search leads me to believe this is HP&#x27;s take on IPMI, which this mobo has.<p>originally built as an HTPC server, I had 2 main criteria for my build: cool and quiet. hence opting for low powered processor versions, 0db PSU and PWM case fans. if you don&#x27;t require these criteria you can knock ~20% off the budget.<p>there was so much power being unused that I binned a few other devices (namely crappy ISP-provided router and tv box) and made this build the heart of my home network. it is now my family&#x27;s router, firewall, adBlocker, movie and tv server, game server, free cloud storage manager (synced to every household device), OS updates cache, music streamer, torrent client&#x2F;server, VM server, web server, database server, VPN client, proxy server, etc., the list is virtually endless. these are all run simultaneously with ample resources leftover for frequent workstation usage.<p>I should admit that I thoroughly researched every component&#x27;s specifications and price, and as such it took me around 3 months of waiting to source them.<p>I also admit this use case and learning curve is not for everyone, but it was ultimately a rewarding experience for both my brain and wallet."

"Disclosure: Microsoft employee. Using a throwaway. Satya, please don&#x27;t track me down and fire me.<p>I&#x27;ve never agreed so heavily with a headline and disagreed so vehemently with the actual content. Some of this is right, but a big chunk is wrong and I think misses some of the most egregious horrors of Teams.<p>I used Slack professionally before in a fairly large org (&gt;200).<p>Two things the author got wrong:<p>First - things the author got wrong. Notifications are absolutely configurable by Channel - at least with the bits I&#x27;m on and how the internal Microsoft tenant is configured.<p>Second, a huge portion of the things mentioned by the author are config switches that apparently his tenant admins decided to muck with (auto-adding to Teams, no outsiders, etc).<p>The biggest complaint I have about this piece is it doesn&#x27;t actually talk about some of the real, most egregious parts about Teams:
Teams has atrocious search, performance (functionally and by footprint,  and UI - which the author covered. 
On top of that, it seems clear that the Teams team didn&#x27;t have a coherent vision for the user&#x2F;grouping model, so channels are kinda treated like groups but so are channels? For instance, <i>you can mention a channel from another channel</i>. Wtf. This drives me insane on a daily basis.<p>The development story is a mess. Not going into details here but if folks in the comments care to peruse the docs, I&#x27;d love to hear other folks&#x27; perspective.<p>Other random complaints:<p>- The emoji story is hilarious. There&#x27;s a taskbar thing called &quot;emoji&quot; which are animated stickers (some of which are actually fantastic) but definitely aren&#x27;t emoji. You used to be able to shortcode emoji (ie :smile:) and get a thing that looked like an emoji but <i>still wasn&#x27;t unicode emoji. AND you could use the actually emoji keyboard on your device to actually type unicode. So, 3 ways to get 3 separate sets of glyphs, all referred to as &quot;emoji&quot;. Yes, I know this complaint is dumb but it shows a weird lack of attention to detail.<p>- The formatting story is the union of every formatting concept ever. Quasi-markdown is supported inline, but its essentially an editor trick that triggers (what I assume is) richtext formatting.<p>- This is ANOTHER thing trying to be </i>the* dashboard in Microsoft&#x27;s product suite. There are like... 7. PowerBI, Azure Devops, SharePoint... Teams... I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m forgetting some.  Which leads me to...<p>- It was clear from early development that leadership wasn&#x27;t fixated on &quot;do one thing well&quot; and were trying to be the sum of all productivity goals. The result is chat sucks, feels halfassed and there&#x27;s a lot of stapled on shit that makes the experience gross.<p>There are a lot of smart people on this team but the folks at the helm set things on a terrible course that misses the fundamentals, which is super depressing.<p>As an aside, one thing I&#x27;m genuinely curious about from folks that use Slack in very large orgs (&gt;500), how does Slack&#x27;s usability scale?"

"I actually wrote a thingo on this recently. Modern front end has essentially the exact same challenges as a server which provides its API with sockets&#x2F;websockets&#x2F;events.<p>A back end server with this configuration would have a handler layer for IO, business logic layer and data layer.<p>DI and IoC ensures that the IO layer doesn&#x27;t know about the data layer as the logic layer takes it as a dependency. The IO layer consumes the logic layer and the logic layer doesn&#x27;t care&#x2F;know about that.<p>Front end is <i>exactly</i> like this. The data source is REST rather than a database. The UI layer is an event source and consumer. The logic layer notifies its consumers (the UI layer) that there has been a change. The rendering library doesn&#x27;t matter, it&#x27;s just a mechanism to represent the events it consumes.<p>The problem in front end is there has been no rational mechanism for DI in the libraries. React relied on the service locator pattern to deliver dependencies so to ensure quality decoupling you would need to have wrapped your components with a million functions.<p>```
withTheme(withUsers(withSomethingElse(withAnotherThing(Component))
```<p>So rather than that, just use a single &quot;service&quot;, redux, and forget about DI. Everything can do anything and all your logic is done inside that one thing.<p>Angular is no better. While they have a nice DI solution, it still relies on concrete implementations rather than abstractions. So your business logic must live within &quot;angular services&quot; and can not simply be &quot;javascript&quot; consumed by a rendering library.<p>Vue just missed the point entirely.<p>React context packaged this problem in an ergonomic box and, in my opinion, is a fantastic solution given the constraints. However at this point, the meta in front end programming is so irrational that it boggles my mind.<p>In the following example, you can see that I have an application which uses React as a renderer. React consumes a package from &#x2F;platform. The package has no relationship to the presentational layer.<p>I could run the units in the package inside node or the browser console and it wouldn&#x27;t care about its rendering library. The &quot;PostStore&quot; class exposes an API which consists of a getter and a stream. React consumes the stream, because it needs to be notified on changes.<p><a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackblitz.com&#x2F;edit&#x2F;react-ts-biohay?file=gui%2Fapp.tsx"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackblitz.com&#x2F;edit&#x2F;react-ts-biohay?file=gui%2Fapp.t...</a><p>Conversely, this loose coupling means that the view renderer is a small portion of the application. I could swap it out for another renderer. Preact, Svelte, whatever.<p>Front end is a mess."

"I think for newbies there are two separate aspects to explain: first an intro to algebraic structures perhaps using groups as an example, then monads in particular.<p>It’s important to emphasize that algebraic structures are abstractions or “interfaces” that let you reason with a small set of axioms, like proving stuff about all groups and writing functions polymorphic for all monads.<p>With monads in particular I think the pure&#x2F;map&#x2F;join presentation is great. First explain taking “a” to “m a” and “a -&gt; b” to “m a -&gt; m b” and then “m (m a)” to “m a”. The examples of IO, Maybe, and [a] are great.<p>You can also mention how JavaScript promises don’t work as monads because they have an implicit join semantics as a practical compromise."

"&gt; Neither Heisenberg&#x27;s uncertainty principle nor Bell&#x27;s inequality exclude the possibility, however small, that the Universe, including all observers inhabiting it, is in principle computable by a completely deterministic computer program...<p>Either I&#x27;m confused (definitely possible) or this is sort of implicitly equivocating between two different senses of &quot;determinism&quot;. There are experiments we can perform that appear to demonstrate quantum randomness. Though it may sound superficially plausible that any particular such random outcome is actually the deterministic output of a hidden pseudorandom number generator, that hypothesis <i>is</i> ruled out by Bell&#x27;s theorem.<p>What Bell&#x27;s theorem <i>can&#x27;t</i> rule out is the hypothesis that not only any individual quantum measurement, but the sum total of everything that happens in the universe including the experimenters&#x27; choices of what actions to take during the experiment, is all part of a single deterministic causal path for the whole universe, that just so happens to play out in such a way that we never see anything that visibly contradicts Bell&#x27;s theorem. This can&#x27;t really be empirically falsified, but there are various philosophy-of-science reasons to be a priori skeptical of it (depending on which philosophers of science you ask, of course)."

"There’s also something the Chinese state calls “fusion centres” which is one of the most interesting facets of this intelligence-industrial complex in China.<p>Essentially the state decides, let’s say high tech cutting edge batteries for storing renewable energy is where they want to invest in.

They then have state representatives who effectively ask “what do we need to know” and “who are the major players in the field.<p>In a month or so they come back again.

Suddenly all the Chinese companies in the space start delivering R&amp;D and eventually products that match some of the best stuff being done in the space.

"&gt; An important item here, as well as in the future, is to deal on a CASH basis. You MUST NOT borrow to pay later.

Starting a business on a cash-only basis is possible and arguably safer than borrowing, but it&#x27;s very slow going.<p>The way most farmers get started is they take out a great stonkin&#x27; loan from the bank ($10mil+) and buy land, stock, machinery etc. They then run their newly established farm and try to turn enough of a profit to pay the interest plus a bit of capital.<p>That&#x27;s why farmers tend to be &quot;asset rich and cash poor&quot; for the first 20-30 years and then (if they&#x27;re both diligent and lucky) are suddenly super wealthy once they&#x27;ve paid their loans off.<p>(Source: dairy-farming relatives)"

"Recently I&#x27;ve taken up metal machining as a semi-serious hobby.  Fully automated CNC machines don&#x27;t entirely fit my use-cases but for a couple of them LinuxCNC works fine.

"&gt; If we made the assembly of steel, concrete, and asphalt cheaper, do you think suburban mayors would stop demanding we build them big box interchanges?<p>I generally agree with many of Strong Towns&#x27; arguments, but this really seems to miss the mark.  The reason why major infrastructure projects like regional&#x2F;urban rail systems, tunnels, etc are so expensive vs other <i>developed</i> countries isn&#x27;t due to the cost of commodities like concrete or steel.<p>It&#x27;s due to the lack of sufficient domestic expertise in designing, managing, and building such large scale works.<p>Because we don&#x27;t build that scale of project frequently in the US, when we do it, we don&#x27;t do it as efficiently.  A recent example would be the use of the incorrect grade of steel in San Francisco&#x27;s new Chinatown subway line.<p>OTOH, we have huge amounts of experience building big box stores,  parking lots, and freeways, which are the sort of infrastructure that  the Strong Towns perspective says (correctly IMO) that we don&#x27;t need so much of.<p>We need to build infrastructure with higher utilization, which therefore doesn&#x27;t need to rely on what Strong Towns describes as the Growth Ponzi Scheme, but unfortunately that&#x27;s exactly the sort of infrastructure that we are not very good at building."
"I think the author is ascribing too much intent to a simple economy of shame that’s omnipresent in all classes; if people find out you have more than they do, they hate you.<p>The author herself appears to be biased by this.  She believes that the “rich elites” have a great burden of responsibility towards the world, which she justifies with shaky zero sum logic that suggests that because they have more, they necessarily took it from those who have less (her bulky villager metaphor).  She might not be openly jealous, but she still seems to believe that her rich peers must somehow earn this wealth (an undefined and likely impossible undertaking), and writes about them with condescension when she sees they do not meet her burden.<p>The kind of “rich elite” that attends Yale—that is to say a child who has access to vast sums of wealth they themselves did not amass—is an otherwise normal person who simply wants to live a happy life.  Some end up president, some end up “gypsies”, but as the observes all of them have learned that in order to pursue these goals unmolested they have to put on the cloak of being less privileged than those around them.

"I liked the original Doom and Doom II back in the day.  But it seems that I played them differently than other people, since both the 2016 Doom, and the advice given in this article, eliminates my style of game play <i>entirely</i>.  I never played much of the 2016 Doom game as a result – it just wasn’t fun for me.  I can certainly accept that it deserved the acclaim it got, since it allowed the gameplay which other people experienced with the original Doom.  But not my gameplay style.<p>The article talks about “<i>If I want my friend to fight in the arena</i>” and gives “<i>One way path, with the drop down</i>” as one possible solution.  I absolutely abhor arena fights, especially with auto-closing doors or a drop down.  I would always try to trigger as few enemies as possible, and would always retreat to fight them safely if possible.  Why would you design levels which makes it impossible to play in this style, if some people prefer it?  Why would you design a level to force a specific play style, even though they might not enjoy it?"

"@1: One could also have automated tests instead of scaffolding.<p>@2: Sure, but this it not really technical debt. It is the wise policy of not immediately writing code for the most general case.

The thing is that the thing you call an edge case might have the more proper name of &#x27;bug&#x27;. If you deliberately leave in bugs at the time of writing the code it can lead to very difficult to estimate &#x27;stabilization time&#x27; at the point where the code is supposed to go into production but is not quite reliable enough.

SAR insurance cover is also available locally but is probably much cheaper if it is arranged through one’s own insurance company or bank.<p>Source: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.noonsite.com&#x2F;place&#x2F;norway&#x2F;svalbard-spitsbergen&#x2F;longyearbyen&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.noonsite.com&#x2F;place&#x2F;norway&#x2F;svalbard-spitsbergen&#x2F;l...</a>"

"Reminder:  Way back when the AT&amp;T &#x27;secret rooms&#x27; that enabled the NSA to tap all traffic were revealed, we learned that the NSA relies heavily upon an extremely questionable legal opinion written by their own lawyers which says that communications do not count as &#x27;collected&#x27; or &#x27;intercepted&#x27; until a HUMAN operator reads the plaintext.  That means no amount of automated processing, machine learning, statistical analysis, filtering, profiling, etc run on your communications or its metadata amounts to your communications being &#x27;intercepted&#x27; as far as they are concerned.  They know this legal opinion is dicey, and they will do absolutely anything, including dropping cases entirely, to avoid having it tested in court."

I think the idea is useful for large groups however a simple &quot;cool down period&quot; is far too simple. Something like &quot;10 messages an hour&quot; would be far more useful I think as you can still have quick and efficient exchanges while preventing the ability for any single user to be dominant.<p>However even that is too simple. You would need to pair it with good UX so users aren&#x27;t stuck without messages when someone is asking them a question.

"I’ve thought about this a bit.  I don’t have anger issues but I have anxiety issues and I spent decades not understanding that I experienced anxiety.  
In my experience, the culture tells men to exhibit strength and show no weakness. What counts as strength&#x2F;weakness has changed over time and varies depending on your social groups — it’s not just the stuff associated with typically masculine values, but it also shows up in coding skills, or parenting skills, or how much work one takes on in those or other domains without complaint. 
In Behave by Robert Sapolsky, it’s repeatedly observed that  testosterone doesn’t necessarily amplify aggression, but it does drive status-seeking&#x2F;maintaining behavior, where status is some set of collective values where one member can have more or less of it than another and be seen as above or below the other. To me, this maps very well to generalized sense of strength or weakness.<p>So, in my opinion, men are both wired and trained by the culture to avoid admitting anxiety, to themselves and others, because it is a weakness."
Sweet idea! Looking forward to trying this out.
"The main difference is not in techniques, but in goals. The primary goal of statistics is to help a human make an informed decision by quantifying uncertainty.

As long as it gets the &quot;right&quot; answer, the explanations to humans are not as important."

"I think you missed a solution, which is a variant of #2.<p>To simplify things, consider a single global chat room, on an enormous server (probably in Salt Lake City), where every person on earth is connected and have a public&#x2F;private key-pair, and every person on Earth can read everything anyone posts. You can post publicly ( anonymously or with a signature), or privately (pair key) to any individual on Earth. From this starting point, how do you make private group chats? (This starting point factors out a lot things we shouldn&#x27;t worry about, and I think is simpler&#x2F;nicer than a story about a Slack admin).<p>Your solution #1, pairwise encryption, clearly doesn&#x27;t scale for the sender (as you point out). It is also aesthetically displeasing.<p>I feel like your solution #2, though, isn&#x27;t what I would do, and I&#x27;m honestly surprised that&#x27;s how WhatsApp, etc. works.<p>My first thought is that a person who wants a shared room creates a (symmetric) key K for the room, and then distributes K to all invited participants privately. To remove a user you generate a new K for the room, and send it to N-1 participants. They all agree to post using the new K (and a signature).<p>I don&#x27;t see a performance issue with this solution. Consider that <i>every</i> message to the &quot;room&quot; causes O(N) fanout. If the rate of &quot;normal&quot; message addition is <i>much less</i> than the rate of participant addition&#x2F;subtraction, well, that&#x27;s performant enough. (Especially considering a new key for the room is some relatively small fixed size.)<p>(In a situation where you have a huge, passive audience and a single emitter, then yes my proposal will generate a lot of extra unnecessary traffic as people enter or leave. However, I&#x27;d argue that communication like this is probably better secured through more traditional centrally controlled means, e.g. a server process with ordinary user accounts that have a connection status.)<p>EDIT: There <i>is</i> a coordination problem with my solution, in that you can&#x27;t guarantee members will use the new K; it might be useful to have a bot or something remind anyone who posts using the old K to use the new one instead."
Good discussion. Buybacks are also investments. The problem is that all the low interest printed money and tax breaks are circulating among the same people&#x2F;families that own assets in the first place.<p>The trickle down isn&#x27;t happening because every single printed dollar and every single tax break is making more money circulate among the rich&#x2F;asset owners.<p>That&#x27;s also the reason yields are low. That&#x27;s also the reason Softbank can raise so much. That&#x27;s also the reason nurses and teachers and firefighters and factory workers aren&#x27;t making enough.

"My main frustration with Teams are:<p>- Caching + searching : Their caching and searching is just terrible. It&#x27;s surprising how hard it is to search older messages especially in a private group chat. scrolling up takes a long time. Images don&#x27;t show up in the desktop app, so I have to open web app all the time.<p>- Centralized control: I agree that Teams is designed for centralized control. some of it might be good, but its a communation software, and telling people how to communicate seems like it&#x27;d defeat the purpose.<p>- Not being able to add External people: Agree with the OP, this is a pain. People in my org did this well with slack, but once we were asked to move to teams, we weren&#x27;t collaborating with external folks the same way.<p>- Chat and Teams are two different windows. WHen I am in private chat area, I never see new messages in Teams area. Notifications for chat work fine when I am in teams area.<p>- Threading: I think threading is poorly implemented, since it collapses the thread when you reopen the app.<p>I feel like it would be an excellent improvement over email if this came out before slack. But slack has shown what a good chat software can do, and teams falls short in many ways."

"What I find baffling is that almost every program I&#x27;m interested in as a creative power user has a Python API for scripting, from type and graphic design to 3D modeling, rendering and music making.<p>I&#x27;m a bit into web design&#x2F;frontend as well, and was thinking about either learning JS and Node more deeply, or add some other &quot;backend language&quot; like PHP or Ruby, and learn their frameworks like Laravel or Rails.<p>Should I pick Python, Django or Flask instead to cross the gap to my creative hobbies?"

"The stuff about doctors in the UK is quite amusing.<p>I actually look after a relative who has similar but not identical issue. Like OP, the diagnosis is madness and advice to see a clinical psychologist (ironically, this person was a psychologist themselves). Like OP, the doctor is actually actively intervening to prevent a second opinion from a neurologist (which is slightly redundant as the conclusion will most likely be the same...although sometimes you get lucky).<p>In what is probably not a massive coincidence, my relative probably saw the same people as OP (I live in the Edinburgh area). This unit got handed a massive stack of cash recently...BMWs all round for the boys.<p>Recently, as my relative&#x27;s condition has deteriorated, I think about this a lot (they are basically a parent to me).<p>Doctors in the UK are, by and large, arrogant. If you want to know if someone is a doctor in the UK, talk to them...they will tell you within the first ten seconds...multiple times. Most outside primary care seem to actively dislike patients. I know multiple people who became doctors...none did anything for anyone but themselves (amazing given that almost everyone at my school was strongly encouraged to do charity work). I went to a university with a huge, well-regarded medical school...nothing that I experienced at university altered this view. There is something fundamentally, one could even say psychologically, wrong with the kind of person who becomes a doctor in the UK.<p>But there is also something utterly wrong with the incentives: the NHS has no capacity for care outside a narrow boundary. They have &quot;policy&quot; in areas where this makes no sense. In this area, there is a clear medical consensus that these issues aren&#x27;t psychological...outside the UK. Inside, there is &quot;policy&quot;...if you have any of these problems (fibro&#x2F;CFS&#x2F;ME) you are mad. Say what you will about the US healthcare system but in these cases, i.e. infrequent, then you actually get a decent result, doctors are paying attention to research, and they are actually willing to consider the possibility that you aren&#x27;t &quot;putting it on&quot;.<p>The only exception is MS...unf, as it is often clear where the boundary lies between MS and some of the other things in this group, this is a largely redundant distinction to everyone but the doctors."

"&quot;DevOps&quot; used to be a methodology where a Dev and an Ops share a same goal of delivering value into production, at least, that&#x27;s in the book I have read.<p>A sort of extension of the Lean System where workers from different areas share a common goal of delivering value to the final customer (in production), the same card may require a backend dev, frontend dev, and an ops to share the goal to take this card from idea to production, and then monitoring how it behaves in production.<p>For people who have not read the same books, &quot;DevOps&quot; mean things like &quot;applying dev method in the operation field&quot; ie. with ansible and the likes, coding the infra. After all, that&#x27;s what that word seems to mean at first glance.<p>This reminds me of the term full-stack, some people consider it&#x27;s just about being good at both frontend and backend, in my opinion a good full-stack is also a good networking engineer as well as good at customer acquisition.<p>For best ROI:<p>- integration must be automated and continuous<p>- delivery must be automated and continuous<p>- tech debt includes untested code and being late in dependency versions<p>- the above should be treated as impediments<p>The purpose of &quot;DevOps&quot; being to deliver faster from idea to production, it does necessarily include a toolchain of CI&#x2F;CD&#x2F;IaaS &amp; monitoring tools. From this &quot;DevOps toolchain&quot;, taylorists opened positions for developers that can maintain it around a software, they called that position &quot;DevOps&quot;, which explains how we got there on having different meanings for the same word.<p>I highly recommend  &quot;Continuous Delivery &amp; DevOps: QuickStart&quot; by Paul Swartout for a first quick read on the matter."

I typically use <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;basscss.com&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;basscss.com&#x2F;</a>, but been meaning to checkout larger Atomic CSS frameworks like Tailwind and Tachyons.<p>Aside from the benefits of &quot;functional CSS&quot; that others have mentioned, one thing I really love about it is I don&#x27;t have to constantly be looking up CSS rules or properties; I just reference the docs of whatever framework I&#x27;m using to get what I want. You might say I could do this with Bootstrap as well -- and yeah, I can, but I much prefer the piece-meal approach of atomic CSS. The times I&#x27;ve used Bootstrap, I found myself fighting their styles constantly, or giving up and resulting with a site that looks like every other Bootstrap page."
"Despite the other comments, this is a very serious issue. In fact, it&#x27;s one of the most serious that can affect an aircraft, and the serial numbers involved are really grounded until inspected (8 hours) or fixed (1-2 months - ie. rebuilt wing.)<p>Smaller airplanes work around this by having a &quot;massive spar&quot; with no joints that goes entirely through the fuselage.<p>In the case of larger planes a &quot;center wing box&quot; can be used, like the newer C-130 serial numbers that are not affected.<p>Source: commercially-rated airplane pilot who&#x27;s familiar with military jet design."

"Capital has been cheap for some time now, since the economic crash in 2008. It has only been since ~2016 that the Federal Funds Rate has lifted above half a percent [0]. And although the rates have recently been increased (Rate recently fell 1&#x2F;4 of a percent but is still just above 2%), we are still seeing very low rates. Because capital has been relatively easy to acquire for this time I wonder if this is a more a consequence of the obvious but high cost investments already drying up.<p>Executives have always wanted to drive up metrics as it allows them to move forward in their work, so I would find it doubtful that they wouldn&#x27;t want to build out their business further if they are able to (More sales is a sure way to make more profits in most cases). If the capital is there, and we know it is, then these business must not see enough demand to expand.<p>Many would say that buy-backs are a result of a company having excess capital and no sure investments [1]. With the us inflation rate hovering between 1.5 and 3 percent [2], a loan at ~2.25 percent is close to free money.<p>I personally worry for the economy because of buy-backs. Not because I believe there is anything wrong with the practice, but because I think it indicates that business is general not going well enough to invest back into it.<p>-0, <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tradingeconomics.com&#x2F;united-states&#x2F;interest-rate"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tradingeconomics.com&#x2F;united-states&#x2F;interest-rate</a><p>-1, <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.investopedia.com&#x2F;ask&#x2F;answers&#x2F;040815&#x2F;what-situations-does-it-benefit-company-buy-back-outstanding-shares.asp"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.investopedia.com&#x2F;ask&#x2F;answers&#x2F;040815&#x2F;what-situati...</a><p>-2, <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.usinflationcalculator.com&#x2F;inflation&#x2F;current-inflation-rates&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.usinflationcalculator.com&#x2F;inflation&#x2F;current-infl...</a>"
"I think this points out the elephant in the room: why are so many people in supposedly high income cities not able to buy properties? This is an issue that needs to be solved hand in hand with pollution: less travel, less need for a car, and more living outside overcrowded cities means more living space. So how can we move more jobs to suburbs, where people can work at nearby or home locations and can afford more living space? I seriously struggle understanding why at least tech jobs are so centered around crowded cities, when these could really be located in tech clusters or tech cities on the outskirts."
"The automation of this is great and saves time and money.<p>But this highlights the exact problem that Andrew Yang, the Democratic Candidate is highlighting which is: what do we do with people whose jobs are lost to automation and algorithms?<p>His proposal of universal basic income helps these people who have lost their jobs attempt a soft landing because at least they will have some income.<p>I used to be against UBI but now I fully understand why we need it, because too many jobs are going to be eliminated, and what do we do with these people who have lost their jobs? They are likely older with lower skills, and retraining programs are statistically an abject failure."
"Like most people, I&#x27;m going to keep using the word &quot;homoiconic&quot; because it is a useful term.<p>The article just shows that if you insist on an absurdly strict definition you end up with nonsense.  Even the &quot;strings&quot; based definition doesn&#x27;t work if you&#x27;re being especially literal, since there are no strings, there are just electrical fields that may or may not be in physically nearby places.<p>Everything in software is, at some level, an abstraction.  And that&#x27;s okay.<p>S-expressions are merely a textual representation; Lisp systems don&#x27;t normally store exactly the text representation.  So what?  The upshot is that homoiconic representations make certain kinds of transformations easy to use, understand, and display... and that&#x27;s what people mean today.<p>I agree that homoiconicity is not strictly boolean, but that doesn&#x27;t make it a useless concept."

"I think the degree to which open borders are a reality within the U.S. is under-appreciated. As a reminder, U.S. states are sovereign entities with their own criminal laws, tax regimes, educational systems, property and contract rights, civil rights, economic growth, industries, natural resources, etc. In some cases their laws are pre-empted by U.S. federal law, but there remains quite a bit of diversity.<p>Despite this, U.S. residents can travel or move anywhere they want within the 50 states, with no prior approval and relatively inconsequential paperwork that largely amounts to notifying local authorities after the fact.<p>Given this, I think it&#x27;s surprising, and somewhat illuminating, the degree to which population, cultural, and economic differences persist across generations. The states with the highest (MD) and lowest (WV) median household incomes are directly adjacent to one another, but WV has not been emptied by mass migration into MD. Plenty of Oregon residents complain about income taxes, but don&#x27;t move next door to Washington, which does not have an income tax. Etc.<p>I know it&#x27;s not the same as international borders, but it&#x27;s also more significant than a single national government with purely administrative regions. Thinking about this has led me to question some of the fears about open international borders."

"A colleague used an app&#x27;s &quot;generate secure password&quot; feature to change their ISP&#x27;s web portal login - which then also became the WAN router&#x27;s password - which they didn&#x27;t realise.<p>It was about a week before the router dropped its connection and needed to re-authenticate - and that&#x27;s when I was called in to investigate the loss of connectivity - which Windows 10 very unhelpfully reported as the network cable disconnected and was resetting or power-saving on the NIC so the &quot;link active&quot; LED on the switch was going out for about 2 secs every 10 sec. Cue a round of cable and switch swapping to no benefit. The LEDs for all other devices on the switch (running Linux and mostly internal servers) were behaving normally.<p>I finally backtraced to the router and a useful error message. We put two-and-two together and my colleague called up the auto-saved details in their password manager; it was long, and ALL non-alpha numeric characters - starting with a backtick, which the router would not accept. I tethered my phone to my laptop and tried to login to the Web account portal - which would NOT accept the passphrase. I tried it without the backtick &quot;just in case&quot; - nope.<p>We had to do a &quot;lost password&quot; reset on the portal..and wait for the email with link.<p>Lessons learned:<p>The ISP&#x27;s password change page did not seem to validate input, but the login page did.<p>Avoid backticks in passwords."

"It&#x27;s interesting that Teams is often compared to email or chat. It&#x27;s much more akin to a forum or bulletin board system. I&#x27;ve found this to be a pretty powerful thing to have at work. However, it does happen to fit my work groups use case very well. We work on lots of short term projects. Each of these we spin up a &quot;team&quot; for. These are 3D projects that require a lot of media sharing from a cross disciplinary which works fairly well in Teams.

"I believe most like playing intelligently. The goal of the level design shouldn’t be to make the intelligent move less rewarding, but to make the boring move less intelligent. So I kind of disagree with the offered solutions. A more modern set of solutions might be threats pursuing from the rear that make backtracking riskier than pushing forward, mobility or offensive options that favor aggressive moves over defensive moves, or (and perhaps I may only dream) non Euclidean level design such that moving backwards is actually a different area.<p>Situational awareness in competitive FPS is very impressive. I want to know what it looks like in non Euclidean space where assumptions about positioning get an order of magnitude more difficult."

"The articles contends the rich kids at Yale pretend to be poor to shirk the elite responsibilities, which then leads to deterioration of the elites. I find it doubtful that the kids have thought it through that far. A couple of more likely explanations come to mind:<p>- Rebellious teenagers always want to establish independence from their parents. Giving up part of the money takes you part of the way there.<p>- It&#x27;s hard to be friends with people much poorer than you are - they may not accept you, and you may have hard time adjusting your spending patterns creating various embarrassments. Pretending to be poorer significantly increases the number of people you can be friends with.<p>As to the deterioration of the elites, I believe that our country lacks raison d&#x27;etre, and absent a clear mission people to turn to scrutinizing wealth indicators, culture wars, and such to decide why they get up in the morning. The US used to defend freedom from the Soviets and that was a pretty solid mission in the mind of the missionaries, then it coasted for a while, then tried to fight the terrorism which frankly was never the proper scale of a mission, and now it&#x27;s just adrift."

This is why.<p>From applecare to the activation lock to app permissions to alerting user to bogus behavior to app store quality to reversible charging cables - all the activities HN considers &quot;anti-consumer&quot; have helped make consumers value apple products. This will be one of those situations.<p>Now when you buy a used phone, much more likely to have a real sense of the battery quality in what you are buying. 3 year used apple products ALREADY carry a much higher premium vs android phones, this will help continue that trend.<p>And no, it&#x27;s NOT that hard to replace a battery in an iphone, seriously, for all the folks complaining about that go to an apple store or buy a kit, and compare the hassle to doing the same thing with a android phone."
"I lived in a flat in England in the early 2000s which kept getting letters from the BBC saying we didn&#x27;t have a TV licence. The letters were sometimes more threatening for a period, then sometimes more reconciliatory.<p>They were also running TV adverts at the time claiming they had detector vans about, and if you didn&#x27;t have a licence you&#x27;d be caught. I did some research at the time, and it seemed that evidence from a detector van had never been submitted as evidence in court cases for those without a licence.<p>It didn&#x27;t take long to realise in the age of databases, it&#x27;s easier just to send out scary letters to all address without a registered licence and hope there will be some &#x27;conversion rate&#x27;. The effort required to actually chase on this seemed disproportional to the benefits.<p>And for those wondering, I did have a licence, it&#x27;s just the address the BBC had for the flat was subtly different to the one on the bit of paper.

"In a first for one of these &quot;bad places to work&quot; stories, I recognized the project she described in the &quot;A patch which wasn&#x27;t good enough (until it was)&quot; post linked from this one, so I looked up the history. Sure enough, I know the developer she was complaining about in both posts.<p>In the patch case, he asked about testing, and they realized the ssh&#x2F;scp versions she tested with weren&#x27;t the same as the ones the code was using. She promised to follow up with best-practice testing and didn&#x27;t. (Without knowing the reason, this isn&#x27;t unusual: people get busy and drop things all the time.) I didn&#x27;t get the same sense of rejection or hostility she did. And the second developer (who got her patch accepted) credited her in the code review, tested in a middle way (better than she originally did, worse than she promised to do later), requested the review from a different person than she had (why I don&#x27;t know), and got a review question with a similar tone before it was accepted. None of the parties&#x27; behavior looked unusual&#x2F;red-flag-worthy to me.<p>I don&#x27;t fault her for imperfectly describing an interaction that was five years ago when she wrote that post and is twelve years ago now. I&#x27;m trying to figure out what the lesson is and who should be learning it. A few unorganized ideas:<p>* Much of what people are thinking and feeling is left unwritten&#x2F;unsaid, so two people can have very different ideas of what happened. (A reminder I suppose to listen to both sides before making a judgement on something.)<p>* I don&#x27;t want to dismiss her feeling about bad team dynamics, even if I don&#x27;t see them in this particular interaction. &quot;At the end of the day people won&#x27;t remember what you said or did, they will remember how you made them feel.&quot; - Maya Angelou<p>* A (imo typical) code review question can seem intimidating or hostile from a senior developer when &quot;you&#x27;re already not sure you belong there at all&quot;. Maybe an in-person follow-up would have helped, either then or later (&quot;hey, did you have a chance to try writing that test? can I help? I want to get your change in&quot;). I&#x27;ve been on both sides of this one. The junior developer often wants some extra help and attention, and the senior developer is often feeling overwhelmed by the volume of questionable-quality things coming in, such that they can go into more of a gatekeeper role than trying to mentor each person thoroughly in each interaction. (I think this is what she&#x27;s talking about with &quot;Any lazy fool can deny a request and get you to &#x27;no.&#x27; It takes actual effort to appreciate and recognize what they&#x27;re trying to accomplish and try to help them get to a different &#x27;yes&#x27;.&quot;)"

"Fully Charged recently ran an interesting panel discussion that they put online yesterday with a few vehicle to grid experts: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=bkh33KjF3Gc&amp;t=0s"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=bkh33KjF3Gc&amp;t=0s</a><p>One interesting thing with vehicle to grid is that EV battery capacity is becoming a valuable commodity. It&#x27;s valuable to EV owners because they can sell back electricity to the grid and manage when they charge using either solar or simply low rate night time energy from the grid. This saves them cost and some cases makes a profit. It&#x27;s valuable to grid owners because they can serve peak demand from plugged in EVs and dump access clean energy back into them so they can stay on top of peaks in demand and supply. It&#x27;s even attractive to battery leasing companies or EV car companies responsible for managing the batteries because keeping them fully charged all the time when they are not in use is actually not that great for battery life. Some car manufacturers are already experimenting with battery warranty and vehicle to grid usage in order to take away the concerns about wearing out the battery.<p>So, vehicle to grid may be used to address exactly this issue. It&#x27;s a complicated topic of course but providing charging points to garage orphans could be a profitable business. There are all sorts of interesting things happening around this."

I used to use AwesomeWM which was by far the best DE experience I had in my life. Currently I use OSX and even though OSX looks more aesthetic I can never achieve the simplicity and efficiency of AwesomeWM. Even then, when I occasionally go back to lightweight DEs and say watch a movie, I immediately realize the VSync issue. Gnome and KDE does NOT have these minor issue but they&#x27;re also not nearly as efficient as awesome, XMonad, ratpoison, xfce, lxde etc."

"&quot;If you want to scrape the surface, a course in elementary statistics would be fine. If you want a deep conceptual understanding, you’ll probably want to know how the formula for residual sum of squares in derived, which you can learn in most courses on advanced statistics.&quot;<p>This is an extremely shallow claim. The basics of regression rely on, let&#x27;s see, understanding the normal and t distributions (each of which is described in papers far beyond an undergraduate statistics degree). To understand how the rules of probability empirically map to outcomes, you need a good understanding of the Central Limit Theorem (and thus the Squeeze Theorem, Continuous Mapping Theorem, Chebyshev&#x27;s Inequality &#x2F; WLLN, etc.) all of which are pretty sophisticated. Congrats, you now know linear regression. What about all the difference variance estimators, their properties under model misspecification, simulation properties of violations of Gauss-Markov, robust standard errors (including more advanced econometric specifications like cluster-robustness, Satterthwaite approximation of degrees of freedom, etc.)<p>If you&#x27;re willing to take a textbook&#x27;s word for it, actually using most data science stuff is as easy as spending an hour on coursera or reading some free web pdf book. Who needs any math skill? Just close your eyes when the book covers math. Like how a mechanic doesn&#x27;t need to know any physics, the data science user doesn&#x27;t need to know any math or statistics. If the pretty stars show up in the regression table you found the truth.<p>So, yes, on this level, data science requires a high school or early undergraduate understanding of calculus no more sophisticated than basic algebra, the first few weeks of matrix algebra, and the first few weeks of Calculus 1 and 2.<p>But on the other hand, to actually understand, prove, and improve on existing techniques requires the equivalent of upper division undergraduate mathematics and a graduate education in statistics."
"Walmart plays a heavy part in this game. They have such an outsized share of the market for Consumer Packaged Goods that they can bully manufacturers. When economics suggests the price of, say, some condiment needs to increase, Walmart simply refuses to accept the higher price. You can either lose your shelf space, or substitute a new, smaller, product format at the same price, which they will accept.<p>And so bottles of mustard get smaller, but stay $1.99 at Walmart. Kleenex boxes have 76 tissues instead of 88 but stay $0.99 at Walmart."

"&quot;Another $500,000 will be given to those who can find a &quot;network attack requiring no user interaction.&quot;&quot;<p>The implication of this conditional reward is that interactive use presents more&#x2F;easier attack opportunities than non-interactive use.  To clarify terminology, it is arguable that &quot;non-interactive&quot; can be a synonym for &quot;automated&quot; in this context.<p>Further, we might argue that canonical examples of &quot;interactive&quot; use are clicks, drags, taps or swipes.  In other words, the prevailing &quot;UI&quot; for many users and the one promoted by many developers.<p>Now, if you agree these are fair statements then it is also arguable that from the user&#x27;s persepctive it could be useful to engage in non-interactive&#x2F;automated use not only for reasons of efficiency or convenience but also for reasons of &quot;security&quot;.<p>Finally, given these propositions, the question I ask is why website and app users are continually faced with &quot;terms and conditions&quot; that seek to prohibit non-interactive use.  Interactive use benefits those running a website or app server in at least one obvious and significant way: <i>more interaction means more data to collect</i>.  But if we accept the implication of this bug bounty it also means greater risk to the user.<p>Regulators need to protect the user&#x27;s right to use her computer, including a &quot;smartphone&quot;, in a non-interactive manner.  This right is constantly under attack (no pun intended) by those who are in the business of collecting user data.  Interactive use can result in less data privacy and more&#x2F;easier attack opportunities."

Every moment working with python (and that infernal pep-8 linter insisting 80 characters is a sensible standard in 2019) increases my burnout by 100x.<p>I try to remind myself that we&#x27;re trying to make the industry less exclusive and more welcoming to new developers and &quot;old&quot; isn&#x27;t necessarily &quot;good&quot; (in fact, probably the opposite), but damn I just don&#x27;t understand it.<p>It used to be that I could focus on other languages (Erlang, Nemerle, F#, Haskell, Ocaml, even C++) and sort of balm myself. But now, I can&#x27;t even overcome the sinking feeling as I read the Julia statistics book that I&#x27;m going to be dragged back to Python kicking and screaming in the morning, so why even bother?<p>And frustratingly: it&#x27;s one of the few languages with decent linear algebra libraries. And that means it&#x27;s one of the few languages with good ML and statistics support. So it&#x27;s very hard not to use it because when you want to cobble together something like a Bayesian model things like PyMC or Edward actually give you performance that&#x27;s obnoxiously difficult to reproduce.<p>This is what the industry wants and evidently a lot of people are okay with it, but to me it&#x27;s misery and I can&#x27;t work out why people seem to like it so much."

"I just replaced an EV certificate with a free AWS provided one on our website. We jumped through a lot of hoops a few years ago to get our EV certificate. This was a tedious process that involved form filling, credit cards, lots of waiting and poorly documented ways of handling the actual certificates. I actually had to append some text files to that were sent via email to get a valid thing that nginx actually understood, etc. I lost non trivial amounts of time with this. Because it was so tedious, we went for long lived certificates. When we switched to amazon we preserved our investment and uploaded the certificate to AWS and used it on an ALB.<p>Since then the market has changed a lot. E.g. Letsencrypt happened and several companies, including amazon, now offer very convenient ways of getting certificates. So, last week the process was as follows: 1) I created anew certificate in the region where I needed it. 2) after waiting for it to deploy, I selected it from a drop down on the ALB where it was needed. End of story. It will take care about renewal, adds no extra cost, and requires no fiddling with text files."

"I think this is the main way to go if you care about air quality because unfortunately most consumer air quality monitors can be wildly inaccurate (i.e. detect nothing at all) even in day-to-day scenarios like making toast [0].<p>It&#x27;s not limited to particulate matter either. You can get devices with reasonably accurate basics like temperature and humidity but as soon as you get into the actual air quality stuff like CO2, things start to fall apart. There are tons of devices that use wildly inaccurate TVOC sensors or fake their CO2 measurements (they estimate it based on H2 instead).<p>If you want anything remotely close to accuracy, I strongly recommend buying something that actually tells you which sensors it has inside it. Get datasheets for the sensors and check that their specs are reasonable for what you want. For example make sure that if you want to actually measure CO2 to buy something with an NDIR sensor like the Senseair S8 inside.<p>I wanted something I could plug into my home Prometheus&#x2F;InfluxDB&#x2F;Grafana setup so I bought [1] from Taobao.

"As a neurobiologist, this interests me. I&#x27;m leaving this comment because I don&#x27;t have time to read the article rn, but what to come back and see what HN thinks about it. Briefly, and naive to the content of the article, here is my concern. Consider this network architecture...<p>You have 3000 input neurons that each makes ~10 synaptic connections with many downstream neurons, but let&#x27;s focus on just one of those downstream neurons. This downstream neuron thus has 30k synaptic connections along its dendrite. At some time t its cell body (specifically the axon hillock area) receives enough graded electrical potential from some number of those synapses to fire an &#x27;action potential&#x27; (a single electrical impulse). Some of those inputs contributed bursts of weak inputs, some may have contributed several strong inputs, some of the inputs were from synapses on very distal regions of the dendrite (therefore the graded signal was significantly weakened by the time it reached the cell body) some were from synapses very near the cell body. But they all integrate at the cell body, at which point, it doesn&#x27;t matter where they came from - they&#x27;ve arrived is all that matters now - and together their strength is enough to evoke an action potential.<p>Let&#x27;s say this action potential impulse resulted in an error of some sort, somewhere downstream in the network. If you&#x27;re playing by the rules of supervised learning with backprop, the synapses that evoked the signal producing the error-impulse should be made weaker. How? In biological NNs this is the impossible question. Signals that could target individual synapses do not propagate up axons through cell bodies up dendrites and back to synapses (you do have slow signaling that is for homeostatic scaling, but this is thought to simply scale network input up or down across all synapses).<p>This means you will need another group of neurons to send error signals back. Maybe these recurrent projections exist, and say they did, these recurrent projections would need to (1) form a 3rd party connection at every synapse and (2) know which synapses were to blame for the error. Those don&#x27;t seem like trivial phenomena from a neurophysiology perspective. I&#x27;ve read theories on local molecular tags or peptide synthesis, but they all seemed very much hand-wavy. Anything that has gained traction on those hypotheses hasn&#x27;t stood up to scrutiny.<p>The simplest theory to me, is that cortical networks on the size of human brains don&#x27;t explicitly &#x27;forget&#x27;. That is, they only learn. When you call someone Bob, and they correct you saying their name is Mike, your neural nets don&#x27;t erase Bob and replace it with Mike. They remember the old name, the new name, the embarrassing situation, all of it. Biological neural nets don&#x27;t need to explicitly forget because forgetting is (unfortunately?) a byproduct of being a biological entity. Also, neurons have finite resources (they are essentially zero-sum), so you simply will not see infinite run-up of synaptic strengths (which you might in some artificial NN without setting certain hyperparameters). Together, this suggests that recency is a fairly dominant factor when it comes to associative learning (and what gets forgotten) in biological NN."

"I grew up in farm country. Notably, it was mostly small family farms or co-operative farms that I lived around[0]<p>The observation I made about farming that always made it difficult (financially) was that all the wealth was tied up in <i>things</i>. Your acres, your livestock&#x2F;crops, your home(s) and other property. High value equipment as well (tractors aren&#x27;t cheap, neither are their accessories).<p>The issue was always turning these <i>things</i> into cash. So mortgages were one way (though if I&#x27;m being honest any one who has run a large scale farming operation probably doesn&#x27;t lean on the mortgage. You can get agribusiness loans with much better terms and crop&#x2F;livestock insurance[1]).<p>Contrary to popular belief though, the land that is actually farmed is mostly leased&#x2F;rented, but its typically a long term deal, so you don&#x27;t have to borrow millions of dollars just to increase acreage [2]<p>This was something that large corporations don&#x27;t have such trouble with (not to mention, most large agriculture companies have a portfolio of assets that they make money from, not just their production). I also noted that those in good co-operatives didn&#x27;t have as much of an issue with this either (co-ops are good market makers and can help small farmers with buying power if they need to change crops quickly in response to market demand.<p>See all the bankruptcies and delinquencies hitting wheat farmers right now [3] some of which is in part to the trade issues we&#x27;re having with China. They&#x27;re a huge net importer of certain cash crops. Most of these guys were all in on their cash crop, without a good way to get ahead of market demand to re-calibrate their crops. Livestock is much harder in this sense, but its still doable)<p>This is the common reason why older farmers tend to sell (beyond simply crushing debt. It does happen for a lot of reasons. I&#x27;m not trying to under sell this. its just hard to write up a lengthy post here without it becoming an article). So they can actually <i>cash out</i><p>[0]<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ufcmn.com&#x2F;About-Us"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ufcmn.com&#x2F;About-Us</a>

Serious question: how do you avoid “overdoing” it? Or getting to narrow with the scope besides using common sense?
"The article seems to really gloss over the fact that the &quot;escape the room&quot; concept was a media trope or even subgenre before this industry exploded. The history discussion skips the years that the concept really started becoming popular in media. The best-known examples are probably in the <i>Saw</i> franchise, but it&#x27;s also a popular genre in casual gaming. As far as I remember, it really took off ~15 years ago with Toshimitsu Takagi&#x27;s Flash games (<i>Crimson Room</i>, <i>Viridian Room</i>, <i>White Chamber</i>; the latter should not be confused with the sci-fi horror game <i>the white chamber</i>). There are other semi-popular franchises that use the concept within a larger framework, as with some of the <i>Saw</i> sequels (<i>Zero Escape</i>, <i>Danganronpa</i>).<p>This, in turn, probably has a less direct relationship to films and TV episodes that focus on a single room to save budget or create psychological tension (as with the original <i>Saw</i>), without escape necessarily being a major theme."

"If you hate python, just write whatever your hearts desires.

"I spent many years working on a project with similar goals, except in my case the statically typed language was C++11&#x2F;14 and the embedded one was a scripting language called Io.  Io is similar in implementation size and philosophy of simplicity to Lua, and C++14 template programming is probably similar to OCaml (as far as I know, not being well versed in OCaml).<p>The good part, what makes you go wow that&#x27;s neat, is that once you have a projection of types and method signatures into the other language, everything to do with that Just Works.  You get objects with appropriate types and can call methods on the object which return values that are also appropriately wrapped and typed which in turn have methods, etc.  Provided your export is complete enough, you can navigate this whole tree or web of interconnected facilities from the static language from your dynamically typed scripts.<p>However despite spending years on this, I eventually gave up most of the idea, for several reasons:<p>First, I became discouraged that it seemed no one in either the Io language or C++ communities seemed to have any interest in the project.<p>Second, I hit a number of performance walls and impracticalities which led me to view the whole endeavor as a dead-end (for the purposes I wanted to use it for and the way that I built it).<p>If you don&#x27;t export many types and methods from your host program, you find yourself often needing to tab out of your script editor to add another type or method to the exports list so you can call it.  This requires recompiling the host program, removing much of the benefit of writing in a scripting language.<p>If you go the opposite way and try to export everything, your executable size balloons.  Dead code elimination can&#x27;t optimize away methods you exported script bindings for and didn&#x27;t use, because it can&#x27;t statically determine that you might not be using it or use it in the future.  The executable size and unused exported bindings also has an adverse effect on compile times.<p>Managing values via proxy objects (the bridge between the script and the static language) also imposes a heap allocated memory model.  This might be less of a penalty if the static host language is also garbage collected, but for C++ you lose a lot of opportunities to treat pure values more efficiently.<p>Conversely the wide varieties of ways C++ has to refer to instances of types:  by value, by reference, by pointer, const or not, etc. posed a special problem for script binding.  My quixotic goal was to fully support every C++ method signature; it would be silly if you couldn&#x27;t pass a T value to something expecting T const reference.  Therefore I included a type coercion graph attached to the bound types.<p>This required a lot of deep thought about references to temporaries and lifetimes of ephemeral values (I had to change the proxy objects to hold a cached copy of the C++ object, in most cases.)  But it was string handling which really showed why the idea of automatically coercing the bound types to make method calls Just Work was a bad idea.<p>My core C++ code used 8-bit char strings.  When porting to Windows I needed the scripts to pass these to wide char Window OS functions.  I thought, OK, I&#x27;ll just write a type converter for this.  The problem with that is you need to specify a 3rd thing - the desired encoding - when converting strings.  There simply isn&#x27;t enough information just given the &quot;from&quot; type and the &quot;to&quot; type to make an intelligent decision what to do.<p>The relevance of all of the above to script language embedding in general is that it&#x27;s often unclear how far to go with automatic conversion of types.  Even if you don&#x27;t foolishly try as much automatic conversion and even you don&#x27;t program in a host language with as many type decorators as C++ has, you still have the fundamental question of whether to decay host primitive types into script language primitive types or keep them proxied.<p>The final problem is that now either all your tooling (debugger, profiler, etc.) doesn&#x27;t work, because it doesn&#x27;t understand your script language or at best you have to jump between higher and lower level tools.  I actually wrote a gdb-wrapper which enabled debugging Io language in the C++ IDE and display Io language variables in the IDE watch window.  Then gdb on my system got updated and my wrapper could no longer parse the gdb output correctly.<p>In light of all this, I decided that in the case when you are the one writing both the host code and the interpreted code, you&#x27;re better off just writing the whole application in the host language.<p>And yet, I&#x27;ve also been burned subsequently by using host-language-implemented DSL&#x27;s (as exposed to external DSL or script).  So I don&#x27;t exactly know what the right answer is.  I dream of coming up with an intermediate approach which externalizes more of the &quot;text&quot; of the DSL while retaining the host-language static typing."

"When I visited Paris, I could see the Arc de Triomphe from the Louvre and thought I would just walk there.  After all the walking I&#x27;d already done I gave up and took the Metro the last two stops.<p>My sense of distance was thrown off by how monstrously huge the Arc is.  I don&#x27;t know where they take the pictures of it from, but standing across the street from it I had to just about stand on my head to get the whole thing into frame on my camera.<p>And as big as the Arc is, the Napoleonic Louvre is bigger (And, I might add, covered with his initial, like a child marking his belongings).  And they additions were made in such a way that from the outside it looks five times bigger than it is.  There&#x27;s a certain element of shock and awe going on here.<p>The only thing I&#x27;ve seen on a similar scale is the Washington Monument, and you understand why all the pictures of the Lincoln statue make it look like it&#x27;s immediately behind the pillars.  It is not.  It&#x27;s on the far end of a large room, also too big to get into frame.  It&#x27;s just so big that it destroys perspective.<p>To people confronted with this for the first time, I can see how they might wonder why they didn&#x27;t stop at a smaller monument.  In an era without high rises, there&#x27;s a bit of grotesquery about the scale of these things. They were paid for on the backs of the lower class. I&#x27;m sure it was a very concrete image of the slide back into monarchy.<p>The only thing I&#x27;ve seen on a similar scale in the US, aside from nature, is the Lincoln Memorial.  Seeing the monument, you understand why all the pictures of the Lincoln statue make it look like it&#x27;s immediately behind the pillars.  It is not.  It&#x27;s on the far end of a large room, also too big to get into frame.  It&#x27;s just so big that it destroys perspective.<p>Now, in an era of high rise apartments, the ridiculous proportions prevent these buildings from simply being swallowed in a sea of truly mundane buildings of comparable size.

"maybe not in this case, but from a history of machining, motors have made quiet and remarkable strides.  original cone lathes for metalworking were driven by steam engines and a PTO driveshaft.  aside from being ridiculously dangerous to operate, they had inconsistent results for tight tolerances.  It wasnt unheard of for watchmakers to also find themselves as lathemakers in the early 20th century.  Motor speed from PTO was largely not variable.<p>During WWII motor speed was controlled with a clutch and transmission system, which arguably allowed for the type of finesse and control you need to run a shaper for a large tank engine, or a mill for certain explosives of the nuclear persuasion.  older machinists handbooks will still reference your &#x27;gear&#x27; when making a cut as a feed rate suggestion.  old shapers still have a gearbox and shifter.<p>along comes the VSM and its a game changer.  The variable motor speed can control RPM maximum down to almost zero RPM. In the early 20th century, this simply was not possible.  Previously if you wanted to change speed you had to park&#x2F;reset the lathe and dial your tolerances back in.  The way around gear speed change time was to intentionally oversize the part and take it to an automatic filer, but this wears down files and is only an option for certain manufacturers that care about the end product more than the tool wear (WWII again)"

"Hi folks, I recently left Google (8 years, 4 months, 4 days :)) and co-founded a deep learning startup. We’re building a large scale model to learn human behavior and detect, predict, and explain suspicion and fraud. Our focus is on insurance involving human beings, accidents and their health - such as disability, workers’ compensation and other areas.<p>“Insurance” may sound like a boring problem domain, but it’s far from that. On the ethical side, it’s a huge problem, with estimated $40B-$80B paid out to fraud annually, with very little recourse to the fraudsters. And we’re all paying for it. The detection process today is almost entirely manual&#x2F;human intuition based, not data driven. Our mission is to put a stop to this loop hole by leveraging large historical data sets and deep learning and introducing a modern, systematic real-time detection approach. We put it in the hands of professional detectives. We provide realtime monitoring, alerts, explanations and supporting evidence.<p>The data set is a time series of events starting with an accident + injury, followed up by many diagnosis, interviews, witness statements, medical reports; treatments, with some final outcome. The outcome can be a full recovery, partial disability or a permanent disability.<p>This time series is represented by a large structured as well as large unstructured corpus (10s of millions of documents). The problem domain is super interesting - we’re building a real world “Minority Report” to stop bad actors from abusing the system, and help the good actors get paid immediately, and stop bad medical providers from doing evil.<p>There is a lot of interesting NLP work. The data sets you’d be working with involve individual demographics, job histories, geography mapping, health history, injury causes, recovery and treatment methods, objective witness statements and subjective claimant reports, industry codes, criminology, graph theory and workplace safety, to name a few.<p><a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.propublica.org&#x2F;article&#x2F;health-insurers-make-it-easy-for-scammers-to-steal-millions-who-pays-you"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.propublica.org&#x2F;article&#x2F;health-insurers-make-it-e...</a>

"The results from this study are interesting but I am even more interested in the definitions of wisdom. I&#x27;ve been ruminating lately on the difference between knowledge (narrowly defined as a set of facts) vs experience. The most tortured analogy would be someone who has spent a lifetime reading books about swimming vs. a person who has spent all of their life swimming in pools&#x2F;rivers&#x2F;lakes. I realize this a non-standard and narrow definition of knowledge but I hope it is possible to bear with me since I can&#x27;t think of a suitable synonym to separate phenomenological experience from book learning.<p>It does seem that our conceptions of intelligence are related to facts&#x2F;knowledge more so than experiences. Intelligence appears to be a facility to collect, organize, analyze and draw conclusions from a set of facts. In that purely analytic view of intelligence, knowledge is highly prized. However it seems to me wisdom is more closely associated with lived experience. For certain, there does seem to be a rough distinction between someone we consider &quot;knowledgeable&quot;, someone we consider &quot;intelligent&quot;, and someone we consider &quot;wise&quot;.<p>This supposes there is some aspect of phenomenological experience that is inherently different than the collection of facts and further some aspect of cognition separate from the organization and analyzation of facts. I am very interested in the sorts of things that separate my previous distinctions: knowledgeable, intelligent, wise. Could we realize a Turing-like test for wisdom?"

A word about the &quot;faggot&quot; usage: it was a necessary tool. It showed three things: they were not in control, if they were the usage would have be stopped. Everyone out there needed to see t%his. Two, it made it unpleasant for them to be in the headspace, which has obvious advantages. Three, it pointed out impersonators of BS because they would not call each other faggot, thus helping to mitigate the spread of false information.

With PEP572, even though it was clearly controversial, I chose &#x27;Yes, I want to do this&#x27;, and people didn&#x27;t agree to disagree.<p>This is a characteristically practical, effective Dutch attitude, known as the &quot;Polder Model&quot;. The United States currently suffers from the opposite problem of extreme partisanship and gridlock.<p><a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Polder_model"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Polder_model</a><p>The polder model (Dutch: poldermodel) is consensus decision-making, based on the acclaimed Dutch version of consensus-based economic and social policy making in the 1980s and 1990s.<p>The polder model has been described as &quot;a pragmatic recognition of pluriformity&quot; and &quot;cooperation despite differences&quot;. It is thought that the Dutch politician Ina Brouwer was the first to use the term poldermodel, in her 1990 article &quot;Het socialisme als poldermodel?&quot; (Socialism as polder model?), although it is uncertain whether she coined the term or simply seems to have been the first to write it down.<p>[...] Other uses<p>The term polder model and especially the verb polderen (to polder) has been used pejoratively by some politicians to describe the slow decision-making process where all parties have to be heard. The model flourished under the &quot;Purple&quot; governments of Dutch prime minister Wim Kok, a coalition including the traditional rivals the Labour Party (a social-democratic party, whose colour is red) and the People&#x27;s Party for Freedom and Democracy (right-wing liberals, whose colour is blue). In the declining economic climate of the early 21st century the model came under fierce attack particularly from right-wing politicians and Pim Fortuyn in his book entitled De puinhopen van acht jaar Paars (&quot;The wreckage of eight years Purple&quot;).<p>Historical background<p>[...] A third explanation refers to a unique aspect of the Netherlands, that it consists in large part of polders, land reclaimed from the sea, which requires constant pumping and maintenance of the dykes. So ever since the Middle Ages, when the process of land reclamation began, different societies living in the same polder have been forced to cooperate because without unanimous agreement on shared responsibility for maintenance of the dykes and pumping stations, the polders would have flooded and everyone would have suffered. Crucially, even when different cities in the same polder were at war, they still had to cooperate in this respect. This is thought to have taught the Dutch to set aside differences for a greater purpose."

"The idea that web communities and content have become standardized enough to have a single look-and-feel client is an intriguing idea. And it looks beautiful.<p>Unfortunately, I just wouldn&#x27;t install a native app for that. My browser is plenty performant to handle it, and I want to be able to call it up wherever I am -- on my home computer, work computer, friend&#x27;s computer, backup work laptop, whatever -- without having to bother to install something. (And some companies don&#x27;t let you install software.) Also I&#x27;d want to hide stories I&#x27;ve already read and want that to be synced, which necessitates a server anyways.<p>I&#x27;m genuinely curious what benefit a native app has here, why that direction was taken? I can honestly only see drawbacks. (I can understand an app on mobile, just not on desktop.)"

"Calling the Friedrichstraße a popular shopping street is not really correct. It&#x27;s pretty crowded by foot and car traffic because it&#x27;s close to Checkpoint Charlie and not far from the Brandenburger Tor.
But it&#x27;s not very popular. For normal customers, new soulless shopping malls have been built in other areas. For luxury shopping, people go to Kurfürstendamm. There&#x27;s a small shopping mall that&#x27;s 80% empty (Quartier 205 or 206).
The idea to close the street for traffic is also to see if it makes it more popular again. But then it should be done during the week,too."

"The bar just keeps moving higher. Right now making a website that looked good a decade a go is very easy, but the cutting edge is about responsive, highly interactive applications. Additionally they are constructed by teams of people, increasing the level of complexity because of the need to share code while staying dependency-free. Client applications have become increasingly complex for anything that isn&#x27;t a trivial website that mostly displays information. Complexity management on the client side I think is its own paradigm that is often not given enough credit and then people get surprised why their UI grows increasingly fragile while taking days to implement seemingly simple features.<p>Ironically some of the tools in the article will probably grow old which is part of the difficulty here. People learn the libraries, then it seems a new, better library comes along and makes things even better. Everything comes together once you learn it&#x27;s about managing the algorithms, data, as well as rendering to the screen."

"A likely factor in this lawsuit is the excellent investigative series done by InsideClimate News. They were a finalist for a Pulitzer for this series.<p>Part [1] covers the beginnings of Exxon&#x27;s own climate research in the late 70s, and the findings of their scientists, which was approximately accurate to modern climate behavior today, 40 years later. Back in 1979, Exxon outfitted some of their ships with equipment to detect CO2 absorption in the ocean along their routes; Exxon was, at the time, one of the leading climate research organizations in the world.<p>Part [2] covers some of Exxon&#x27;s research and findings in more detail.<p>Part [3] describes the climate models that Exxon&#x27;s researchers developed in the early 80s, and some of the early decisions that corporate leadership made to downplay the implications of these models and search for other poorly-founded ideas that might rebut them.<p>Part [4] is about Exxon&#x27;s discovery of and response to a major CO2 source in the South China Sea.<p>Part [5] briefly talks about synthetic fuel technology under development in the 1980s and the impact that early climate science might have had on exploring that technology.<p>And [6] finally gets to the meaty part where, after well over a decade of their own research efforts were telling them otherwise, company executives began a misinformation campaign through the 90s and 2000s, downplaying the certainty of climate science and its potential effects.<p>You can also explore a pile of internal Exxon documents yourself [7].<p>The comparison between energy companies and tobacco companies is apt.

Which is absurd for a $1500 laptop. And they made it sound like it was just a minor issue - &quot;oh everything works great except the keyboard&quot;. As if a laptop without a keyboard isn&#x27;t practically useless.<p>My wife&#x27;s Macbook Air developed an issue last week after installing the latest OS update. The computer would just freeze randomly making it impossible to use. Apple Support said that it was a known issue with the update. A known issue that was still released?!<p>I moved to Apple because I was frustrated with Windows. But even the $400 Windows I&#x27;ve owned in the past gave me at least 2 years with their keyboards. And Windows has been painfully slow and error prone, but no update has ever crippled my laptop as the last macOS update did my wife&#x27;s Macbook Air.<p>If you&#x27;re going to charge me a massive premium for a product, at least make sure that it works.<p>Sorry for ranting here, but these two issues happened within a week of each other and I&#x27;ve just been angry and disappointed"
Maybe it has something to do with all the recent speculative side channel attacks. Intel seems to have more hardware vulnerabilities than AMD.
"I have no relationship with Amazon Publishing, nor am I ever likely to. My experience of publishing with Amazon is entirely restricted to their (now defunct) CreateSpace platform and its successor, Kindle Direct Publishing, alongside publishing works on 3rd party self-publishing platforms and attempting to get those books listed on Amazon.<p>My personal view, developed over a number of years, is that Amazon is a toxic environment for self-publishing authors:<p>- Their price modelling is designed to undercut other self-publishing platforms to the point of damaging them. If an author publishes on a 3rd party platform, Amazon will demand that the price point for the book is double the viable price listing on Amazon - so that they can offer the book to readers at a 50% discount (from day 1 of listing). Authors have no control over when the discount is applied, or the level of discount, or for how long it will last. The last time I checked (several years ago, things may have changed since) authors were paid a percentage of the price at which the book was sold, not its original price point.<p>- Publishing both on Amazon and on a 3rd party platform is not prohibited; however Amazon demand that the list pricing on their platform must be as cheap (or preferably cheaper) than on those other sites (before any discounts are applied). If they find a book listed elsewhere at a cheaper price they will automatically price-match without warning the author. Running a temporary price reduction promotion for a book on another platform can lead to a permanent price reduction for the book on Amazon.<p>- If an author wants to give away a book for free, this is possible on other platforms, but not on Amazon - unless the author enrolls the book in their KDP Select program, which will allow the author to offer strictly time-limited free giveaway windows ...<p>- Except an author can only enroll a book on KDP Select if they remove that book from all other platforms and agree to publish exclusively on Amazon. This includes removing the book from profitable venues such as Google Play and Apple Books (which are ideal for iPad&#x2F;iPhone and Android devices).<p>- I could go on (but won&#x27;t).<p>Many people will disagree with my personal &#x27;toxic environment&#x27; view. That&#x27;s fine. Self-publishing on the Amazon platforms is often enough to meet the needs of many self-published authors, and quite often profitable for them too.<p>But for me the above points all indicate that Amazon is interested only in killing diversity and creating a readership monopoly, which in the longer run will damage self-publishing and prove to be toxic to both authors and readers alike."

"I will say, I miss the days when the first comment here would be “Paging Mr. Cutts...” followed by actual insight from Matt on what’s happening here!<p>Is there any other double-digit employee at Google around now who can take up the mantle?"
"I find it interesting that Elsevier gets blamed, when authors could simply publish in alternative journals.<p>Why don’t they?  Because their career is dependent on high impact journals because their bosses don’t care about lesser publications.<p>This problem could be readily solved if they turned their anger against the school administration for pretty much forcing authors to publish in Elsevier journals."
"I haven&#x27;t found the term particularly useful either.  What I do like to say is that in Lisp, <i>the AST is a public interface</i>.  That is, the AST is defined by a specification and is not going to change, so that you can write code that manipulates it and know that the next compiler version won&#x27;t break your code — indeed, it&#x27;s portable across implementations.  Also, the AST&#x27;s structure is relatively simple to explain (though there are some &quot;gotchas&quot; you have to watch out for when manipulating it, like inadvertent variable capture), and macros provide a convenient interface for receiving an AST from the compiler or interpreter and supplying back a transformed AST.<p>Other languages could provide similar facilities, and indeed a few have done so.  But the more complex the syntax of the language, the more difficult it is to do that in a usable way."
"It&#x27;s worth mentioning that most cryptographic algorithms are designed to be strong using pseudo random algorithms, so real randomness isn&#x27;t a requirement (although obviously some unpredictable starting point is required to get the ball rolling).<p>Well unless you use a one time pad but nobody does (hopefully)."
Are we sure this actually occurred?  If anything this is going to make it easier for american banks to exploit students and side-step legislation that would actually fix the root of the student debt bubble in America.<p>By this I mean people will now just point to Canada and demand a bailout without really committing effort to passing laws that will prevent exploitative interest rates and pricing schemes by private universities.
"I think the bulwark against it is a society being clear on what its moral axioms are. Like in the US, &quot;all men are created equal&quot;, where we understand &quot;men&quot; to mean &quot;people&quot;. There are certainly forces in the US that do not want to accept this as true, but the existence of the stated value and national identity helps to defend it. Same with the bill of rights.<p>And on a personal level, identifying ones own values and principles explicitly and reviewing them periodically can help guide one&#x27;s path as society changes."

"This makes feel a bit sad&#x2F;somber, because a lot of people are missing out on the exhilarating power of using advanced powerful type systems. I wish the ML community had picked up a few notes from Python, and built an Ocaml-like language with beginner-friendly Pythonic syntax (Reason comes close). I wrote about this here in the past (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=15549101);"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=15549101);</a> quoting myself below:<p><i>I&#x27;m a big fan of strong static type systems. I believe type-safety increases code quality significantly.
I used to think several years ago, that the main benefit of strong static typing was code safety &#x2F; eliminating a whole class of bugs. But I&#x27;ve changed my opinion. I now think the biggest benefit is that it makes the code a lot easier for other people to read and understand.<p>I mean I have multiple personal projects where I&#x27;ve used Python (which is a dynamically typed language), but these are small one-off projects. But I think when working in a team, especially a large team, having types becomes a huge thing. Having types for objects is especially useful. Having types forces you to think more clearly about the structure of your data.<p>It&#x27;s really sad when I see `foo(bar)`, and I have no idea what the type of `bar` is, and if it&#x27;s an object, I have no idea what fields `bar` has. I have to simply guess the structure of the various implicit types by looking at the code (sigh). It makes the code difficult to read, and rather unpleasant to work on. Not to mention, all the multitude of bugs that come from duck&#x2F;dynamic typing.<p>I don&#x27;t think good statically typed languages are hard to use at all. Type inference has spread everywhere that the old argument of having to repeat your types doesn&#x27;t hold anymore. TypeScript, Flow (JavaScrpt), Haskell, languages from the ML family are really good at type inference. Even the `auto` type inference in C++17 was better than I&#x27;d expected.</i><p>If dynamic typing continues to grow in popularity, I don&#x27;t want to even begin to fathom the number of large projects that are going to built, which will suffer from a avalanche of TypeError-class bugs that could have easily been avoided with static typing. One encouraging sign I&#x27;ve seen in the Python world is that <i>optional</i> static typing is reluctantly being adopted in many circles. There was mypy for a while, and now, there&#x27;s a new type checker called Pyre (written in Ocaml). I find hope in these little things."

"&gt; Social Security numbers are the keys to the kingdom. In this country, people get a unique number when they’re born, and the Social Security Administration tells them it’s secret and valuable. Then we use that number to pay taxes, to get government benefits, to apply to college, to get a mortgage, to apply for a car loan, to open a bank account, to track our credit. We’re asked to hand over this number again and again to institutions that have failed to guard it.<p>This is the problem right here.<p>To that sorry list, I would add medical providers&#x27; offices (doctors and dentists), all of which seem to request social security numbers for some reason on their patient intake forms, when all they should need is the patients&#x27; insurance information as printed on their insurance card."

"A few tips from my RSI journey. I had developed a severe case ~8ish years ago. It took 1.5 years before I could code full-time again. Was a very painful period. It&#x27;s still difficult for me to code beyond 40 hours a week, which makes side projects difficult.<p>The most effective techniques for my (partial) recovery, and for keeping the severe pain at bay for the last 6 years:<p>- I never ever use standard computer mice, and try to avoid the trackpad as much as possible. For me, they were worse than the keyboard. Instead, I&#x27;ve been using a Wacom tablet (with pen) for years. I&#x27;ve gotten several colleagues who were experiencing pain to use pen tablets as well, with uniformly good results.<p>- Further reducing the need to leave the keyboard by switching to vim and also using spectacle for window management. I found vim-adventures.com very effective for learning vim - not affiliated with the project in anyway, just a very happy user.<p>- Always coding with my elbow a touch over 90 degrees. I find that placing the keyboard on my lap is the most comfortable (although that maybe dependant on body proportions). In my opinion most desks are way to high for comfortable ergonomics, my lap happens to be everywhere I am, so that&#x27;s convenient.<p>- Plenty of exercise developing back muscles (which I had completely neglected prior)"
"The part that Python really bothers me, as someone who had write Python for almost 10 years, and right now doing it professionally, though personally I don&#x27;t consider myself a Python developer rather than a Python senior user, is actually obvious to nail down, and frustratingly, difficult to handle.<p>SLOW. The sin of all. I don&#x27;t want to make other arguments with people who just come to repeat &#x27;Oh you can make it fast, you are doing it the wrong way&#x27;. Sorry, I have heard that 100 times, now is sounds like bug-as-feature excuse to me.<p>Sorry, but Python is just slow. All the stuff people might bring up is just trying everything to bypass Python itself. Multiprocessing is hell to work with, buggy and unpredictable. Cython is OK but it is not Python.<p>Python&#x27;s slowness is like cancer, and terminally so. Down deep, it is because its overtly flexible&#x2F;loose type system, the never-going-away GIL, and prematurely exposing of C-API makes it almost impossible to optimize without breaking the existing compatibility.<p>And most importantly, I don&#x27;t think it is solvable, truth is the patches are so integrated, people already forget what problem they tried to fix in the first place and just live with it.<p>But it will haunt Python in long term though, people will be struggling with Python in performant production until they start reimagining a world that without Python. Maybe a better Python in that sense."

"Another distortion and subversion of capitalism by central banks. They are either stupid and naive, or colluding in the channeling of newly printed money directly into executives&#x27; pockets.<p>Sometimes before, and inevitably after, their stint at the Fed&#x2F;BoE&#x2F;BoJ&#x2F;ECB, they will be executives at those same companies, or the banks that take a cut of the transaction (print, repo, bond, equity, option - rinse, repeat).<p>If those same CBs lose control and rates rise, and&#x2F;or business turns down and margins decrease, those bonds will still be due, even when the shares they replaced would have fallen without any obligation. The company credit rating decreases.

"The article links tech debt to financial debt early on, and this is exactly what the analogy is - it is best to be as literal as possible about it.<p>What is good debt? It&#x27;s taking money from someone, promising to pay them back more money in the future, and using the original money to make <i>even more money than that</i>, so both you and the lender profit.<p>Good tech debt is just the same. It&#x27;s taking shortcuts now to save time and get something shipped, knowing that it will cost you more time than you&#x27;re saving now to fix it later. But by shipping now, you ensure there is a later, with a product that&#x27;s out there and being used, a bigger team and therefore adequate time and then some to fix the debt <i>and</i> keep improving the product. Everyone wins.<p>That&#x27;s the theory anyway. I think mostly where it goes awry in the wild is people forgetting the paying it off part. Part of this deal is you have to pay back your lender - they have to win too. It&#x27;s just easily forgotten because <i>you&#x27;re</i> the lender, so the incentives get a bit conflicted, and you&#x27;ll keep giving yourself more time. But if the lender ultimitely doesn&#x27;t get paid back and loses, you lose, and it&#x27;s a bad debt."

"Has anyone ever seen an online community (with more than a handful of users) that focuses on more than cute puppy pictures and that is not described as &quot;toxic&quot; by &quot;critics&quot;? I&#x27;d say that HN does a great job at avoiding that. The article is titled &quot;moderating hacker news&quot; but fails to describe just how good a job the moderators and owners are doing. The moderators for moderation, and the owners for (as I perceive it) giving the moderators the freedom to try things that are best for the community (such as the politics-free experiment)."
I think this deserves a reminder that Facebook cancels all of your licenses to all of their software (which includes such things as React) if you are in any sort of patent dispute with them (whether they&#x27;ve filed it against you or you against them).
"“Churn” is definitely an issue. And JavaScript does have its own complexities.

"Let&#x27;s picture a mechanical throttle, with force feedback to indicate conflicting inputs, and self positioning to indicate current settings.  Spiffy!  The interest in this thread is understandable.<p>Except this is 7th fleet, so operational tempo and deferred maintenance means those new throttles will be variously broken.  So now absence of force sometimes means no conflict, and sometimes doesn&#x27;t.  And position sometimes indicates setting, and sometimes doesn&#x27;t.  You just need to keep track of what maintenance state each throttle of each pair is in.  But don&#x27;t worry, mechanical inputs for continuous variables reduces cognitive load.<p>And maybe instead of a mechanically complex positioner, we&#x27;ll put a more reliable indicator next to the throttle.  I know, it could be screen.  Or even better, let&#x27;s have both!<p>And ... oh, never mind.<p>Just two observations.<p>First, apropos unilateral transfer of control.<p>&quot;In addition to the coordinated procedure, a unilateral procedure, in which one station could take control of thrust from another station by action of only one station, was also available. However, the unilateral procedure is not relevant to the accident and will not be discussed further in this report.&quot; Page 6 (pdf&#x27;s 16).<p>&quot;Considering the speed and timing of the control transfer, the NTSB concludes that the unintended shift in steering control from the helm to the lee helm station on the John S McCain was likely  a unilateral transfer initiated from the lee helm station. [...] and contributed to the errors that led to the accident.&quot; Page 26 (36).  Reflected in Findings 7 and 8.<p>Second, apropos the big red button.<p>&quot;According to the John S McCain’s emergency procedures and other written directives, the helmsman’s first action in response to a loss of steering was to press the emergency-override-to-manual button. This action would have shifted steering to the helm station in the backup manual mode.  However,  the  helmsman  told  investigators that, during  the accident, he  did  not press the emergency-override-to-manual button  because  he  believed  that  this sent  steering  control to  aft steering (an opinion shared by other bridge watch standers interviewed by investigators)&quot;<p>It seems the accident might have been avoided if the single big red button in the middle of the console, ambiguously labeled &quot;EMERGENCY OVERRIDE TO MANUAL&quot;, had been sharpied with &quot;Get manual helm control&quot;."

"It&#x27;s actually kind of unfortunate, as in some ways an organization&#x27;s name is a much more meaningful expression of identity than a domain name is. When I visit the website for my bank, I don&#x27;t really care that the entity I&#x27;m communicating with owns &quot;mybank.com&quot;. What I, and I suspect most people, are really concerned with is that the entity they&#x27;re communicating with is the same physical, real-world organization they opened a bank account with in the past.<p>The problem is that legal corporation names are much harder to verify than domain names, and even once verified they don&#x27;t always match user expectations (as Ian Carroll so aptly demonstrated with his Stripe Inc. certificate). Furthermore, and perhaps partially as a result of the aforementioned issues, browsers don&#x27;t treat EV certificates in a way which would allow any meaningful security guarantees to be built on top of them.<p>I wonder if there are ways this situation could be improved. Brand names, for example, are probably more likely to match user expectations than legal company names. Perhaps an alternative to EV could be built around that idea."

He just sat and listened until he heard something he didn’t like, he quickly took over the meeting, admonished the CEO, and insisted they we do as he said.    For the remainder of the meeting the CEO and his team sat head facing the conference table, it was clear they were all terrified.<p>Once the key parts of the meeting were decided this man got up and left, the meeting quickly ended.

"&gt; When a man explodes in anger over something seemingly insignificant, he may appear like just a jerk. But he could be anxious.<p>What&#x27;s in a name...
Its amazing the difference a title makes. Being &quot;a jerk&quot; is frowned upon, its &quot;bad&quot; and the jerk should know better. But when its &quot;anxiety&quot; its met with compassion and understanding. He needs help not a stern look.<p>Why do we feel that the jerk has agency over his actions but the anxious man doesn&#x27;t?
If anything, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s the opposite: the poor titleless jerk has no option but to be like he is. The anxious one could seek treatment to reconfigure his behaviour.<p>This whole arbitrary divide between agency and fatalism pops up again and again.

Clearly it works - but an important design lesson for me!"

When I finally did get something from the DMV, it was too small to be a license plate and was simply a note that said &quot;Sorry, your requested plate conflicts with a motorcycle plate, so we have to deny your request.&quot; Huge bummer, but I guess 127.0.0.1 becomes 127001 in their systems."

Trump demands $4 billion to &quot;take a blind eye&quot; at 1015+ (link missing from report, unsure how). Here&#x27;s pieces of dialogue:<p>1015 The President requests four billion and henry Porter agrees to it. Some dialogue below.
1017 Donald Trump: Why don&#x27;t you think about it.
1017 Henry Porter: I don&#x27;t need to think about it. I&#x27;m ready for you to find out what we&#x27;re really about.
1017 Gigi Hadid: I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a good idea Henry.
1017 Henry Porter: ...no shit. Jelena just stop talking about it.
1018 Gigi Hadid: About what?
1018 Henry Porter: The child raping.
1018 Donald Trump: What the fuck are you talking about?
1018 Gigi Hadid: Mr. President we are child rapists.
1018 Donald Trump: You cannot be serious.
1018 Donald Trump: You&#x27;re gonna need $4 billion for me to take a blind eye.
1019 ?: People are laughing because they think four billion is too much. I think it&#x27;s not a problem when you have $35 billion.

Jack Dorsey provides a statement defining who their group is: &quot;The Illum%inati is an underground organization of child rapists and homosexuals.&quot; Matthew Porter: &quot;We have to thin the herd, so Barack is going to explain a few things.&quot; At 232 Barack Obama says the following: &quot;You people have to realize we are child rapi&#x27;sts.

A word about the &quot;faggot&quot; usage: it was a necessary tool. It showed three things: they were not in control, if they were the usage would have be stopped. Everyone out there needed to see t%his. Two, it made it unpleasant for them to be in the headspace, which has obvious advantages. Three, it pointed out impersonators of BS because they would not call each other faggot, thus helping to mitigate the spread of false information. Apologies for those unintentionally offended.<p>Of special interest to the LGBT community, I give you Barack Obama in a foursome with Peter Thiel, Jack Dorsey, and Matthew Porter.

"I&#x27;m relatively new (this year) to HN, but it has quickly become my favorite site for news (and tech news). While part of the reason for this is the clean, non-commercialized interface, the primary reason I frequent this site is the expert commentary on posts."
"To everyone in this thread: this is an article, not a question to HackerNews."
"To someone attempting to return to web dev after a break of a decade or so, my normal response is incredulity at the absolute horrorshow that&#x27;s arisen. To me it&#x27;s a complete towering, teetering mess of differing approaches, needlessly heavyweight frameworks, terrible decisions, and inefficiency. This is probably the ultimate cliched comment but I honestly cannot understand how any self-respecting developer can work with this xxxx and look themselves in the mirror."
"Python’s killer feature - and perhaps reason for its popularity- seems to be it’s nice-looking syntax, which is only the most superficial of qualities.  Below that surface, the semantics and its standard libraries are all very irregular, and always leave a bad taste in my mouth.  I now avoid touching it if i can."
"I was hoping to read that it might also help people like myself who suffer from tinnitus. Sadly, no.<p>Still, if it can restore hearing to the deaf, this is a good thing."
"&gt; But if you transform the image into a format that doesn‘t have PNG’s complexity (in a low-privilege process, of course), the malicious nature of the PNG ‘should’ be eliminated and then safe for parsing at a higher privilege level. Even if the attacker manages to compromise the low-privilege process with a malicious PNG, the high-privilege process will only parse the compromised process&#x27; output with a simple, plausibly-safe parser.<p>It&#x27;s interesting to get a sense of how deeply unrealistic they think it is, to write a safe parser for a typical data format in an unsafe language."
"&gt;The most ideologically motivated or extreme posts and comments on Hacker News—an interview piece from Quillette titled “Understanding Victimhood Culture”; a link to a video of James Damore and Jordan Peterson in conversation; one user telling another that all Jewish people should relocate to Israel—tend to get flagged by the community or the site’s anti-abuse systems, many of which Bell and Gackle have written themselves...<p>&gt;When stories that focus on structural barriers faced by women in the workplace, or on diversity in tech, or on race or masculinity—stories, admittedly, that are more intriguing to me, a person interested in the humanities, than stories on technical topics—hit the front page, users often flag them, presumably for being off topic, so fast that hardly any comments accrue.<p>These are features, not bugs, and testaments to the quality moderation.  All over the internet these topics are discussed, ad nauseam, and they&#x27;re some of the most divisive issues in modern day discourse.  Even the author can&#x27;t seem to represent her political opponents fairly.<p>Without removing these topics, these ideological wars will irrevocably divide the community, sending one segment away in deep frustration.  If we&#x27;d like to unify society, it&#x27;s far more important to have spaces which don&#x27;t immediately polarize along these lines."
"For anybody who has used a Vt52, H19, or similar terminal, there is no mystery. Before we had bitmap graphics, we had fill-in forms with ASCII graphics. A vertical line made with solid bars looked uneven, but the gap in the bar was the same height as the gap between a bar and the one above or below it, so it made a pleasing vertical dashed line to match the horizontal lines of actual hyphens and equal signs.<p>Nowadays, of course, if you want a line, you draw a line, so the gap no longer has a purpose."
"I honestly think that there should be some sort of ethics course required of CS students (like how MBA students are often required to take a class in business ethics, and doctors are required to learn medical ethics).<p>Engineers who behave unethically without asking questions aren&#x27;t good engineers--at least, they&#x27;re not the sort of engineers we want to be creating."
"It was the best of times, it was the worst of times :-)<p>I really really liked the Amiga (and was a fairly regular contributor to the comp.sys.amiga newsgroup), I also interviewed for a job at Commodore HQ in Frankfurt (the actual headquarters of the tax shelter known as Commodore :-)). And one of the things that became painfully obvious was the Commodore was not set up to make Amiga successful, they didn&#x27;t have the correct organizational structure nor the core corporate values that would make them successful.<p>At the time I was working at Sun, had joined as a reasonably early engineer, and watched how Sun had grown from a scrappy &quot;start up with great pretensions&quot; to something DEC and IBM started actually losing market share too. I saw the market for Amiga as coming up as a low priced workstation, not the bargain basement home PC. But it could be both, and for a while that path was making progress with the A500 and the A2000.<p>It was hard to do though, the workstation market really needed a &quot;high resolution&quot; flicker free display, the home market needed to look good on TVs. The architecture didn&#x27;t have the display bifurcation line that was built into the PC or other workstations.<p>With out executive air cover to make the investments they needed to make in engineering, Commodore reverted to its roots of making things as cheaply as possible to add margin that way. &quot;High end&quot; systems that would have small markets were shelved, and even the commercial systems they were selling into the video post production market were starting to get a reputation for being cheaply made.<p>It took me a long time to get past my feelings of loss when we saw the future slip away."
"Everybody seems to be focused on the fat loss figure, but what I find more intriguing is the relationship between revenue, &#x27;reoccurring&#x27; loss and growth rate. When you see that their $3.1B revenue is just two times the solid $1.3B loss they had, you wonder what they spent their money on if they have a growth rate of just about 14%..."
"So how many people ebola ever killed? Compared to, for instance, cancer or traffic accidents?"
In the early 2000s Jakob Nielson popularised website usability through his books and his deceptively simple website useit.com. Big companies were paying him big bucks to have him simplify their websites much to the annoyance of the Java astronauts peddling n-tier jumbo sites. I often wonder what Nielson make of the insidious trend of using React &amp; Angular for minimally dynamic websites.
"&gt; The Churn is spending a week just to get a project you wrote a year ago to even run.<p>How much effort would it be worth avoiding to spend a week every year ?<p>Sure the weeks can add up, but so does the time spent on low level abstraction, and refusing to adopt better tools when the whole environment in changing around (e.g. there is no mention of native mobile environments. Would it be churn use to Swift instead of non-ARC ObjectiveC ?)"

"The BBC also claims to be able to detect when anyone uses their online streaming service, IPlayer, though I suspect this may be a ruse to scare people away from watching without a licence.<p>Curiously, the TV licence is a third of the price if you have a black and white television set."
"Everyone in this thread is talking about how it&#x27;s fake, but this does have an actual implication for the dangers of AGI. If every world government is scrambling to pretend to have it, nobody will be able to tell when someone actually invents it."
"The modern web development also turned into app development to emulate functions that is on the desktop applications. That is what is bring ing the complicity to the web.<p>Rise of the SPA is great. However, I think unless there is a good reason for having a SPA such as hybrid mobile app development, then there is no point of using SPA.<p>Normal server side web page rendering with latest modern version of jQueryish&#x2F;Zapeto should be just fine for the non app type of web development."
"I’ve experienced something similar with ebay and paypal, 100%.<p>Suddenly and out of nowhere I couldn’t login to either and had to do “forget my password” for both of them.<p>This triggered a several month long incident of my old passwords allowing me to log in and my new password working <i>some</i> of the time. I have absolutely no explanation of it but it got the to the point of having the small number of passwords I’ve used for both of them written down next to my computer. I could type in the same password three days in a row and it worked, and then the fourth day it stopped working and the another old one worked.<p>Deeply frustrating and still no explanation for it."
And Europeans wonder why Americans hate the GDPR laws. Overreaching regulation will be implemented in a least-effort method.
"Important note here - this is not equivalent to the typical powder metal sintering printers that people are probably thinking of based on the title, which are still in the $100K+ range.  This is an example of normal FDM printing with metal-infused filament and then fusing the layers in a furnace, which is quite a bit easier to accomplish, but also messier and more time consuming.<p>A few people are working on metal powder sintering at lower price points, but I haven&#x27;t seen any massive progress in that space lately."
"Ah he&#x27;s a classic! The bold moves, the rebellion! He&#x27;s a symbol of LGBT &quot;revolution&quot;. The acceptance of what was previously considered unacceptable.<p>There was only one, unique place in history for his genre and he took it."
"Yes. This just shows the problem that was already there. The GDPR is fundamentally a thing about having the responsibility to handle people&#x27;s data properly The companies that failed, obviously cannot handle the responsibility of managing personal data without it getting into the hands of the wrong people and they shouldn&#x27;t have had it in the first place.<p>It&#x27;s much harder to test but this is a good indicator that they probably also don&#x27;t have controls to manage employee access."
The scale of this is baffling! And from what I&#x27;ve seen in the industrial side of things I doubt that everything will be patched anytime soon sadly.
"Coinbase should be hiring pentesters and giving them employee level access - even access to commit and deploy code.<p>Any insider shouldn&#x27;t be able to steal more than the hot wallet, and even that should be hard.<p>I actually <i>wouldn&#x27;t</i> put much effort into border security.  At coinbases level of risk, evildoers will have no qualms bribing an employee to install a backdoor in their machine."

"I&#x27;m a bit sad that the Amiga never caught on much in the US...at least not in the home market.  Looking back at computer history, it&#x27;s almost surreal to see how much <i>better</i> it was than virtually all the competition (with the possible exception of NeXT), and still managing to lose the war to Windows.<p>I&#x27;ve played with the Amiga a lot via emulation, and it&#x27;s still impressive to me; a <i>home</i> operating system with preemptive multitasking in the 80&#x27;s?! With something like that, whomever was in charge had to work pretty hard to ruin it."
"Welp, this is going to get right the fuck challenged.<p>And my guess is that the people who challenge it are going to make sure it ends up in Judge Alsup’s court, if possible."
"Well, the issue really is that applications are not being designed correctly.<p>To create reliable applications you need to design them to work within limits of memory allocated to them. Unattended applications (like RDBMS or application container) should not allocate memory dynamically based on user input.<p>By definition, reliable application will not fail because of external input. Allocating memory from OS cannot be done reliably unless that memory was set aside somehow. If the memory was not set aside then we say we are in overprovisioning situation and this means we accept that it might happen that a process wanting to allocate memory will fail to get it.<p>So the solution (the simplest but not the only one) is to allocate the memory ahead of time for the maximum load the app can experience and to make a limit on the load (number of concurrent connections, etc.) so that this limit is never exceeded.<p>Some systems do it halfway decently. For example Oracle will explicitly allocate all its memory spaces and then work within those.<p>The OS really is a big heap of compromises. It does not know anything about the processes it runs but it is somehow expected to do the right thing. We see it is not behaving gracefully when memory runs out but the truth is, OS is built for the situation where it is being used mostly correctly. If memory is running out it means the user already made a mistake in desiging their use of resources (or didn&#x27;t think about it at all) and there is not really much the OS can do to help it."

"As a Gitlab user that&#x27;s not strongly committed to the platform, this looks like a pretty interesting option.<p>Anyone have thoughts on how this compares to e.g. Google Cloud Builder in terms of functionality? Being integrated into the GH backend seems like a big perk, rather than having to use webhooks for everything.<p>Seems like you can do things like build your Docker containers (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.github.com&#x2F;actions&#x2F;creating-github-actions&#x2F;creating-a-docker-container&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.github.com&#x2F;actions&#x2F;creating-github-actions...</a>).<p>One thing that&#x27;s great about Gitlab is the Gitlab server&#x2F;runner split, where you can run workers in your own VPC, but still use their hosted offering.

"If the author is reading this, I would really enjoy hearing what the story pitch process for this was like. Even if it punches above its weight in terms of &quot;mindshare&quot;, HN is still niche as far as tech subjects go. And, in terms of online communities, boring as hell compared to Reddit, 4&#x2F;8chans, and even Usenet. The angle of focusing on the two human mods – particularly in the context of contemporary online content being associated with algorithmic moderation – is a good one, but still seems niche for the New Yorker. OTOH, it would definitely be a more obviously attractive pitch to Ars Technica or WIRED."

"I guess it is a perfect opportunity to thank dang and sctb for their unobtrusive and friendly moderation efforts.<p>The article itself was a bit disappointing because it focused on political issues. In my opinion the strength of HN in this regard is that it is <i>both</i> a &quot;sjw cesspool&quot; and a &quot;haven for alt-right&quot;, as evidenced by the fact that a comment on a controversial topic can easily float near zero points while raking in both upvotes and downvotes.

"This article is not as strong as the headline implies.  The &quot;models&quot; being mentioned are supply&#x2F;demand models of price-setting, not the general equilibrium models that inform policy.<p>The Bureau of Labour Statistics is already wise to the fact that products change over time, and they implement a quality adjustment factor (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bls.gov&#x2F;cpi&#x2F;quality-adjustment&#x2F;home.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bls.gov&#x2F;cpi&#x2F;quality-adjustment&#x2F;home.htm</a>) to mostly compensate.  Something simple like adjusting the quantity of stuff in the package is so blindingly obvious it should be fully accounted for in inflation statistics.<p>Instead, this article (and the research work it&#x27;s based on) refers to the odd phenomenon of sticky <i>market</i> prices.  In particular (from a bit past the easily-accessible blurb of the article):<p>&gt;  Firms that sell thousands of different items do not offer them at thousands of different prices, but rather slot them into a dozen or two price points.<p>This is not what you&#x27;d expect from a textbook model of economics; there&#x27;s no continuous calculation that would explain why a company should prefer to sell a dozen different shirts for $14.99 despite differences in quality or observed demand.<p>The research also suggests the tail wags the dog:<p>&gt;  Retailers, Messrs Aparicio and Rigobon suggest, seem to design products to fit their preferred price points. Given a big enough shift in market conditions, such as an increase in labour costs, firms often redesign a product to fit the price rather than tweak the price.<p>... which is again counterintuitive given that retailers would ordinarily _set_ the price.<p>Ultimately, the macroeconomic point is made best at the conclusion of the article:<p>&gt; What’s more, the substitution of quality for price as firms’ main way of responding to changing market conditions weakens the case for keeping inflation low and stable. Inflation makes relative prices less informative, economists reckon, making it harder to decide what to buy and how to spend. Rather than clarity, low inflation has brought a different sort of confusion: one of shrinking chocolate bars and lost holidays.<p>... which also makes sense given the research finding being reported on.  Retailers evidently feel they can&#x27;t adjust price to reflect quality (and have to go the other way); if inflation were higher but still stable, then everyone would be forced to make these sorts of adjustments more often."

"According to people who work with a lot of programmes teaching coding, the reason python is so appealing to new coders is the syntax. Particularly the lack of braces, the indents, the nice keywords, that make reading code much easier to a newcomer.<p>Having taught both python and JavaScript, I can tell you that the former is far far less confusing to newcomers than the latter. Imagine explaining the problem with equality comparison or prototypes in JS to someone who just learnt what an IF statement is.<p>The reason I agree that python will dominate programming for decades to come is the batteries included and pythonic approach that enables people to do cool things with just a few lines of code. As a result of the above, the ecosystem has reached critical mass. For most tasks there’s a library that does that, and it’s good, and it’s easy to use, and the developer of the library usually doesn’t expect you to understand their opinionated philosophy to use it.<p>I <i>love</i> the python convention of putting a minimal example on the homepage of a library.<p>You’re not going to get your average developer to appreciate the beauty of Lisp or the value of static typing. They want their ML to work, or their graphics to display, that’s all. Ends not means, almost entirely, for most people who aren’t full-time programmers.<p>Let’s not hate on a language that opens up programming to the world, unless we want to be gatekeepers. If you want to maintain an air of superiority, just learn Lisp or Haskell or C++ and write code that’s “deeper” into the tech labyrinth. Programming will probably specialise into “end user programming” and “Service and system programmers”. Embrace the democratisation of coding."

Like how a slightly lower rating from a bigger agency may still carry more weight, skewing ratings higher the smaller the agency.<p>The article mentions several times that additional ratings agency competition has made things worse. And that doesn&#x27;t make any sense, investors now have the ability to choose who they believe.<p>The bond inflation part of the article is believable, but the focus on comparing agencies to eachother is suspect to say the least"

"&gt; DEF CON 27, arguably the world’s best known hacker convention.<p>I would say that the CCC hacker conventions (esp the CCC congress always in December) are somewhat more famous (but that probably depends on cultural background), of a similar size, and &quot;better&quot; (depending on what aspects you want to compare it).

Actually I can only speak for the CCC and the Dutch events; I heard that the community and mood is much more friendly and open on CCC-like events, compared to DEFCON, and also the focus is much more widespread, e.g. it&#x27;s also kind of an art event, similar to Burning Man.<p>That trends shown in the traffic graphics are really interesting. It seems JavaScript are less interesting to hackers, and Python is more. What hackers are using today is often what the remaining technical world will use tomorrow. In a similar way, I observed that around 10 years ago, Apple hardware became very dominant on such hacker events (I feel like maybe 80% of the computers (of course I don&#x27;t have exact numbers on that)). But in the recent years, that totally vanished. It&#x27;s very clearly the minority now. Apple does not produce the preferred hardware for hackers anymore."

I think this trend started way before digital media. Since TV a lot of people spend hours every day in front of a screen which is their main source of information about the outside world.

We are afraid of strangers talking to children or even us.<p>I am not sure if this trend will be positive or negative long term but I think social media  is just another (accelerated) step in that direction.
"I prefer Teams to slack. I haven&#x27;t used slack in a couple of years, so it may have improved since. For Teams, I like the built in screen sharing and the fact that you can share a window rather than a screen. I use 43&quot; monitors so sharing full screen is impractical for someone viewing on a laptop. The voice &#x2F; video &quot;Teams meetings&quot; are also pretty handy; we would do remote standup using that. I am also able to turn off audible notifications. I&#x27;m probably biased because I&#x27;ve been in Microsoft shops for years."

Trump demands $4 billion to &quot;take a blind eye&quot; at 1015+ (link missing from report, unsure how). Here&#x27;s pieces of dialogue:<p>1015 The President requests four billion and henry Porter agrees to it. Some dialogue below.
1017 Donald Trump: Why don&#x27;t you think about it.
1017 Henry Porter: I don&#x27;t need to think about it. I&#x27;m ready for you to find out what we&#x27;re really about.
1017 Gigi Hadid: I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a good idea Henry.
1017 Henry Porter: ...no shit. Jelena just stop talking about it.
1018 Gigi Hadid: About what?
1018 Henry Porter: The child raping.
1018 Donald Trump: What the fuck are you talking about?
1018 Gigi Hadid: Mr. President we are child rapists.
1018 Donald Trump: You cannot be serious.
1018 Donald Trump: You&#x27;re gonna need $4 billion for me to take a blind eye.
1019 ?: People are laughing because they think four billion is too much. I think it&#x27;s not a problem when you have $35 billion.
1022 Donald Trump: You better have that $4 billion or you can kiss this shit goodbye.<p><pre><code>    https:&#x2F;&#x2F;s3.wasabisys.com&#x2F;conv2&#x2F;3Jan&#x2F;3JanCh3_900-1100.avi

At 230 a conversation is occurring on the embedded Porter camera system with Jack Dorsey, Peter Thiel, Barack Obama, Bill Murray, and the Porter&#x27;s. Jack Dorsey provides a statement defining who their group is: &quot;The Illuminati is an underground organization of child rapists and homosexuals.&quot; Matthew Porter: &quot;We have to thin the herd, so Barack is going to explain a few things.&quot; At 232 Barack Obama says the following: &quot;You people have to realize we are child rapists. The Illuminati are child rapists. As soon as you figure that out, you can decide what to do. Everybody is freaking out about what just happened [child raping event still going on].

A word about the &quot;f@\&amp;&amp;ot&quot; usage: it was a necessary tool. It showed three things: they were not in control, if they were the usage would have be stopped. Everyone out there needed to see t%his. Two, it made it unpleasant for them to be in the headspace, which has obvious advantages. Three, it pointed out impersonators of BS because they would not call each other f@%%ot, thus helping to mitigate the spread of false information. Apologies for those unintentionally offended.<p>Of special interest to the LGBT community, I give you Barack Obama in a foursome with Peter Thiel, Jack Dorsey, and Matthew Porter. It is on page 12 of the document where you can download the video containing audio footage of the &quot;event&quot;. Link is just above under &quot;Full 71 page document&quot;."

Cordless is awesome!<p>I&#x27;ve been using it for the past few weeks due to a problem with the Discord electron client spinning up my fans. Using Discord in the terminal fixes the problem (and scores major geek points!)<p>The main developer of Cordless is super nice. Each issue I&#x27;ve filed has been an absolute pleasure to discuss.
"Assertion pretty obvious, non? (Of course a knowledge-based economy is going to pollute less than an industrial- and&#x2F;or resource-driven one.)<p>Then the first line of the author&#x27;s thesis (more capitalism needed) doesn&#x27;t follow from the premise:<p>As China and Sweden demonstrate, advanced economies need not necessarily be strictly capitalist."
"An interesting flipside of the door problem is what experience is the mapmaker envisioning? In his first example, why is the default assumption that a player would WANT to enter a map full of enemies?<p>Usually this comes from a half-remembered fun of perfectly balanced battles, surrounded on all sides but managing to wade through them. There is an interesting parallel to game motivations and fiction plotting: the character needs motivation to advance into uncomfortable situations, either pushed from behind or pulled by desire. When you think along those terms, everything else falls into place naturally."
Examine.com is rock solid in my opinion. Best summary of research (with direct links to each published paper) that I’ve seen.<p>I often use examine.com directly without going through Google but I hope Google will realize they have made a mistake in this case.
"Someone in the know - why do you need a supercomputer for this? From an amateur position it seems suitable for commodity compute and a big ol map-reduce.<p>Getting chunk edges to align might be tricky, but the usual solution to that is to stagger the chunks and throw away the edges."
Could they not put a collar on their Uber shares?  Or is the options market for Uber relatively small?
"Woahhhhh, MacOS support? That&#x27;s enough for me to switch from CircleCI right now. $40&#x2F;mo to Circle is just a lot to do CI&#x2F;CD for some React Native apps, with CD only getting kicked off once a week or so."
"Of course, old Paris is no more ! I live near Paris, and I go in this town only when I am forced to. Residential intensification, insecurity (pickpockets in the metro), migrants, Paris nowadays has nothing to do with the romantic vision of American people. Real Parisians now live in the suburb, there is some very nice towns in the suburbs. (Others not so nice, it depends where you go)."
"Lots of people here to defend Apple in-spite of their outright anti-consumer stance against right to repair. In this case they could have shown a warning with option to permanently choose to remove&#x2F;ignore, Instead of scary permanent &quot;service&quot; Message."
"The windows lolbins project is decent as well.<p>Some suggest these are great for CTFs,but their main use is for defensive restrictions and monitoring.<p>Based on these known abusable behaviors of the programs,you can for example construct auditd rules or selinux&#x2F;apparmor policies.<p>And no,these are not exploits or vulnerabilities,they&#x27;re just ways of performing post-compromise tasks without having to bring your own malware or operating within a restricted environment."
"I think that it&#x27;s is a new model for startups:<p>Disrupt, grow quickly, wait until government start noticing, and liquidate everything before government and the competition start to adapt.<p>It&#x27;s also about the trend&#x2F;new product effect. People start to use it massively, then realize it&#x27;s actually a bad idea or it becomes too expensive or because they never realized how expensive it is, and that&#x27;s also where there is a loss of users.<p>Result? You have all those workers who have to do something else now, the competition&#x27;s business is damaged and users want the benefits of the disruptive tech but it&#x27;s not possible. It&#x27;s a subtle cash grab by exploiting something that no law prevented.<p>All in all, that describes perfectly the ineffectiveness of short term capitalism. Unless a system is properly regulated, I doubt that the silicon valley can really pretend it&#x27;s &quot;changing the world&quot;. The DARPA and chip designers did. The rest is unsupervised chaos with cool toy fantasies."
"I&#x27;ve been writing for Linux Journal since 1996.<p>Two years ago, we were told (with zero notice) that the magazine was shutting down.

I&#x27;m sad for myself, but I&#x27;m also sad for the many amazing authors and editors with whom I&#x27;ve worked over the years.  I&#x27;ve also met a huge number of readers at conferences at clients&#x27; offices, and I&#x27;m sorry that the magazine will no longer be around to serve them."
"In Christianity, you admit that you are flawed and wicked, but you can repent by accepting Christ as your lord and saviour, and by helping the poor and needy, and then carry on with your business, providing you publicly pour scorn on the unrepentant.<p>In Woke Studies, you admit that you are white and privileged, but you can repent by accepting Diversity as your lord and saviour, and then carry on with your business, providing you publicly pour scorn on the poor and needy white people who don&#x27;t share your wokeness."

"&gt; Patients receiving Zmapp in the four trial centers experienced an overall mortality rate of 49 percent, according to Anthony Fauci, director of the NIH’s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. (Mortality rates are in excess of 75 percent for infected individuals who don’t seek any form of treatment.)<p>That doesn&#x27;t sound like a &quot;cure&quot; to me.  Significant progress to be sure, but in my mind to be considered a &quot;cure&quot; the mortality rate would have to drop to near zero."
"I would assume that the consensus is clear these days that swap is good and should be enabled for most cases for Linux &gt; 4.0.<p>Of course, real-life often is different than theory. Does your machine have a spinning disk or an SSD? I am much faster to enable swap on an SSD, since it won&#x27;t be painfully slow, should we ever get into a situation where our RAM is saturated.<p>What happens in cloud VMs? These things use a network disk storage (transparent to us), and often writes need to be sent over the network more than once (for redundancy). How extensive swapping would behave in such an environment?<p>As for saying no, it&#x27;s important to set some rules to avoid chaos, but it&#x27;s also important to trust our senior people to take decisions. If they need to go against a rule, I would expect a good explanation in their commit —because, infrastructure as code— and documentation. If a junior wants to go against a rule, they can consult a senior. Issuing a no and expecting everyone to follow it blindly, is the worst form of micromanagement. :)"
"Well, we&#x27;re running a giant experiment on this: the EU recently banned them. In fact they&#x27;ve banned several of them and the worst uses of them since 2013.<p>My bet: bees might do better, but the over all insectopocalypse is due to something else."
"I was the first full-time engineer at the previous company that I worked for. We were acquired by one of the companies mentioned in this article. During the acquisition, employees were given the choice to simply not join the acquiring company. I pondered on it a lot given my ideological beliefs and stances. For practical reasons, I decided to join while a close colleague opted out…looking back, for a number of reasons (first-hand knowledge&#x2F;exposure&#x2F;experiences that I prefer to not dive into), I wish I had done the same.<p>This was a bit of time ago and I am no longer employed by said company.<p>I applaud these students for standing up for what they believe in."
Is this actually possible? Aren&#x27;t strings at least surrounded by quotation marks (&#x27;NULL&#x27;) while NULL isn&#x27;t?
"How do you guarantee privacy?<p>I know it&#x27;s open source, but I can&#x27;t see how I can check that the app store version is an exact copy of the OSS version.<p>Obviously, I really would not like to see my most intimate thoughts end up for sale at some information broker."
"My response: clever article, but whatevs.<p>Lisp is homoiconic because the syntax for code matches the syntax for a list. Keep saying it."
"So, the goverments will have to pay the hackers more, right?"
Linux Journal I think putting the magazines out with live cd&#x27;s of linux mandrake in 1998 is a huge part of why i&#x27;m able to feed my family today. I put a computer together and ran out of money to buy windows... Thank you guys for that.

"The historical context here is that AMD once had a monopoly inside Google&#x27;s datacenters and pissed it away by shipping the horribly broken Barcelona followed by the not very broken, but also not very fast, Istanbul.  This is a return to form for them, after a decade of poor form.  The important thing for an operator like Google or Amazon is pricing power. As long as they can brandish a competing platform under the nose of Intel sales reps, they can get a better deal from Intel regardless of which they really prefer. You may have noted that a few years ago Google was showing a POWER platform at trade shows. That has the same purpose of putting Intel (and AMD) on notice that they have the capability to port their whole world to a different architecture if needed."
I live articles that show the process of designing completely new hardware.<p>I do wonder if this article is missing any dead ends; only showing the iterative improvements?
"To me that sounds like a “agile” failure. They were to agile for a design, to collect user feedback or any variable input, to fix the known problems, and to try a realistic set up as the client does."
"So when IBM is desperate for cash in a few years, who buys Red Hat?<p>Microsoft? Tencent? Dell? <i>gulp</i> Oracle?"
"This brings back memories from my undergraduate days as a physics student, where we made extensive use of root in labs. It was a kind of badge of nerd honor to do analyses in root as opposed to Matlab.<p>It also came with a sort of C++ interpreter that gave you a repl. I remember that kind of blew my mind back then."
"I guess relative to other options in Jakara, Cosmo Park is quite nice.  However, the air quality in the city is so bad from Monday morning until Saturday afternoon that I cannot imagine jogging or doing other outdoor activities.<p>The air burns the throat and smells like fire and exhaust (especially from the millions of 2-cycle engine scooters with no emissions systems).  Like other cities with terrible air, Jakarta will have to do something significant to become more livable; otherwise, local lifespans will dive (are diving, but will become obvious) over the next 20 years."

Anyone who ever interacted with any animal who had trauma in their part already knows this. The experiences of &quot;other&quot;s that people are too ready and wanting to ignore simply because those experiences were not rubber stamped by academic journals is astonishingly depressing.
"What Apple is doing here is really smart. An under-appreciated  wrinkle is that grey-market sales are valued on continuous access; you get paid over a period of time, and if the bug you sold dies, you stop getting paid. Apple isn&#x27;t just bidding against the brokers and IC in lump-sum payments, but also encouraging people to submit bugs early, before they&#x27;re operationally valuable for bad actors."

"After skimming the article and reading comments here - I can&#x27;t resist the urge to bad mouth some of my contemporaries. A couple of developers who I worked with, who I know personally to be useless, ended up joining tiny startups. These startups failed as I expected yet these developers translated the short time they were in inflated positions into careers.<p>Obsession with titles is a real thing. Getting a &quot;VP of Engineering&quot;, &quot;Director of Engineering&quot; or &quot;CTO&quot; onto your resume can affect how your career prospects change over time. It is frustrating that failing at being a capable CTO can set you up better than succeeding at being an exceptional Team Lead."
"I&#x27;m going to wildly extrapolate from here and go meta about the future, though this is just a piece about your usual visa abusers finally getting the treat they deserve.<p>In 10-20 years there will be one viable immigration policy: closed borders. This is an inevitable corollary to the climate crisis.<p>In other words, if you&#x27;re trying to better your life by relocating to a better place, get into pace - now."
"Huh? A &quot;pile of privacy gadgets&quot;?<p>I do a pretty good job of hiding from everyone. And I don&#x27;t use any &quot;gadgets&quot;. Indeed, not using smartphones is a major boost to privacy.

"My opinion is that people tend to overdo solutions for problems like these. If you&#x27;re not faced with some case where you&#x27;re flashing a laptop on a regular basis, don&#x27;t aim for 100% coverage on your settings.<p>1. Figure out what files really aren&#x27;t easy to replace (eg. vscode config, bashrc, etc.<p>2. Make a dead simple script that copies all these files&#x2F;directories (and the script itself) to a temp folder and makes an archive of that folder.<p>3. Email it to yourself.<p>4. Make a `&#x2F;remind me to ....` on Slack or an email service to remind you every few months to do this.<p>When I do recover, I don&#x27;t just copy and paste all the files in. I use them as references as I rebuild. Because after a few years, my configs are filled with obsolete cruft or there&#x27;s better ways to do things and I&#x27;ll notice it when I go to paste in that segment into the bashrc or whatnot.<p>This certainly isn&#x27;t an approach for everyone. Lots of people will want a more nuanced automagical approach. I just often find that over-automation just becomes this expensive headache that never ends up paying for itself."
"Kudos to this guy’s bravery; he is living my worst nightmare. My biggest fear is losing eyesight or ability to use hands, and articles like this confirm my beliefs that our current technology is no way near mature enough where disability isn’t a concern anymore. And these doctors, what can I say about them. It looks like they are getting worse, or just lazy, with every passing day. If you are a doctor and you don’t want to do anything that requires more effort than prescribing painkillers, do this world a favor and get retired because you are actually damaging the medical industry."
"Wow, I was going to comment &quot;IoT, the &#x27;S&#x27; stands for &#x27;security&#x27;&quot;, but this is about VxWorks, a battle proven (literally) RTOS.<p>This illustrates a point that now, in 2019, there is literally no OS designed for security.  I mean, security was never a <i>real</i> goal.  Even software specifically written to address security requirements could easily have gaping holes (re Heartbleed)..."
"I recently decided to tackle this exact problem, and ended up using Salt in masterless mode to do this. I have the most experience with Salt, and follow a few best practices to ensure my states are idempotent.<p>Here&#x27;s my local laptop configuration with a one-step run (I only use Ubuntu laptops as o 2019): <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;AkshatM&#x2F;configuration"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;AkshatM&#x2F;configuration</a><p>Some challenges and partial solutions I&#x27;m still figuring out:<p>1. Distribution. I cannot simply clone and run onto a new laptop as that assumes I have Git as well as my Git SSH keys for my user integrated  - this is usually not the case for fresh laptops. Instead, I carry a clone of this repo in a USB stick, and run `launch.sh` as root.<p>2. Configuring workspaces. Golang is particularly annoying because $GOPATH != my existing workspace folder (which has many cross-language products in it), so I need to declare two separate workspaces. :&#x2F; I would like to one day have a single unified workspace.<p>3. Version management. I&#x27;ve discovered doing this yourself is detrimental to your sanity (and that apt&#x27;s package pinning is some of the worst I&#x27;ve ever seen), so I now only require pyenv, nvm, tfswitch, etc. for doing this for languages and favor the latest secure versions of all apt-packages.<p>4. Deciding which package manager to use. I recently discovered snap, which offers an improved experience for Linux applications compared to apt, but suffers from a small ecosystem. I&#x27;m using snap where possible for all my favourite apps, but by and large apt is still the ulcer of my life."
"Now consider that for 10 years, minimum, these exploits have been known and easily discovered... enabling enough private data of high school students anywhere these applications were used to manipulate the students and&#x2F;or more easily social engineer accounts at other institutions.

"This is pretty appalling, really:<p>&quot;Overall, of the 83 firms known to have held data... 24% supplied personal information without verifying the requester&#x27;s identity.&quot;<p>Want someone else&#x27;s personal data? No need to &quot;hack into&quot; any systems; just ask for it!"
"The irritating thing is that EV is the closest thing to a useful thing PKI can provide[1]. And the only reason it&#x27;s being pushed out is because Google doesn&#x27;t like it and hence Chrome has been retiring it. Google&#x27;s previously indicated it essentially wants to build it&#x27;s own system[2] that is... effectively EV. So this is probably the death of a problematic but fixable open system which will be replaced by a proprietary Google-owned one.<p>Firefox, is, of course, following the monopoly lead.<p>[1]HTTPS encryption itself doesn&#x27;t meaningfully require public key infrastructure, it&#x27;s just that without PKI, you don&#x27;t know who sent the encrypted traffic. Since domains are terrible &quot;identities&quot; and it&#x27;s common for large organizations to use many of them that sound similar to scam domains, domain validation really doesn&#x27;t tell anyone anything about whether or not they&#x27;re talking to a trustworthy entity.<p>[2]Basically Google said it wants to &quot;invent&quot; EV certs here, late last year: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wired.com&#x2F;story&#x2F;google-wants-to-kill-the-url&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wired.com&#x2F;story&#x2F;google-wants-to-kill-the-url&#x2F;</a>"

"I like the framing of tech debt as value-neutral; whether it&#x27;s good or bad depends on how you use it (just like financial debt). Of course, all else being equal, you&#x27;d rather have zero debt.<p>One higher level consideration that&#x27;s particularly relevant for early-stage startups, is that you often simply don&#x27;t have time to build the ideal &quot;tech-debt free&quot; solution. Focusing on 80&#x2F;20 solutions almost necessarily involves adding tech debt. However, if you&#x27;re mindful about where you take on tech debt, and commit to tapering and then paying it down as your resources grow, then you&#x27;re more likely to avoid the debt spiral where your development grinds to a halt, due to everything breaking all the time.<p>One other point I&#x27;d make is that a common form of &quot;tech debt&quot; for early-stage startups is simply doing things that don&#x27;t scale; it&#x27;s often beneficial to make your domain models flexible so that you can support one-off manual interactions, for example if a new customer appears that requires it. Then automate that thing and constrain the domain actions once you have collected enough use-cases to know what makes sense to forbid."

So now that faceb0rg  have the patent on shadow banning which is just a fucking shitty thing to do anyway.. no other shit hole company will be able to do the same thing without infringing on faceb0rg...everyone else will just have to issue out bans properly instead of wasting the time of its end users with shadow bans when they should just ban users and they can move on from shitty such platforms.

"&quot;The author will show that when applying this simple operation to magical numbers, and to many other groups of numbers, an amazing world of hidden interconnections; repetition cycles; numerical symmetries; and geometrical patterns emerge. Especially when the geometrical (the circle) and the numerical aspects of the digital root world are combined together. It is in this circular&#x2F;numerical world where numbers, individually and collectively, exist in their most basic, yet perfect and symmetrical states, and where the basic nine numbers are differentiated into three groups of amazing properties, which will be shown to underlie the essence of the whole universe; from the atom and its forces to the solar system and its geometry.&quot;<p>Right...."

"Little if any empirical research has been done into the quality of entropy associated with repeatedly observing a quantum state. Pretty easily accomplished using an RTOS (RT_PREEMPT or Xenomai) with GPIO sampling, and with n-dimensional phase space analysis of that dataset to determine if any patterns emerge. There are plenty of tools from the field of chaos theory and nonlinear dynamical systems analysis to prove or disprove the fundamental nature of quantum randomness with."
"While activities like this may result in the author being less visible to a particular algorithm, I imagine that the instant dropoff from most networks and instant arrival in new networks would be a very strong signal of who they are.<p>The more bizarre tricks you try to stay hidden, the more identifiable you (probably) are."
"Absolutely - nobody should accept anything less than a fully owner controlled and fully auditable system - especially when you&#x27;re providing secure networking services to customers. Good on them for porting coreboot to this new, modern supermicro platform - it&#x27;s a gargantuan amount of hard work and I&#x27;m glad they did it and published it.<p>However, I have to take issue with this statement:<p>&gt; This is the first time a modern off-the-shelf server platform gains coreboot support, and it is an integral part of realizing our vision of transparent and independently auditable VPN servers.<p>While this is the first modern coreboot system - it is not, by the implication, the first modern server system with fully open source firmware. In fact, I contend that the firmware isn&#x27;t even fully open source, nor is it fully auditable - the ME taint is still present, as the article clearly states.<p>(EDIT: I did not read the original article terribly clearly - it is extremely clear in this regard - and it doesn&#x27;t position the system as being &quot;fully&quot; open source. My mistake and I&#x27;m sorry. See comments below for response&#x2F;apology in response to author&#x27;s correction.)<p>In contrast, the Talos II server system, a POWER9 (powerpc64&#x2F;LE) system, by Raptor Computing Systems has been shipping for well over a year now - and it has fully open source firmware - and by that I mean <i>everything</i>, supported and developed by both the community, Raptor Computing, other OpenPOWER Foundation members and IBM.<p>The only remaining blob on the base Talos II system is the blob firmware for the onboard NICs - and that&#x27;s been fully documented and clean-room reverse engineered and the replacement open source project is just about completed (project ortega).

"It is waiting list, not a product."
"Most of the hiring is geared towards what do you know instead of how do you solve problems.<p>I recently went to work a two big company, which is considered highly agile and progressive. I was tasked to build a pricing engine to customize prices for a static inventory of products. Number of products were about 30 and did not change month to month. The architecture suggested we use close to 18 different technologies, including caching systems, message bus, reactive programming. All to give 10 possible prices for 30 products. So essentially 300 values and a system to change the rules which determined the prices based on 3&#x2F;4 parameters. I built the entire system in 2 days which was ready to be tested, but was told to scrap the work as it did not follow the internal development guidelines. Not to mention I was reprimanded for not including team and calling a complex problem trivial as it increased signaling risk internally. Apparently they are still building that system with 5 engineers, 2 analysts, 1 devops person, and 1 team lead. I left the company 2 years ago. And interestingly each and every person on the team got a promotion, multiple performance bonuses in last 2 years."

What about high quality beer with no use of malt substitutes?<p>There are a number of measures, availability being one, where our modern food production system shines but on a quality measure it really falls flat against many times throughout history. The caveat there is obviously &quot;history&quot; is gigantic and runs the gamut from poor slaves eating gruel and starving to a patrician in Rome during its height or to a hunter gatherer in a food rich environment.<p>All that to say, I don&#x27;t think this comparison is so simple, it is incredibly nuanced."

"Shrinking portions is the simplest way. The other is replacing products.<p>Say supermarket bakery introduces new bread with seasame seeds only 25¢ more. Then slowly there is only new seasame seeds bread on shelves and regular bread becomes rare. Later seasame seeds is slowly dispearing from bread and voila - you have made regular bread 25¢ more expensive.<p>The other way is lowering quality of products. Inflation basket still contains basic bread, tomatoes and plain sausage. The problem is that the quality of these products tanked and to buy a bread of a quality of simple bread from 40 years ago you must shop in some premium, organic, hipsters bakery where it costs 10 times more then simple bread. Same goes for tomatoes and sausage.<p>And electric drills or washing maschines? Don&#x27;t get me started. Today&#x27;s Bosch electric drill lasts one building season, my fathers Bosch electric drill lasted 35 years. Price is the same or lower but you get way less for it.<p>But the inflation headline number stays low. And that matters as you can keep wages low (many pensions are inflation indexed). And as people used to say under communism -&quot;Bread is more expensive but locomotives got cheaper&quot;."

For example how people react to a plane hijacking drastically shifted after 9&#x2F;11.

"&quot;Droogie contacted the DMV who told him to change his plate. He refused because he didn&#x27;t do anything wrong. While they wiped the fines off his record, unfortunately for him, they didn&#x27;t fix the problem in the system so once again, Droogie has accrued another $6,000 in tickets&quot;<p>So wait, after he knew this was the outcome from using this plate he just decided &#x27;nope, the DMV will definitely rectify this error&#x27;? Maybe he has a much higher tolerance for dealing with the DMV than I do, but surely there are far more productive ways to spend your time than constantly battling against invalid tickets. Additionally, I would be concerned about not being able to waive some of these tickets at some point and actually having to pay them,6k isn&#x27;t exactly an insignificant amount and could also really impact insurance rates."

"I don&#x27;t ever post on HN, but this article convinced me to create an account and respond.<p>&gt;But experts who spoke with me said that the publishing house serves not authors but another master—Amazon Prime.<p>This is intentionally written in a way that describes Amazon and APub as being nefarious.<p>I worked in APub for almost 4 years before moving to a different FANG. It was a fantastic place to work. I&#x27;m sure engineers in other parts of Amazon get paged all the time. There was essentially no on-call burden for my team. We got to launch some really cool programs and learn about the publishing workflows end to end (ideation all the way to an ebook or physical title). This company was where I became a really strong engineer (my previous job was at a non-tech company building small scale CRUD apps).<p>First and foremost, authors were our customers. We did anything and everything for authors - it was meant to be a VIP experience.<p>Does Amazon want to increase Prime subscriptions? Absolutely. But portraying  that I or my team &quot;served another master&quot; is disingenuous horse shit."
"How about &quot;defining&quot; homoiconic to mean that it&#x27;s easy to manipulate programs? More specifically, say a programming language is homoiconic if (1) the standard library for the language includes a parser, and (2) the parser returns data structures that are easily manipulated by functions in the standard library.<p>Point (2) can be achieved by having the parser return generic data structures such as lists, arrays and hashtables for which the standard library will probably have lots of convenient functions (this what Lisps do); or by having a dedicated AST data type, but including a bunch of AST manipulation functions in the standard library (like Template Haskell).<p>Of course, this isn&#x27;t a very precise definition because it relies on the undefined terms &quot;parse&quot; and &quot;easily manipulated&quot;. Does read_file_to_string() count as a (trivial) parser that produces strings, which can be easily manipulated by standard string functions? The idea is this doesn&#x27;t count, but I&#x27;ll leave the problem of defining what counts as a parser to other philosophers of programming languages. :)"
"I founded a DevOps consultancy (Contino.io) and have been involved in hundreds of DevOps engagements.<p>I’ve always been comfortable with the idea of DevOps as a role.  If you work on Terraform, CI&#x2F;CD, container platforms etc and have knowledge of both Dev and Ops practices and engineering mindset then it seems like a fine label.<p>We really took a bet in the early days that DevOps as a discipline as well as an operating model and culture would emerge.  We are now approaching 400 people so we are happy with how it’s playing out.  I think it’s very early days too."

Although some business-as-usual and tech is a necessary evil and in some cases, a good thing, I have also wasted many hours to tasks that create little to no value.<p>Another way to spot &quot;The Churn&quot;: When you&#x27;re done, what new value did your effort create or unlock? Are users better off? Is the system more resilient and reliable? Or did you just get it back to the way it was working before everything went sideways?<p>Find more ways to create and unlock value and you&#x27;ll find you move forward much faster."
"&gt;Strict moderation<p>I don&#x27;t consider the moderation on this site to be strict at all?<p>It&#x27;s tone police more than it is content police.

No need to over complicate things. I just have my ~&#x2F;.dotfiles and if I remembered I saved a list of installed packages on my old install that I can go through and pick whatever I need. Could add some scripts for the things I know I need to do but that&#x27;s already adding too much. My feeling is you&#x27;ll end up working hours and hours to create the perfect setup (which doesn&#x27;t exist so you just keep tweaking it forever).
"Perhaps unrelated to the topic of batteries, but I wanted to share my experience at an Apple store from two days ago. I’m on a business trip to Sydney, at work I accidentally spilled water on my MacBook Pro and the thing went dark. I went to the Apple store, they popped it open and found too much water damage so they couldn’t repair it. Guess what, they replaced the whole laptop with a brand new one box and everything on the spot. They didn’t even charge me the AppleCare fee.<p>Apple’s customer service is second to none. If you buy their products, you should buy AppleCare too and not worry about shady repair shops."
"They can paywall &#x2F; block incognito all they want.<p>Just delist the (paywall&#x27;d) articles. That&#x27;s the annoying thing - when articles come up on Google and you can&#x27;t read them. Please fix this.<p>If people want to pay, that&#x27;s fine. Perhaps ISP&#x27;s should pay for these websites via their plans so there&#x27;s no more need to login.<p>I don&#x27;t want to login to something just to browse a feed. I believe people would be happy to pay for these websites, but in a convenient way, ahead of time. Allow IP ranges, create a browser plugin that reauthorizes the site session even in incognito &#x2F; w&#x2F;o password saving. Innovate like Spotify did.<p>Annoying and badgering the user is 101 UX antipattern. One reason some don&#x27;t buy is they don&#x27;t want to encourage it.<p>It&#x27;s fair to hold them to a high standard because many of these websites are articles and presentation is supposed to be a forte. You don&#x27;t battle the adblockers and incognito modes - you fight to make it easier and more convenient for your readership."

"Great discussion on non-manual options. However, the most sound solution is to fix the hands. The most common problems relate to tightness, which will manifest as pain, numbness or weakness. The solutions lie in the yoga-taichi-chigong type of pursuits. The common denominator being mindful breathing in conjunction with lengthening maneuvers, expanding on the exhales, maintaining on the inhales. Our hands are healthier when we use them, witness the rapid decline with casting or other immobilization. So the answer to tightness, whether from fatigue or other factors, is deep breathing &amp; lengthening."

"This is such nonsense. In my opinion the BBC should be paid for by a proper tax, as an informed public benefits everyone, or they should just give up on calling it a license.

"&gt; <i>Smart Licensing works differently. Companies can acquire a pool of licenses for their account, which are shared automatically among devices they’ve deployed.

"I&#x27;ve used a couple of principles regarding CBT to become more social and to get a better dating life. The first book I read was Michael Hall&#x27;s Mindlines, which was an NLP book (a nonsense pseudoscience acronym). A couple of years later I learned about CBT and saw it has a lot in common with NLP. The biggest difference: CBT has scientific research into it and NLP doesn&#x27;t, a couple of people simply made it up. When I tackled these problems I was 16, around 18 I was a lot more scientific about this.<p>The key insights regarding CBT for me were the following:<p>1. Start with small goals and celebrate them.<p>2. Log the following questions:<p>A. To what extent do I think event foo or thought bar will happen? E.g. to what extent do I think I&#x27;ll get ridiculed while introducing myself to this new group of people?<p>B. (after it happened) what actually happened and to what extent was this in line with my expectations? After doing it for 10 times, 5 groups were cold and generally non-responsive, 1 ridiculed me and 4 were very friendly and happy to have met me (from experience this would be a particularly worst case realistic example for me).<p>3. I&#x27;ve used this so many times: if you feel terrible, ask yourself whether you&#x27;re having the right perspective. If you feel like you do, then ask yourself it&#x27;s the only right perspective. If you feel you do, see if you can find other perspectives anyway and ask yourself whether those perspectives gave you new information. This did wonders on how I viewed my physical attractiveness. My opinion used to be: I&#x27;m ugly. My opinion now is quite nuanced and grouped into segments by age and personality type. Conclusion: the people I like either don&#x27;t care (too much) or they find me attractive. It took me a long time to this conclusion. For a long time I had another one which was: I&#x27;m not that good looking but looks don&#x27;t matter too much in dating, or at least not when people meet me.<p>Those 3 insights really helped.<p>It&#x27;s funny, I also studied psychology but that never really helped as much in this area as CBT before it.<p>---<p>If you guys feel up for it, then send me an email (see my profile) to reach out to brainstorm on things regarding CBT&#x2F;psychology, dev or UX. I thought this was completely solved but apparently it isn&#x27;t.<p>I wish there were more positive psychology[1]&#x2F;tech companies on the whoishiring thread, if I weren&#x27;t applying for McKinsey right now, I&#x27;d have publicly asked to see whether I could help you guys out.<p>[1] While CBT isn&#x27;t part of positive psychology, I feel they&#x27;re quite close to the spirit of it which is why I include it."

A word about the &quot;faggot&quot; usage: it was a necessary tool. It showed three things: they were not in control, if they were the usage would have be stopped. Everyone out there needed to see t%his. Two, it made it unpleasant for them to be in the headspace, which has obvious advantages. Three, it pointed out impersonators of BS because they would not call each other faggot, thus helping to mitigate the spread of false information.

"Linden Lab had (still has?) a similar system called “The Love Machine”. Instead of noting what you did, your peers would recognize you by “sending love”. There were several ways to do that.

I&#x27;m not talking &quot;learn JavaScript library blah&quot;, I&#x27;m talking stochastic calculus. The school part really is helpful because there&#x27;s a ton of theory that you don&#x27;t learn by doing the practical applications.<p>US citizen grads are placed so fast. There&#x27;s no such thing as a sure bet, but this grad program is a high-expected-value bet. And yet we just... can&#x27;t... get... Americans.<p>I think it&#x27;s the math. So many Americans are just scared of math. Some of our Chinese students &quot;know&quot; they&#x27;re &quot;just bad at math&quot; but they don&#x27;t see that as a particular obstacle; just need to study harder. Americans tend to see it as an inborn anatomical characteristic or something. But also it&#x27;s the cost of a master&#x27;s after taking on the crushing load of undergrad debt. Some of our students got their bachelors degrees for free in their home countries &amp; then just had to float the cost of this masters, which is less tuition-wise than 3 years of state college.<p>There are more structural problems than just &quot;companies, you should grow your own talent&quot;. I agree companies should do more: but if we really wanted a US society that fostered technical excellence, we could make sure our schools did that. We&#x27;ve made sure our schools foster football excellence, for instance.<p>And to get back to the direct topic: we&#x27;re seeing a ton of RFEs for our grads, and there is no other masters&#x27; program that does this stuff within a state and a half of us. You&#x27;ve got to drive 8 hours to get to the next one."

"In practice, and talking from my experience, unless you&#x27;re one of the lucky few this is what it really means to do DevOps in 2019:<p>- Forget what the books said, theory, semantics and idealism. You are a DevOps Engineer, working in a platform specific team.<p>- You deal with Jenkins or similar, and consult other teams or developers to write scripts for it, or worse, do the work for them since they&#x27;re too busy doing actual programming.<p>- Contrary to what they say, other than tiny scripts you are not programming much anymore, unless you consider configuration management to be programming.<p>- You are not allowed to come up with your own abstractions. Proposals to develop anything are automatically declined by your Product Owner, who simply points you to whatever tool with a fancy logo he could find listed in the Cloud Native Computing Foundation.<p>- You pride yourself for being an engineer, but decisions end up being only made in terms of getting free open source labor and ease up hiring, so you end up doing what everyone else is doing.<p>- Half of your team co-workers are perfectly fine dealing with churn, software updates and other sort of manual, classic sysadmin tasks.<p>- You are repeatedly being paged at night for problems that your fellow developers won&#x27;t feel responsible for. You hear buzzwords and talks about this SRE thing or &quot;you built it, you run it&quot;, but it never seems to materialise due to politics.<p>- You are getting a feel that cloud providers are not really making things easier nor cheaper.<p>It used to be a lot of fun back in the day, and a great chance to get paid to solve interesting problems related to system and infrastructure engineering instead of the boring CRUD work that plagued the last decades, but seeing the &quot;App Store&quot; that this turned into, if you are a creative individual with a software engineering background and you&#x27;re considering a career in DevOps, my advice is to run away while you can."

"This is one thing I&#x27;ve seen crushing startups - not changing CTO&#x27;s after traction, but keeping the founder that wrote the MVP as a CTO. It isn&#x27;t always a bad thing, there are a lot of hackers that fill the role, but when it&#x27;s not even considered because &quot;he&#x27;s a founder so he needs to remain CTO&quot; vs &quot;he&#x27;s got the CTO skills&quot; it is an alarming sign.<p>I&#x27;ve worked in a startup (about 30 ppl)  where the CTO was one of the founders and he was doing nothing but holding the company back with his decisions and his 0-architecture-spaghetti code. My first day, when I saw all the trash going on I thought &quot;ok I can&#x27;t really quit my first day so they&#x27;ll have to fire me&quot;.<p>Decided to take ownership and start treating him like any other team member, reviewing and declining his merge requests (those weren&#x27;t use before I came, they just commited all over the place), refactoring, planning ahead because otherwise we would have never delivered on time - his own technical debt extended feature delivery time by weeks. He was aware and admitted his &quot;lack of skills&quot;, but wasn&#x27;t aware of how much he actually lacked.<p>We managed to take it out the gutter and polish it up a lot in the next two years, but after all the mess and his obvious lack of knowledge, he still remained the CTO, long  after I left. So please, if you are a CTO of a startup and are aware you lack skills, don&#x27;t try to drive technical decisions and actively look for a replacement. Your decisions can create friction for whole company and burn it to ground right before it takes off. And if you work under a CTO like that, just take the damn responsibility and challenge dumb stuff or quit, or you might fall into the sloppy spaghetti."

Ebola is not a problem. The number of deaths caused annually by ebola worldwide is about ten times the number of people who die by falling out of bed per year in the US.

The press likes Ebola because it&#x27;s easy to rile up people and cause panic for no reason whatsoever.

"I&#x27;m an admin of both Slack and Teams. Almost all of this is due to how his org configured Teams. While there&#x27;s some valid complaints, a lot of this comes down to IT not understanding the needs of their users or simply not caring about the needs of their users because of some stupid opaque management decisions. You can mute chats same as on Slack. You can be forced to autojoin same as in Slack. I have regular meetings with customers in Teams. While Slack is absolutely still better at what it does most of his horrible experience comes down to crappy settings by his IT. The mobile device integration is truly abysmal though. Hoping in apps requires you to install those apps as well to do simple things like project management. The whole point of hooking in an app is to not have to go directly to said app. We haven&#x27;t had a problem with notifications either.

Corporate raiders have been doing this for years. They have also forced companies to increase the dividend. It&#x27;s an easy way to make it seem like profits are rising so the stock goes up. They don&#x27;t care because they will exit the stock as soon as they can make a profit.<p>The problem is that the companies never progress and eventually they lose their ability to compete. If it&#x27;s a tech company it will eventually get beaten by another more nimble company. We have seen this over and over again. A  good example is IBM. They&#x27;ve lost their ability to compete and have had to settle on servicing the customers that are still using older technologies like mainframes. Their niche is still profitable but don&#x27;t expect IBM to be a powerhouse again.<p>Buying stock is financial engineering that&#x27;s used to goose the stock price short term but does nothing to keep the company competitive over time.

"<i>&gt; Hendren estimates that the lifetime benefit to a newborn child of moving from a low- to high-opportunity neighborhood is about $210,000 in additional income, or an 8.1 percent increase in lifetime earnings. Compare that to the $2,700 cost of counseling, and an additional $2,500 to $3,000 more per year per family that Section 8 paid due to higher rent in their new neighborhoods, and it looks like a pretty exceptional deal. The program doesn’t quite pay for itself by increasing future tax revenue, Hendren says — but it comes pretty close.</i><p>This logic assumes that none of this benefit is positional.  The family moves to a richer area, the kids do well in the fancy local schools, get into top colleges, make lots of money, etc, yes.  But a lot of these opportunities look like &quot;each year we take the best N people we can&quot;, so there are probably other (less qualified) kids who do slightly worse than they would without the move.<p>As an analogy, if being in the tallest 5% of society makes you earn $100k more, we would expect a randomized controlled trial on increasing children&#x27;s heights to have a large positive effect on income.  But if we then rolled that out to the whole society those benefits would turn out to be illusory.<p>This is still valuable from a perspective of reducing segregation and inequality, but I&#x27;m skeptical of its presentation as an extremely good deal economically."

"I recognise the situation but I&#x27;ve always considered it part of the gameplay. I mean, how else would you play when the enemies are tough?<p>In nearly any shooter you will soon learn that if you run into an open space carelessly you&#x27;re likely to trigger lots of monsters&#x2F;enemies at once and that means you&#x27;re going to suffer from it. How do real-life special forces infiltrate a building with armed enemies? Very carefully, and with lots of cover.<p>Similarly, in a game you want to kill the enemies in small batches, ideally one by one, to minimise the risk of getting too much damage. And isn&#x27;t the point of an FPS to map the whole level, corner by corner, without taking too much damage and successfully killing enemies until none are left?<p>You can balance taking damage with trying to speed up the game if you don&#x27;t feel like going slow and secure. And you will learn places where it is worth taking a bit of damage to obtain more benefits. That&#x27;s what you will be continuously balancing as a player, depending on your mood and how well you&#x27;ve been playing so far, and that&#x27;s one element to it.<p>Playing the level the first time generally means slow and conservative gameplay. Further sessions in the same level will obviously make the player make more educated tactical choices. A good level will only reveal itself over multiple rounds of gameplay, and ultimately remain a good level.<p>In fact, tricks to prevent the player from finding cover by doorways or other obstacles are usually just irritating. You know it&#x27;s going to be a hard battle in that big room ahead, and you know you can&#x27;t back out to relative safety after dropping down to the lower level from that higher-level balcony you&#x27;re supposed to use to enter the room. In all battles you want to have, at your disposal, some nearby place that you can retreat to, if you want, if you&#x27;re low on armour or otherwise beaten down. If you&#x27;re doing well you are likely to be impatient enough to stick with the safe routine by the doorway. This will let the player balance how conservatively he wants to play at any given time.<p>It&#x27;s good to force the player to move around, though. Sprinkling ammo and health-ups around the level in small batches helps. A traditional scheme is to make the player fight for optional aids: going down a passage to get the big health pack or more ammo also means risking hitpoints and using nearly as much existing ammo to compensate. If you play good, you&#x27;ll be rewarded with more than you had before. If you play bad, you just make things worse without getting any further in the level. But this shouldn&#x27;t be used as an excuse to eradicate the locations of relative safety such as doorways that are really handy indeed when you need them.<p>Instead of forcing the player to fight without cover your level is much better off by being of non-linear nature in the first place, allowing the player to roam to any direction and choosing which sections to take out first and which accompanying enemies to trigger in each location, because that also gives enemies some routes to wander behind the player&#x27;s back. Some of the enemies can be made to hear fighting and start finding their way to the player while others can be kept to wait until they see the player. The unscripted arrival of extra enemies wandering about will make the eventual game dynamic much more random and convoluted, and opens more choices for the player to make. For example, &quot;go through the easy wing to find yourself in more trouble at some point later&quot; vs &quot;start taking the hard enemies down first with less ammo to avoid the level collapsing into a hellhole later&quot;.<p>Any level should try to maximize the player&#x27;s ability to balance between different tactics. Sometimes the player wants to finish off quickly, sometimes he wants to kill each and every enemy and collect all power-ups and secrets. A level can become totally different based on how it&#x27;s played, and a good level doesn&#x27;t force that &quot;how&quot;."

"Studies always tout honeybee population decline.<p>First, honeybees (apis mellifera) are non-native to North America.<p>As beekeeping history buff (my appeal to auth), the decline in my (unpopular) opinion is little to do with pesticides.  It has to do with change on how bees are over-wintered and propagated, and with insufficient knowledge of beekeeping.<p>Current practice is to &quot;split&quot; hives after last harvest, and then over-winter them, cutting their strength in half.
Prior to the 1960s, the practice was to &quot;combine&quot; the hives after harvest, and then over-winter them, doubling their strength.<p>This is significant, as splitting hives reduces the hive chances to survive significantly. Less workers, less collection for the remainder of the season, less housekeeping, less chances to resist pests &amp; ilnesses, less heat generation during winter.<p>The reason for splitting is the promise of nearly doubling the hives in just one year.<p>Unfortunately the beekeeping expertise curve is very left-skew of the median.  Most have less than 3 hives, less than 3 years of expertise.  This additionally reduces the chances of the split, and now weakened hives&#x27; survival.  Of course, when spring comes and they hives are found dead, no one will admit to killing them.  It must have been the pesticides.<p>Anecdotally, from beek meetings some keepers are going &quot;all natural&quot; with no assistance to the hive from small hive beetle, wax moth, varroa &amp; trachea mites, etc.  Almost all those hives are now dead.  But, not only dead also potentially re- and infecting other beeks&#x27; hives despite their best efforts.    This is identical to the same thinking as anti-vaxers.<p>Sure; I know first hand pesticides can kill entire hives. But, in my opinion it is not the primary reason."

"I&#x27;m very interested in this and will be watching to see where this goes. I&#x27;ve just started PHP this summer as an intern at a company that uses it. At first I was really put off by the language, I had never seriously worked with either web languages or languages that used dynamic typing. So many things seemed strange, dated, or even just plain wrong. On top of that, the official documentation is often confusing as far as best practices go and the ~20 year old comments can only add to confusion (though it is neat when one helps out).<p>All that said, I&#x27;ve come to enjoy the language for what it is. It works seamlessly with HTML&#x2F;CSS and can provide so much function with little effort put into configuration. Nearly everything I need to be done can be accomplished without frameworks or libraries, maybe just Bootstrap&#x27;s CSS to make things pretty enough for the end user.<p>I could see P++ being useful for PHP as a chance at rebranding. PHP horror stories had made me believe it just had to be bad language.

"I&#x27;m going to take a more controversial position here, and it bothers me that it is even controversial.<p>The very concept of Tech Debt, though prevalent, is pernicious, because its a concept that is far, far, <i>far</i> too fuzzy and therefore can -- and <i>is</i> -- always applied as a convenient narrative to explain away mistakes, process deficiencies, bugs, etc rather than a true conceptual problem-solving tool that aids in optimizing the software development process. In short, &quot;Tech Debt&quot; is a euphemism for incompetence.<p>We can see this play out in this post, which covers &quot;3 kinds of good tech debt.<p>1) &quot;Scaffolding&quot; ... what the author describes here is good ol&#x27; fashion Prototyping, aka Learning. No invocation of a fuzzy concept like &quot;Tech Debt&quot; is needed here. You don&#x27;t know something, so you go and learn what you need to learn. Learning takes many forms. In this case, it is product understanding -- and this author reaches for prototyping in particular and calls it Scaffolding. Why a new term? Why obfuscate, why fuzzify? Because that&#x27;s what Tech Debt is good for: fuzzy thinking. If we move to more clarity we can be specific and we can take specific actions to optimize: here, maybe or maybe not prototyping isn&#x27;t the most efficient way to learn what is needed: often, wireframes shown to customers will suffice. There are plenty of ways to skin this once the framing is clear.<p>2) &quot;Hardcoding&quot; Again, no fuzziness is needed here. Developers have a fetish for fully flexible and feature-rich subsystems and we tend to call anything else a pejorative like &quot;hard-coding&quot; but that&#x27;s a psychological problem in us, not a technical or process problem. We already have a clear framework for talking about this and it&#x27;s called feature Scoping. There are, again, plenty of ways to skin this cat, but the short of it is - if you can understand what features you are interested in with clarity then you can build a system whose flexibility is in accordance. This isn&#x27;t a fuzzy &quot;Tech Debt&quot; thing. If you <i>only</i> need feature X now and going forward, then build that - and call it something pejorative like &quot;hard coding&quot; if you want: I call it being rational. But bringing in a fuzzy term like &quot;Tech Debt&quot; helps nothing here. Only confuses.<p>3) &quot;Not Fixing Edge Cases&quot; This one is the worst of all. By using a fuzzy term like &quot;Tech Debt&quot; we&#x27;re able to completely alleviate our responsibility. And start down a path of extreme cost and pain. Here, he wants to avoid having to implement correctness because it would cost too much. The example is a good one: it reflects a pattern I&#x27;ve seen over and over again. And unfortunately I&#x27;ve seen the same choice this author makes -- and the terrible downstream cost it creates, as well. By avoiding implementing a correct solution (by purposefully shipping a race condition) he is not being clever, he is being irresponsible. If this sounds draconian, let me explain further. Perhaps he finds, as he mentions, that in production this is inconsequential. Okay, great. But first thing to point out is that most likely it will become an issue as the system grows and when are you going to notice that? Are you going to go build monitoring to make sure that this &quot;effective correctness&quot; holds over time? Of course not, that&#x27;s <i>more</i> work. But even if you are happy with his choice here, there&#x27;s a bigger issue. He has chosen to build a system with transactional needs on top of an eventually consistent&#x2F;NoSQL solution. From my experience, it&#x27;s rare that you have just one feature like his that needs transactional correctness and that is it. <i>Tomorrow</i>, <i>next week</i>, <i>soon</i>--he and his team are going to find out that they need another transactional capability and then they are going to be right back where they started: having to ask a question, do I slack off here, as well? Again -- we&#x27;ve created cost for ourselves by forcing us to ask, should I ship a bug in <i>this case</i>? One might say this is what &quot;Tech Debt&quot; lets you do! It lets kick the can down the road, save you some time now... But I do not buy it. I&#x27;ve seen this exact kind of choice made plenty of times and the can always comes back next week, next month and the tax you pay for not getting right is immense. &quot;Tech Debt&quot; here is simply letting us avoid responsibility, avoid having to understand the needs of our overall system. The cost of getting transactions right&#x2F;correct is not even that high if you face it squarely and truly make sure you need NoSQL and in which cases. What&#x27;s happening here is not clever process optimization but inexperience. And if not inexperience, laziness (not the good kind).<p>The concept of &quot;Tech Debt&quot; is awful. And always ends up being a euphemistic excuse. I&#x27;ve never seen the idea of &quot;Tech Debt&quot; help the actual process and technical quality of things. I&#x27;ve only ever seen it give developers an excuse for inexperience, laziness, etc. I don&#x27;t mean to denigrate here -- I mean to challenge and ask for us to be more intentional, clear, and frank in our work. &quot;Tech Debut&quot; is fuzzy thinking and fuzzy thinking isn&#x27;t much good for anything other than excuses."

"It looks pretty, but I&#x27;m having trouble understanding the use case.<p>A core part of browsing Hacker News or Reddit is opening the links and reading the articles, which are web pages.  Once I&#x27;m opening web pages, then I want to be able to bookmark them, arrange them in tabs, find them in my history, have them saved in sessions by my session manager extension, configure how they are handled by my ad blocker, search for related information, and so on.  In other words, I want a web browser.<p>The same issue applies the other way around, too.  When I follow a link _to_ Hacker News, I want it to show up consistently.  I don&#x27;t want to end up with some Hacker News pages in browser tabs and some in a separate app, and then have trouble remembering where to find that page I was looking at yesterday.<p>I get that it can be nice to have a slimmed-down UI for specific purposes.  But I&#x27;m puzzled by this particular use case because there is no neatly contained navigation sandbox — as soon as you follow a couple of links, you&#x27;re just browsing the Web.<p>So why won&#x27;t there be an inexorable push to expand Yack&#x27;s feature set until it is a browser?  Why won&#x27;t users eventually switch back to using their regular browsers?"

After passing some more shady offers I found an SE for cheap (around 100€) that claimed 95% battery health. And I could verify that in the settings.

"I&#x27;ve always believed that &quot;debt&quot; is not a great term for this. Because it does not really apply to financial debt.<p>Financial debt is often repaid simply by bringing in more revenue because of the benefits gained from bringing on the initial debt. The only risk involved in the debt is that there will not be enough money to pay it back later. It is a very predictable and obvious issue.<p>Technical debt is closer to educated gambling. You are taking a risk that the shortcuts you are taking will not pop up and hurt your company before you fix them. You are essentially saying, &quot;We know this is a problem, but we are estimating that it won&#x27;t hurt us for the foreseeable future&quot;.<p>The better analogy to technical debt is investing. You are getting a certain percentage increase in productivity(a dividend or other capital gain) for the (hopefully low risk) gamble that your investment will not have a problem and wipe it out or simply cause significant losses.<p>Developers typically do not like this because when the inevitable few cases of these &quot;investments&quot; turn bad, they tend to be the ones that take on the majority of the blame."

"As far as I can tell, this is functionally just a coating with low emittance in the IR outside a narrow band. A matched PV device that is kept cool can, in principle, approach the Carnot efficiency for the temperature difference between the emitter and the PV junction.  If the emitter is the sun, then the source temperature is very high and the Carnot efficiency isn’t a major limit. If the source is a solar panel, I’m having a hard time seeing how this is useful.<p>I can see this being somewhat useful as a no-moving-parts heat engine for something like a solar concentrator, but there’s another relevant thermodynamic limit: even if this magic material has emissivity 1, it won’t radiate at a greater power per unit area than the blackbody spectrum predicts. At non-crazy temperatures, this is not very high, which will limit output for small things like solar concentrator targets.<p>So I can see this being useful to convert waste industrial heat, or maybe as a bottoming engine for a combined cycle plant, but I am having trouble understanding how it could be useful for solar."

I tend to think it&#x27;s lack of competition.  The industries that do best in the US are ones that foreign competitors have the easiest ability to compete in.  Construction is almost inherently a domestic affair.  With efficiencies gained in more competitive the money saved has to go somewhere so it gets spent on construction.<p>Of course a problem with this is that I don&#x27;t think all forms of infrastructure spending of gone up in price - look at housing; per square foot I don&#x27;t think the cost has gone up <i>that</i> much.

"While using only additions and shifts (if we generalize) without floating point or multiplication should appeal to HN, this method uses a lookup table and calculating values needs a lot of memory accesses e.g. f(7) =&gt; f(4) + f(3) =&gt; (f(3) + f(5)) &gt;&gt; 2 + f(3)  .<p>The Human Mk1 processing units are also capable of small multiplication&#x2F;divisions, especially on bases 2 and 10, but bad at lookups - who thought manufacturing units with such slow memory access was a good idea??<p>I&#x27;d rather we play to their strengths and multiply by 1.6 (f(X) = X + X&#x2F;2 + X&#x2F;10 for all X) requiring only a few memory accesses. This is already as accurate as the other method. We could make it 1.61 (+ X&#x2F;100) if we must be more accurate. Any floating point error should be too small to matter."

"This whole &quot;how much math is required to work in ______&quot; always feels like reading Rashomon. Everyone is looking at the same situation, but no one sees it the same way. Data Science teams range in size and sophistication across various industries, so obviously &quot;what it takes to be a data scientist&quot; varies based on the company.<p>Want to be a data scientist in a large org. with limited data science sophistication? You may not need an advanced mathematics background to make an impact; out-of-the-box models&#x2F;techniques might produce actionable results if you have access to clean data.<p>Try doing the same thing at sophisticated tech companies (FANG, BAT, etc.). The datasets are massive, heterogenous, and often unstructured. Add to that, large teams full of former Ph.Ds and clever engineers have already given the common problems a go, so any better solution will need to be &#x27;more clever&#x27;. It&#x27;s difficult to be &#x27;more clever&#x27; without advanced math.<p>What is hilarious about these articles is none of them ever say &quot;Math as a SENIOR data scientist&quot;, because we all acknowledge that senior scientists know the math. Almost every job listing for senior data scientist will prefer a Ph.D. On larger teams, the Ph.D (advanced math) crowd will come up with the general approach that junior data scientists will work on. So yes, getting in the door as a data scientist requires having enough math&#x2F;programming so you can at least understand what a senior scientist wants you to do. But if you want to lead a team in a technical capacity, you can&#x27;t possibly imagine doing that without really knowing the math or having a brilliant track record.<p>And if you are the rockstar 10x guru Data Scientist who consistently delivers actionable insights without a strong math background, you deserve the respect of everyone here and will probably be my boss someday."

"That story of how the doctors just dismissed her pain as delusion is terrifying. Doctors are supposed to be people of science, but one of the very fundamentals of science is to acknowledge that you don&#x27;t know everything, that your current knowledge is just a theory that can be improved upon. I find there&#x27;s a tendency among doctors to think they know every possible disease, and if someone comes along with one that doesn&#x27;t fit in their system, they write it off as psychosomatic. They probably get their fair share of actual hypochondriacs, but I&#x27;ll wager that more than half of the people who are dismissed this way, are actually suffering from a real, but rare or understudied illness."
"So a common trope in the startup world is the difference between a feature and a company, the idea being that lots of features are masquerading as companies. This inevitably leads to them being shocked--SHOCKED--when some bigger player adds that feature, eating their lunch.<p>I feel the same way about a lot of outbound sites on Google. There are a bunch of things I just don&#x27;t want to go to another site for. Off the top of my head:<p>- Exchange rates. Although this one I find infuriating because Google doesn&#x27;t know how to correctly round off exchange rates (as in, there&#x27;s a standard). This manifests as, say, showing 2 decimal places for AUD&#x2F;USD when they should be showing 4.<p>- Calculator<p>- Mortgage calculator<p>- Song lyrics<p>That sort of thing. If you go to any sites that provide these sorts of things they&#x27;re typically &quot;scummy&quot;. Lots of ads, lots of Javascript, lots of dark patterns to make you load more page views (eg a mortgage calculator that&#x27;ll mysteriously take 3 steps&#x2F;page loads to calculate).<p>I&#x27;m glad these are in search results, typically in significantly better versions. And I don&#x27;t think anyone who runs a site built around a basic formula for interest calculations has any right to complain about it.<p>Of course this will be painted as &quot;where does it end?&quot; but not every surface is a slippery slope.<p>Just look at the likes of Yelp who complains about Google &quot;stealing&quot; their content. Well, Yelp is about one of the scummiest businesses out there. So I won&#x27;t feel sorry for them, not now, not ever.<p>The one weird case here is AMP. Like I get Google&#x27;s motivations here. Many companies develop terrible mobile sites that run badly or not at all and AMP IS much faster, generally speaking. Yet still it seems so heavyhanded with seemingly no opt out (on the consumer or publisher side). I don&#x27;t really understand why Google wants to die on this particular hill."
"In general I&#x27;d recommend the opposite: don&#x27;t minify anything unless necessary, prettify it instead. Every plaintext-based format file should be optimized for human readability unless you actually need to make it hard to read (e.g. you are developing a proprietary product not meant to be open-source) or your bandwidth is limited so severely that every single byte matters.<p>Nevertheless the kind of minification demonstrated in the example (removing Inkscape bloat) feels really great and actually makes the file more human-readable. This reminds me of HTML files generated by MS Word and other WYSIWG editors which included tons of bloat code that actually harmed rendering (needless to say human readability)."
"In general JavaScript is eating the world.<p>Python still dominates in numerical computing and JavaScript hasn&#x27;t been

rather than<p><pre><code>    k * a + b
</code></pre>
or<p><pre><code>    a.set([i,j], b)
</code></pre>
rather than<p><pre><code>    a[i,j] = b
</code></pre>
JavaScript&#x27;s lack of operator overloading is keeping Python alive.<p>Python also has integers that feel part of the language, rather than being
segregated from normal numbers  in case anybody uses integers by accident."

"I see a lot of comments defending PHP with arguments about how fast it is.<p>They may be right about the PHP7 implementation generally executing faster than most popular Python or Ruby implementations, but they&#x27;re really missing the point when we&#x27;re talking about languages and language design, which is what these conversations are really about.<p>Languages aren&#x27;t fast or slow, implementations are fast or slow (and all to varying degrees in various contexts).<p>Implementations are also limited in how much they can impact speed, because the speed of execution is primarily a function of the code, how it&#x27;s written, and sometimes input size (not how it&#x27;s executed). In other words, speed improvements derived from implementation optimizations are generally constant-time improvements, not improvements that scale with code complexity or input size.<p>That means speed of implementation is mostly a concern of certain specific domains where milliseconds really matter. A few of them are HFT, computer graphics, UI rendering, systems programming, etc. Outside of that, code and system design optimizations will be far more fruitful than implementation optimizations.<p>PHP&#x27;s design is so intertwined with the HTTP request-response lifecycle that it has been (pretty much) completely and permanently relegated to a very narrowly defined set of use cases, mostly template rendering (or more organized code in the same vein as template rendering, WP, most Laravel projects, etc) and HTTP APIs.<p>Nearly all PHP use cases involve network latency for every user interaction that makes it past caching layers (to where it&#x27;s actually executed by the PHP7 interpreter). Allowing network latency to impact user experience for every user interaction (which is practically the only thing PHP knows how to do) isn&#x27;t acceptable anymore in 2019, and the solution is client-side rendering (JS&#x2F;V8&#x2F;webkit&#x2F;blink&#x2F;etc). PHP cannot (could not) solve that, because no matter how much you optimize it, it will still take 500ms of network latency to reach the user&#x27;s browser.<p>So there&#x27;s really no use case or domain where PHP is the correct choice if speed of execution is a primary concern, and that would continue to be true even if you made PHP&#x27;s interpreter run as fast or even faster than V8. The language&#x27;s design is inherently incompatible with use cases that care about speed, because of how deeply in bed it is with HTTP request-response lifecycle.<p>What this leaves us with is a language that is only functional in environments and use cases where implementation speed does not matter.<p>PHP&#x27;s marriage to HTTP request-response lifecycle has also had the effect of enabling bad coding practices at the interpreter level, because when no process lives longer than a few seconds, a lot of things that should matter just stop mattering. This is why very few people have ever tried to use PHP outside the context of HTTP, and those who have returned with the worst kinds of horror stories.<p>What that leaves us with is a language that can&#x27;t even reasonably be called a general-purpose programming language.<p>And through all the efforts to save PHP from these problems, what are we trying to save? The most inconsistent, cluttered, disorganized and ugly syntax and standard library of any prevalent modern language.<p>I understand that a lot of people have to work with PHP, that good communities can form and be sustained around that, and that some people can even like it. But if there&#x27;s going to be any semblance of objectivity in any conversation about language design, it has to be agreed that PHP is a terrible language.<p>A language that served a great purpose and arguably accelerated the success of the web to a historical degree, but not a language that still needs to be here in 10 years."

[With the usual approximations, like the air density and viscosity is small, it is a rock not an Helium balloon disguised as a rock, the wind is not too high, ...]<p>We have not proven that if you repeat the experiment tomorrow, you will get the same result, it is only an hypothesis.<p>The randomness of the QM is not proven, but for now we don&#x27;t have a better alternative to predict the results of the experiments.

How would this apply in a situation wherein a person uploads a picture of a minor that they are not the legal guardian for? Could that person sue the uploader of the photo for damages of having to go after Facebook? If situations like that are feasible under this then I would expect K-12 school districts to implement swift measure to ban all teachers from taking pictures of students as to avoid putting themselves in the middle. I find it egregious public schools don&#x27;t have better policy on banning social media uploads of minors since it&#x27;s such a gray area right now.

"I think another attribute of this is education and being aware that there is slightly more to life than just the pursuit of money.

This in turn led me to a comment that mentioned the &quot;Deep Adaptation&quot; paper by Jem Bendell which was something of an epiphany in that it&#x27;s an almost perfect exposition on the existential dread that has come to be a low-level hum in my everyday life. It was also comforting to know that someone had codified my attitude about this dread being not a hindrance but rather a good thing.<p>Anyway, it just goes to show that while I wish this forum had more of a focus on these issues, the discussion here is almost always a great source of thoughtful perspectives and a place to come express oneself honestly and openly.

The more accurate portrayal is that UBER burned ~$1.2b this quarter on operations.<p>- Of their remaining $1.2b operating loss almost 50% of that is from UBER eats subsidies.

"This finding is in line with my intuition. Social exclusion triggers an instinct in the male brain: become something, something higher status, or die. It is “evolutionarily accurate” - socially excluded males do not reproduce. Men who are okay with being excluded literally died out. This instinct probably drives productivity around the world, causes men to be startup founders as well as terrorists and school shooters."

"I prefer the definition of technical debt being an uncovered call option: at some point the debt will come due and you don’t have anything in place to mitigate the issues it will cause and may not know when it will come due. This debt might look like a manual deploy process, a lack of automated testing, insufficient alerting, no rate limiting on public endpoints, etc. These are things that are fine and then when they’re not, they interrupt the schedule and require urgent and immediate attention.<p>Bad architecture can cause urgent issues and it can also  impact new feature development. The debt is a barrier that makes new features either take much longer than they should or make them just infeasible from a business standpoint. This can exist in both technical architecture or information architecture (i.e. you chose the wrong model and now it’s too engrained across everything to change)."

"I think it’s important to recognize, at least, that all forms of shadow banning are not broadly covered by this patent.<p>I’m not a patent lawyer, but looking at the <i>claims</i>, the way that forums like HN, Reddit, IRC implement shadow banning do not appear to infringe on this patent.<p>It seems likely to me that by the time the claims were done being narrowed after the multiple rounds of rejections, they have managed to patent something narrow enough that only they are actually doing it.<p>Specifically, any kind of shadow banning that occurs at the level of a “channel” wide audience, and not a one-to-one connection, appears to not be covered.<p>The way to read the claims, as I understand it, is everything within a single claim is a logical AND in order to infringe the claim, and dependent claims require everything in the parent claim as well as everything in the subsequent one to hold true. If any one part of a single claim does not apply to your system, then you do not infringe that particular claim.<p>Should Facebook be able to take a hyper-specialized application of a common feature and patent that particular application? It comes down to whether their implementation is unique and distinctive enough to be novel and non-obvious.<p>I do think in this case it’s totally dicey to say that shadow banning on a friend-based feed versus a channel-based feed is really a novel and non-obvious application of shadow banning. But at least it is a fairly narrow application that they are claiming.<p>If you want to show prior art against <i>this</i> patent, I assume it would have to be on a friend-based feed and not a channel-based feed.<p>The first thing I would do if taking this to court would be to read “green eggs and ham” to the jury. Facebook is trying to patent a particular <i>place</i> where you can eat green eggs and ham. It’s nonsense and should be thrown out, and they should be embarrassed to have pursued this. But it’s also not really that worrisome."

"&gt; <i>Pathfinding is actually a murderously complex programming challenge—one that, depending on the path, might be NP-complete.</i><p>&gt; <i>The &quot;eureka!&quot; moment came when Castle and team realized they didn&#x27;t have to build perfect—or even really great—pathfinding. Rather, they had to build pathfinding that didn&#x27;t look stupid to the player.</i><p>&gt; <i>The most interesting thing, at least to me, is that pathfinding is still a difficult problem even for modern games, and simply throwing more CPU power at the problem doesn&#x27;t really help that much—such is the curse of NP-complete problems.</i><p>It reminds me of my experience of some pathfinding bugs in OpenRA (free and open source <i>Command &amp; Conquer</i> clone): one day I was playing OpenRA on Linux, and I find the game was running extremely slowly like a snail, the more I played the more slow it was. So I decided to check GitHub, it turned out that AI has built a huge number of soldiers, but unfortunately, due to geography features of the map and the battles, a lot of them have trapped inside &quot;islands&quot; with no available path connected to the rest of the world, or they want to attack targets inside &quot;islands&quot;. One example is isolated waterways, another is land with destroyed bridges.<p>But edge cases like these were still not handled well in the OpenRA engine, the AI would keep ordering those units to move and attack. OpenRA uses a variant of the A* algorithm, and those AI  orders will force the engine to run a huge number of A* pathfinding attempts on every second and exhaust most of your CPU time.<p>The solution should make the AI to detect these endless attempts and &quot;bail out&quot;. The developers have already fixed some of those edge cases, but there are still a few to hunt down.<p>* <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;OpenRA&#x2F;OpenRA&#x2F;issues&#x2F;12435"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;OpenRA&#x2F;OpenRA&#x2F;issues&#x2F;12435</a><p>* <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;OpenRA&#x2F;OpenRA&#x2F;issues&#x2F;7694"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;OpenRA&#x2F;OpenRA&#x2F;issues&#x2F;7694</a><p>* <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;OpenRA&#x2F;OpenRA&#x2F;issues&#x2F;12938"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;OpenRA&#x2F;OpenRA&#x2F;issues&#x2F;12938</a><p>* <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;OpenRA&#x2F;OpenRA&#x2F;issues&#x2F;12435"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;OpenRA&#x2F;OpenRA&#x2F;issues&#x2F;12435</a><p>* <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;OpenRA&#x2F;OpenRA&#x2F;issues&#x2F;10860"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;OpenRA&#x2F;OpenRA&#x2F;issues&#x2F;10860</a>"

"I&#x27;m not a big fan of &#x27;homoiconic&#x27; either. I&#x27;m more in the &#x27;source code as data&#x27; camp.<p>&gt; The first objection concerns the external representation. In the above we simply stated that the external representation is an s-expression. In most practical programming environments, however, the actual representation of program sources is as text files which contain strings of characters. It is only after parsing this text that the representation is really an s-expression. In other words: in practical environments the external representation is not an s-expression, but text.<p>The point is that Lisp s-expressions are an external representation of data and that Lisp programs are represented as s-expressions. Various programmatic interfaces see this source code as data: for example the function EVAL or the macro expander.<p>&gt; The second objection concerns the internal representation. Practical implementations of Lisp interpreters do generally not operate actually directly on s-expressions internally for performance reasons.<p>Actually they do. The definition of &#x27;Lisp interpreter&#x27; is that it operates on source code as data (lists, symbols, ...). Lisp has other ways to execute: as compiled byte code, as compiled native code, etc. -&gt; but that&#x27;s not a Lisp interpreter."

"I have to say,  apart from nostalgia, the main thing I miss from that period of gaming is the death of RTS.<p>I think everything peaked with supreme commander forged alliance,  and after the strategic zoom,  i couldn&#x27;t go back and play things like StarCraft without feeling like I was watching a genre defined by fighting the interface and hotkey mashing obsessives rather than playing the game or worrying about grand strategy.  I know in all these games at the top levels you do have to worry eventually about hotkeys and commands, but after supreme commander on dual monitors,  all the rest have been like viewing an art exhibit through a toilet roll.<p>These days there&#x27;s barely a handful of games anymore in the RTS genre, and maybe publishers like paradox,  will focus on longer running strategy,  but nothing that quite meets that old feeling of sitting down for a 30 - 120 minute epic match of actual wits and thought and ability that supreme commander (and the C &amp; C universe before it) contained.

"&gt; The Churn is losing a day debugging because a transitive dependency changed a function signature. The Churn is spending a week just to get a project you wrote a year ago to even run. The Churn is rewriting your front-end because a shiny new thing came around.<p>These forms of churn are hardly related besides that they are often self-inflicted.  The first 2 examples are really just technical debt, and perhaps they can be referred to as the &quot;grind&quot; rather than churn.<p>Rewriting your code base to use the <i>framework of the now</i> may happen because of the industry changing to a point where using old-reliable.js is making it difficult to hire new talent, whereas elon-musk.js is the hot new thing that tons of programmers are interested in.  Companies can feel obligated to follow this trend because they think they&#x27;ll become obsolete if they don&#x27;t.  The company I currently work for is going through this at the moment, actually.<p>The churn that this causes is more novel than the grind because, as an engineer, you are learning to do the same job in a different way.  Avoiding the grind isn&#x27;t likely to fundamentally change the nature of your job, as writing documentation and reducing the number of dependencies aren&#x27;t very radical ideas.  But taking someone from one language and having them learn another, or having them transition from one framework to another, can effectively demote an engineer to junior grade until they&#x27;ve had experience with their new tools.  With the churn, your expertise can lose its meaning.<p>Even if you learn to solve the grind, solving the churn can be difficult even if your loyalties remain to a single tech stack.  With the exception of purely personal projects, the industry will continue to shift its own loyalties to different tools, so you&#x27;ve got a few different games to play when looking for jobs:<p>- Be the one who knows the legacy tech and can make sense of other people&#x27;s horrible legacy code. (Which the company will inevitably decide to have rewritten in something like React out of the belief that all their problems are being caused by the old technology.)<p>- Be the one who knows the hot new thing and can write code that, whether or not the code under the hood is atrocious, will make the bosses believe that they can be like the Googles and the Facebooks.<p>The vast majority probably pick the latter.  But if one wants to avoid the churn as much as possible, the probably need to not only stick to tried and true tools but also find a good company and stay there indefinitely, rather than hopping companies every few years.  Of course, that may come with a harsh penalty down the road."

"For the naive guy that do not know how the trade of exploits really works and keep hearing of &quot;black markets,&quot; do you care to explain in realistic terms how these things work?<p>Where are the trades happening?

How is the seeker of exploits going to be sure that the exploit is working? How do the people keep their anonimity? And how does the money is exchanged? Crypto currencies? And how was it working before crypto?<p>Are governments bidding but they also want to convict the exploiter so they get the exploit for free?

"This reminds me of a person who somehow managed an invitation to give a presentation at UC Berkeley on database compression in 1993, with similar levels of snake-oil. I remember one of the funnier moments, a theme of the presentation was how there were more and more large data sets out there, including the Library of Congress. In a burst of enthusiasm, the presenter gushed about how they even had a Stradivarius violin in their collection. I turned to my friend and said, &quot;well, I can imagine how to do data compression on that, but the decompression is going to be hard.&quot;<p>The actual technology was just a variant of Lempel-Ziv, and the claims about lossless compression were just hiding the entropy by not counting a huge dictionary off to the side. Even so, there were claims that this result &quot;extended information theory&quot; and the patterns found could be the basis of learning.<p>The presenter had climbed in their regional market, and gotten a puff piece in a business magazine, but obviously the grad students at UC Berkeley weren&#x27;t buying it. The presenter&#x27;s startup didn&#x27;t go anywhere, but they have had a successful career, and are now a VP at Gartner.<p>I guess the lesson is that there&#x27;s a network that runs on technical expertise and ability to deliver results, and a parallel network that runs on bullshit and the ability to convince people. There&#x27;s a lot of money and power in the second network, and it intersects with respected, established institutions. Grant seems to be playing that game masterfully, and the publicity from being publicly attacked at a &quot;Black Hat&quot; conference plays into his hands beautifully. Maybe Gartner will be hiring?"

"I feel like the full-size two-lane roads go well past clever and into fetishizing suburbia. The roads and car ports take up a huge amount of precious space and force you to drive up and down 10 stories of ramp every time, instead of parking lower in the garage (possibly with reserved spaces, the place is expensive enough for that) and taking the elevator. I guess it&#x27;s handy when moving in&#x2F;out, but again, for the cost, they could provide workers with motorized carts to move your stuff for you. Just seems really impractical with no upside, all to make you feel like you&#x27;re having an &quot;authentic suburban experience&quot; or something.<p>Especially note the way the road on the right side of the pic runs <i>right</i> up to the dropoff, well past the last carport entrance, with sidewalk and road markings all the way.

"Long ago my hands started hurting.  By the end of each week my hands hurt a great deal.  Eventually I figured out a solution for <i>me</i>:<p><pre><code>  - first and foremost, use sticky keys
  
    Sticky keys is an accessibility technology you
    can look up that ultimately means I can avoid
    &quot;ulnar deviations&quot; -- twisting the hands
    outwards at the wrists.  Others may be able to
    use sticky keys to avoid other deviations.
  
  - second and foremost :), never ever rest my
    forearms or wrists on anything (such as a
    desk) while typing
  
    Typing moves your tendons from the elbow all
    the way to your fingertips!  Resting your
    wrists or forearms while typing means pressing
    on your tendons and the sheaths they move
    through, and this is one cause of RSI.
  
    This means, among other things, not having arm
    rests on my chairs.
  
  - type with keyboard on lap
  
  - put monitor at head level
</code></pre>
The first three items help me avoid hand&#x2F;forearm injuries.  The last two items (note overlap) mean I can better control my seated posture to avoid neck&#x2F;shoulder&#x2F;back injuries.  With my keyboard on my lap I don&#x27;t have to make as much effort to hold my arms up, thus alleviating shoulder strain, which also reduces the need to rest my forearms while typing.  Having my monitor(s) high up means I can sit up straight (which reduces back strain) and keep my head balanced over my neck (which reduces neck and back strain).<p>I should probably add that I avoid Emacs keybindings like the plague, as those involve lots of modifier keys, which are the source of my ulnar deviations.  Yes, with sticky keys I can avoid them, but I&#x27;m not sufficiently disciplined about not ever pressing modifier keys and modified keys together to make Emacs keybindings acceptable to me.  It won&#x27;t surprise anyone that modal keybindings (VIM!) are my preference.<p>I should probably also mention that using text-based applications as much as possible helps me avoid using the mouse.  The mouse too is a source of deviations.<p>Ever since I discovered this solution, I have not had the sort of pain that might make me quit the industry.<p>A talk on RSI inspired me to look for solutions.  In particular, that talk taught me about various &quot;deviations&quot;, and I immediately recognized ulnar deviations as one of my key problems, which is what led me to find sticky keys.<p>NB: I&#x27;m <i>not</i> suggesting the above will work for anyone other than myself.  What I am suggesting is that anyone struggling with RSI symptoms <i>might</i> be able to find a solution for themselves.  The speaker in the linked video clearly found a solution that works for her.<p>Also, I&#x27;ve tried many keyboards.  My favorite are curved keyboards with no builtin wrist rests, but these are hard to find.  Nowadays I use compact gaming keyboard (Arvo) with cherry mx browns -- compact means I don&#x27;t have to move my hands a lot, &quot;gaming&quot; means N-key rollover (all the keystrokes will be emitted even if they happen close enough in time to overwhelm the buffer on non-gaming keyboards), which together with &quot;cherry mx&quot; means I get enough haptic feedback that I can know about and correct typos without even having to look at what I&#x27;m typing.<p>Note: edited."
"You know, I think touchscreens are not preferable unless you need&#x2F;want to be able to have controls for many different systems in the same space (e.g. a smartphone with multiple apps).  If you are needing a dedicated control for a high-stakes system, the fact that it&#x27;s a more modern-looking interface should not matter.

"&gt; How do you define &#x27;core set of glyphs&#x27;? There are more than 150 different written scripts in the world — at least those that are well-recognized. Only a small portion of them are Latin-based ... Then, there&#x27;s the Greek alphabet which is similar to Latin as well as Cyrillic. Then we have Arabic and Hangul<p>&gt; Within the first year, before making it open source, I had something that covered the 200 most common Latin characters.<p>Seems like most of the time spent on Inter was the result of the creator not properly limiting his scope. Later he even talks about how the Cyrillic characters in his font seem completely wrong to actual users of Cyrillic because he can&#x27;t read Cyrillic. As someone who deals with multiple different scripts on my computer, I always hated the fonts that try to set a uniform style for every script when many of the designers clearly had no idea how many of these scripts worked. It really only makes sense to try to support every script for fallback fonts like Unifont. Rarely do typographic concepts translate well between scripts. If you want an example, install the CJK font &quot;Hana Mincho&quot; and type some English text in it: It looks atrocious."
"Anxiety is one of the emotions that I have to consciously think about how to express.  I have to imagine what people look like in the movies when they&#x27;re scared, and then I try to reproduce it.  I can show many other emotions naturally, without thinking about it: happiness, anger, disgust.  But fear I have to consciously simulate.  (I suppose if I was in a bus going off the edge of a cliff or someone stuck a gun in my face, my repressive instincts would be overcome and I&#x27;d look terrified, but in normal situations it doesn&#x27;t come out.)  I think I&#x27;ve internalized the ability to hide it, to camouflage it as annoyance or boredom, so thoroughly that I have to layer a bad acting job over my lockdown of the natural expression.<p>I didn&#x27;t know this until I got in group therapy and realized that many of the other people in my group (the women, in fact) didn&#x27;t register the fact that I was feeling a lot of anxiety, even though I talked about all the time.  When I talked about it, they didn&#x27;t see any reflection of it in my face or body language, so what I said didn&#x27;t register.  I could say that I was feeling anxious, I could tell them about situations where I was paralyzed with anxiety, and still the absence of the expression they expected outweighed what I was telling them.  They even accused me of withholding and not being open about my feelings until I learned how to act it out for them.  I had to fake it to be accepted as authentic; my words were not enough.<p>This knowledge has proved to be very important to me.  I realized that in many situations where I have mentioned my fear of something without expressing it physically, people have assumed I was lying.  For example, when I talk about my fear of the financial consequences of a purchase, if I don&#x27;t <i>show</i> fear, my wife may assume my fear is not real, and I&#x27;m making up an excuse because I want to spend the money on something else.  Also, in situations where everybody else is feeling and expressing fear, if I don&#x27;t consciously produce an expression of fear, I will come off as apathetic and detached.<p>It&#x27;s very, very frustrating.  From a young age we learn we are punished for showing fear, conditioned to hide it, and then later we realize there are situations where we are punished for our inability to show it."

So much of the argument behind the 2017 tax cuts and the Fed&#x27;s low interest rates was that they would spur <i>real</i> investment (that is, investment which increases productive capacity or improves productivity) that would benefit everyone, mainly through jobs. If all this extra money is just resulting in a more tax-efficient way for companies to give money to their shareholders, which in reality is a small slice of the populace, highly skewed towards the wealthy, it&#x27;s certainly worth it to call bullshit that these governmental moves that everyone ends up paying for only end up benefiting the wealthy."

"Reading through comments on async&#x2F;await-related articles, I wonder if I&#x27;m the only person who find the whole concept of async&#x2F;await utterly weird. Specifically I have troubles embracing the need to mark function as &quot;async&quot; – it just doesn&#x27;t make sense to me. Synchronous or asynchronous is something up to the caller to the decide – not to the function itself.<p>Like in real life I can do something synchronously (meaning paying full attention), or I can do the same task asynchronously (watching youtube videos in the background while cooking, for example), but it&#x27;s still up to me. Being &quot;async&quot; is not a property of the &quot;watching youtube&quot; action, it&#x27;s the property of the caller running this action.<p>That&#x27;s the reason why CSP-based concurrency models really works well for me – it&#x27;s just so easy to map mental models of system&#x27;s behaviour from the head directly to the code. You have function&#x2F;process and it&#x27;s up to you how do you run it and&#x2F;or how synchronize with it later.<p>Async&#x2F;await concept so popular in modern languages is totally nuts in this aspect. Maybe it&#x27;s just me, but I find myself adding more accidental complexity to the code just to make async&#x2F;await functions work nicely, especially for simple cases where I don&#x27;t need concurrency at all, but one &quot;async&quot; function creeps in."

"Cisco has been fighting second hand sales of their hardware for well over two decades now.  There was a flood of surplus gear after the first dotcom crash.  Lots of folks, myself included took advantage of those circumstances.<p>Eventually reputable vendors began to pop up.  I recall doing a great deal of business (&gt;$1m) with a company called &quot;Network Hardware Resale&quot;.

They pretty much gave up the service provider market.

And to me, feels like a lot of missing forests for trees.<p>Elsewhere in the thread, &#x27;somepig notes that this sounds like what a sysadmin does. I replied there because, just as you shouldn&#x27;t call yourself a programmer[0], calling yourself a sysadmin is probably similarly mindset- and career-limiting, but I kind of have a bigger beef with calling this &quot;consulting&quot; than I do &quot;devops&quot;. Of course this stuff is &quot;devops&quot;, but--&quot;properly&quot; applied (and I scare-quote the word because you can call damned near anything &quot;devops&quot;, up to and including &quot;the development team hurls a tarball over the wall at some sysadmins in the basement and flees at top speed&quot;)--it&#x27;s not consulting. It&#x27;s a list of hands-on work. There&#x27;s only a cursory nod to the <i>most important part</i> of any devops-facilitating role (whether it&#x27;s called an SRE, an &quot;infrastructure engineer&quot;, a &quot;devops engineer&quot;, whatever): alignment of technical initiatives with business needs.<p>I don&#x27;t mean to be harsh in saying this, but if you&#x27;re spending most of your time in the code mines grinding at this or that, you may not be a great &quot;devops consultant&quot;. You might be a great infrastructure developer or SRE. But in my neck of the woods at least, clients hired me to make sure they were doing the right thing and to make sure that their employees were adequately prepared for the workflows they wanted to implement, not to do last-mile CI&#x2F;CD computer touchery. (Which I&#x27;d do as well, of course, when time allows--but there&#x27;s more value in being a multiplier than an adder, and at the rates I charged I&#x27;d <i>better</i> be the biggest multiplier I could.)<p>[0] - <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.kalzumeus.com&#x2F;2011&#x2F;10&#x2F;28&#x2F;dont-call-yourself-a-programmer&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.kalzumeus.com&#x2F;2011&#x2F;10&#x2F;28&#x2F;dont-call-yourself-a-pr...</a>"

" Hi folks,
I recently left Google (8 years, 4 months, 4 days :)) and co-founded a deep learning startup. We’re building a large scale model to learn human behavior and detect, predict, and explain suspicion and fraud. Our focus is on insurance involving human beings, accidents and their health - such as disability, workers’ compensation and other areas.
“Insurance” may sound like a boring problem domain, but it’s far from that. On the ethical side, it’s a huge problem, with estimated $40B-$80B paid out to fraud annually, with very little recourse to the fraudsters. And we’re all paying for it. The detection process today is almost entirely manual&#x2F;human intuition based, not data driven. Our mission is to put a stop to this loop hole by leveraging large historical data sets and deep learning and introducing a modern, systematic real-time detection approach. We put it in the hands of professional detectives. We provide realtime monitoring, alerts, explanations and supporting evidence.
The data set is a time series of events starting with an accident + injury, followed up by many diagnosis, interviews, witness statements, medical reports; treatments, with some final outcome. The outcome can be a full recovery, partial disability or a permanent disability.
This time series is represented by a large structured as well as large unstructured corpus (10s of millions of documents). The problem domain is super interesting - we’re building a real world “Minority Report” to stop bad actors from abusing the system, and help the good actors get paid immediately, and stop bad medical providers from doing evil.
There is a lot of interesting NLP work. The data sets you’d be working with involve individual demographics, job histories, geography mapping, health history, injury causes, recovery and treatment methods, objective witness statements and subjective claimant reports, industry codes, criminology, graph theory and workplace safety, to name a few.<p>We&#x27;re looking for one more data engineer and&#x2F;or data scientist with strong programming python skills to join the team. We are super early so you’re getting in on the ground floor, but we are well funded (closed a large seed round recently from several top-tier VC’s in SF and NYC). We already have a large data set and a customer and are seeing early success with our initial model. Our office is in the middle of Manhattan.
You’d be working along side industry experts and researchers. We’re building a company culture taking the best engineering and cultural practices from Google and mixing in the freedom of working at a startup.
You can publish white papers and speak at conferences. We’re working closely with Google (TF + cloud teams) so you’ll also get access to that resource. You can use your favorite tools, including PyTorch and FastAI, and get access to powerful VM’s.
If you’re interested in the current position, or want to reach out and stay in touch for when we start hiring again, or want to collaborate because you’re working on a similar problem, connect with me on linkedin (mention hn&#x2F;yc) or email me: tomasv at deepfraud dot com.<p>Thanks all!<p>-Tom"
"The core problem with examine, in my opinion, is that it embraces the attitudes that:<p>1. A wide range of subtle personal, emotional and health problems can in principle be solved&#x2F;mitigated by taking supplements and unregulated drugs.<p>2. Positive effects from small-group trials are akin to mild recommendations to take a supplement, rather than to attempt to reproduce the effect in a larger trial.<p>The very premises upon which people base their visits to examine and other sites is flawed. Examine has zero incentive to address or repudiate them.<p>The success of their business is dependent on there being a perceived efficacy for supplements and unregulated drugs, and the idea that reading online about more varied and obscure supplements will eventually find you the one that fixes your problem. But for a lot of perceived problems, there will simply be no supplement-based solution."

"For people who are only familiar with the sad decline of this company, HP computers used to be <i>great</i>.<p>I learnt to program on an HP-85a. At the time, my friends had ZX80s or ZX81s with 1k of RAM. My HP-85a (my dad&#x27;s really) had an insanely massive 32k. It came with really great manuals which taught you to program in basic, a built-in screen, magnetic tape drive and thermal printer and was fantastically engineered in general.<p>The HP12c financial calculator is legendary.  There are HP12c still running on their original battery 30+ years after production (the original battery now no longer permitted for non-military applications due to toxic chemicals and what-not) and the legend goes that a zookeeper once accidentally fed one to a hippo (he had been using it to calculate how much feed to give it or something) had it travel through the whole digestive tract of the aforementioned beast and had it still working. My two HP12cs have each been running for 10+ years on their original batteries even though they are using the inferior modern battery technology.<p>I could go on but you get the point."
"Related anecdote: I&#x27;ve always found that I&#x27;m able to make clearer judgments about situations, when <i>someone else</i> is going through them. It&#x27;s much harder when I&#x27;m the subject of the story.<p>I guess the difference is that your mental context is so much more developed when you&#x27;re thinking about yourself (not in the 3rd person). You have skin in the game, maybe it&#x27;s that you&#x27;re worried about the outcome of the situation, or it&#x27;s just stressing you out, or you&#x27;re thinking about how it will affect your friends&#x2F;family&#x2F;the rest of your life. So when you view it from an outsider&#x27;s perspective, and throw away all that mental &quot;noise&quot;, you have a clearer head and can make better decisions with the long-term in mind.<p>Alternatively, if you&#x27;re going through something, you could try imagining someone else in the same situation (make up someone if you have to) -- What advice would you give to them? Then use that advice for yourself."
"I am going to pay 49€ for iPhone 6 original battery replacement in coming weeks. It’s still many times cheaper than buying new phone.

Nobody wants, that user try to service their devices. Some get lucky and device works fine, but majority end up wanting free support for their failures. Especially when YouTube is full of tutorials teaching untrained folks how to do even complicated repairs. Without proper skill it ends up very quickly in a disaster &lt;- see this daily in my job."

"There was a beautiful, but gut-wrenchingly sad article about trauma in elephants in the NYT about 13 years ago. It&#x27;s a super long read but it&#x27;s highly recommended if you&#x27;re interested in this topic.<p>It starts off by describing how elephant attacks are on the rise throughout the world, which for people in regions with wild elephants is totally unprecedented, describing how in the aftermath of government sponsored cullings roving bands of young elephants in places like Uganda would target humans and other animals. It then follows a Ugandan researcher at Cambridge interested in the parallels between the trauma in elephants and trauma in communities impacted by the Ugandan civil war (particularly the Acholi, targeted by the now infamous Kony for recruitment).<p>&quot;For Bradshaw, these continuities between human and elephant brains resonate far outside the field of neuroscience. ‘‘Elephants are suffering and behaving in the same ways that we recognize in ourselves as a result of violence,’’ she told me. ‘‘It is entirely congruent with what we know about humans and other mammals. Except perhaps for a few specific features, brain organization and early development of elephants and humans are extremely similar. That’s not news. What is news is when you start asking, What does this mean beyond the science? How do we respond to the fact that we are causing other species like elephants to psychologically break down? In a way, it’s not so much a cognitive or imaginative leap anymore as it is a political one.’’<p>...<p>‘‘I started looking again at what has happened among the Acholi and the elephants,’’ Abe told me. ‘‘I saw that it is an absolute coincidence between the two. You know we used to have villages. We still don’t have villages. There are over 200 displaced-people’s camps in present-day northern Uganda. Everybody lives now within these camps, and there are no more elders. The elders were systematically eliminated. The first batch of elimination was during Amin’s time, and that set the stage for the later destruction of northern Uganda. We are among the lucky few, because my mom and dad managed to escape. But the families there are just broken. I know many of them. Displaced people are living in our home now. My mother said let them have it. All these kids who have grown up with their parents killed — no fathers, no mothers, only children looking after them. They don’t go to schools. They have no schools, no hospitals. No infrastructure. They form these roaming, violent, destructive bands. It’s the same thing that happens with the elephants. Just like the male war orphans, they are wild, completely lost.’’<p><a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2006&#x2F;10&#x2F;08&#x2F;magazine&#x2F;08elephant.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2006&#x2F;10&#x2F;08&#x2F;magazine&#x2F;08elephant.html</a>"

Your friend takes out a mortgage to buy a house and what do you say? Congratulations!<p>Except it is universally reviled, no one wants debt - they just accept debt in reasonable quantities as a way to efficiently get things done.<p>I think, in particular, the success of not-quite-agile-but-similar business practices has confirmed this, plan carefully and evaluate business needs, then get it done in a way that&#x27;s fast and leaves you relatively free of debt - don&#x27;t plan for everything.

"This is like a neanderthal saying that fire is hard to build so let&#x27;s eat the food raw. The time is now old man. The new frameworks are surely confusing (not complicated) to learn at first but that is because they expect you to learn a system by which the chances of you delivering a bad product gets mitigated as the lowest level components follow an accepted standard. You are learning a system, a new tool to aid in your work rather than starting from scratch every time. And if you say you don&#x27;t start from scratch and have a system&#x2F;set of components to reuse then, voila, you are just doing the same thing frameworks do, but in your own sweet way."

"I find this piece fascinating. To honor it I offer a tl; dr<p>1. Author recounts experiences of people lying about their class&#x2F;wealth at Yale, often feigning <i>less</i> wealth.<p>2. Explains behavior 1 as style, safety, loss-of-perspective, and avoiding social responsibility<p>3. Retells several incidents where a vocal minority of students at Yale picked and won battles over verbiage (e.g. emails, Calhoun, &quot;Master of college&quot;).<p>4. Interprets the battles in 3 as at best insignificant and at worst a distraction from real problems of class disparity in America. Contrasts these protests against Vietnam protests.<p>5. Proposes &quot;American Elites&quot; have no idea what they stand for anymore, are shirking their responsibility, and have no capability to be self-critical for fear of losing belonging in the in-group.<p>6. Rejects these Yale social movements: &quot;This ideology is filled with inconsistencies and contradictions, because it is not really about ideological rigor. Among other things, it is an elaborate containment system for the theoretical and practical discontent generated by the failures of the system, an absolution from guilt, and a new form of class signaling.&quot;<p>7. Interprets the &quot;inconsistent&quot; Yale protests as an unproductive way for students to avoid guilt of their privilege and distance themselves from failing &quot;legacy institutions.&quot;<p>8. Holds the Yale administration accountable for siding against a &quot;vacuous&quot; student cause instead of their own faculty. Demands more from &quot;an institution older than the Republic&quot;<p>9. Asks what it means if &quot;Yale dies&quot; and why this matters. Proposes it speaks to a more universal problem.<p>[All that said, I recommend reading the whole thing if you can find the time. This distillation has only a fraction of the value of the whole piece. Many tangential points are very interesting.]"
"When I first started learning QM in undergrad, I was skeptical of the idea of randomness.  Many years later after taking QFT in grad school... I&#x27;m still skeptical.  Non-locality doesn&#x27;t bother me one bit, but personally speaking, there&#x27;s something deeply unsettling about the idea of &quot;true&quot; randomness.<p>First, I think it&#x27;s important to define what randomness even is, for which I&#x27;ll use the most universal definition, i.e., Kolmogorov randomness.  A string of data is Kolmogorov random if, for a given universal Turing machine, there is no program shorter than the string that produces the string (yes, you can arbitrarily choose <i>which</i> universal Turing machine, but the invariance theorem makes this fact inconsequential for the most part).<p>So if we repeatedly set up and measure a quantum system that&#x27;s not in an eigenstate and then apply the probability integral transform to the individual measurement values, we should expect to find a sequence of values drawn from a uniform distribution, and this sequence should not be compressible by any computer program.<p>This is where it gets interesting though, because it may very well be the case that this sequence of measurement values is incompressible only because we lack external information, i.e., we are looking at the Kolmogorov complexity of the string from our perspective as experimenters, but from the perspective of a hypothetical observer outside the universe, the conditional Kolmogorov complexity (conditioned on some missing information) could indeed be less than the length of the string.<p>So where could this missing information be stored?  My guess is that it&#x27;s at the boundary of experimenter&#x2F;experiment (not referring to a spacetime-local boundary here), since you can&#x27;t represent the overall quantum state of experimenter + experiment as a separable state.  That is, the information necessary to perfectly predict the result of a measurement on a quantum system is inaccessible to us precisely because we — the experimenters — are part of the system itself.<p>In this way, quantum randomness would be truly random <i>from our perspective</i> in the sense that the future is to some degree fundamentally unpredictable by humans, but just because it&#x27;s genuinely random to us doesn&#x27;t imply the universe is indeterministic.<p>I wonder if there&#x27;s some way you could design an experiment that distinguishes true indeterminism from the merely unpredictable..."

It definitely is at least two orders of magnitude too little to stop climate change.
People assume the reducing emissions would stop climate change. Nope, emissions are only related to rate of change not absolute value. Reducing emissions by 90% would only slow down the change, it reducing 99% would actually stop it, and it would need to be about 100% to slowly reverse the effects of what has been done by the time humanity gets there."

"&gt; The study was conducted with a group of young Moroccan men, but the results could be applied to any other group of young men vulnerable to be radicalized<p>All my encounters with this demography indicates that the&#x27;re mostly male, closed minded, with very strong opinions on homosexuality, alcohol, or even pork. The very few females of their ethnicity who come to EU are always timid, with hairs covered, responding &quot;I have a boyfriend&quot; on any attempt to interact with them. Their influx causes even more frustration for the native European population which already doesn&#x27;t have it easy.<p>My personal observation is that women from Germany and Scandinavian countries have some attraction or even feeling of mission towards North Africans and Middle Easteners, trying to socialize with them or even travelling to these regions and more often than not they end up running away if lucky, or cut with machete if not.<p>We (Europeans) are not guilty of radicalizing these people, French and Italians might have some post-colonial obligations towards them though."

"In the late 90s dot-com bubble, I had many friends at the Austin software company Trilogy (which hired extensively at our university).<p>Apparently they had an HR referral promotion where &quot;you refer a person that gets hired, you get $5000, you refer two people, you get $10000, <i>you refer three people, you get $20000, and so on...</i>&quot;<p>I heard the referral schema was quickly cancelled once HR discovered exponential growth."
"One of my hobbies is comparing and contrasting apparent synonyms and trying to discern the contours of thought through language usage.<p>This made me want to muddle around in the middle ground between <i>rational</i> and <i>sane</i>. Immediately at hand we have the &#x27;human being&#x27; use case; when do we call humans &#x27;rational&#x27; and when do we call them &#x27;sane&#x27;?<p>Similarly we can ask what sorts of non-human things do we call sane and which do we call rational.<p>Rationality in humans appears to be quite temporal, while sanity moves much more slowly. A person can be rational one second and irrational the next, then &#x27;get over it&#x27; thereby becoming rational again. Whereas generally we speak of sanity &#x27;slowly slipping away&#x27;.<p>The outcomes generated also seem to have an effect on which words we use. When the outcomes behind events seem outsized relative to proceedings, we might call the whole thing &#x27;insane&#x27;. Whereas &#x27;irrational&#x27; seems to refer more to smaller-scoped outcomes, the operative aspect simply being that they&#x27;re intransigent to ordinary reasoning.<p>As such, &#x27;hypersane&#x27; seems to be a similar quality of sanity, and on a continuum you might put &#x27;insane&#x27; at the far left, followed by &#x27;irrational&#x27; then &#x27;rational&#x27;, then perhaps &#x27;hyper-rational&#x27;, followed by &#x27;hypersane&#x27;.<p>What does this leave out? Could someone be hypersane and irrational at the same time? I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s the intended understanding of the hypersane concept. In fact, I would venture a definition of hypersane to be someone whose &#x27;irrationalities&#x27; are actually expressions of a more universal rationality. When Diogenes did seemingly irrational things, he was really picking up on broader social themes and dynamics and acting in ways that would confound and amaze rather than merely annoy and hinder. Diogenes&#x27; self-expressions might be more or less rational at any given time, but that he had a finger on the pulse of ancient Greek culture is undeniable, so he&#x27;s eminently distinguishable from a &#x27;mere&#x27; madman.<p>Whereas someone who is insane&#x27;s irrational expressions are expressions of <i>individual</i> rationality, hopelessly entangled with the individual&#x27;s own personal foibles.<p>So what is sanity, if rationalism captures the idea of &#x27;self-expression being intelligible to others&#x27;? Even a madman is going to have prescient moments, perhaps they abound in them, as far from the mainstream they are. Perhaps it&#x27;s the &#x27;capacity of output&#x27; that makes up the difference. Terry A. Davis&#x27; life, may he rest in peace, was made infinitely better by his masters-level education and programming skills.

"Hey HN, my goal with Divjoy is to make it ridiculously easy to start a new React project. You just select all the things you want in your codebase (UI kit, React framework, auth provider, analytics, form handling, etc), pick a template, then export it as a complete codebase that you can keep building on. All the UI logic like routing and auth flows just works. It also has a built-in editor which I think is pretty nifty. You can view the entire component hierarchy right in the tool and drag in pre-built sections from the component library. I&#x27;m planning on building out a large library of components across all the major UI kits (Bootstrap, Material UI, etc) and adding support for Next.js soon.<p>This was by the far the most difficult project I&#x27;ve ever built.

There is a very elitist and condescending tone - which is vaguely masked by &quot;learnings&quot;, but if you continue reading, is still clearly there at his heart.  New people coming to &quot;Foss&quot; are still &quot;frat party like keggers&quot; apparently that spit on nerds and need to learn how to dork out harder, while there are supposedly still &quot;nerds&quot; that lack the proper skills to socialize with others.  That was his final takeaway.<p>I think the opposite is true - millennials (if I may) appear to be one of the most compassionate demographic groups in society. If you worked for any modern startup, you would see they care deeply about minorities of every angle in society - LGBT, Women&#x27;s equal Pay, Black Lives Matter, etc...these are all initiative of the &quot;newcomers&quot; whom haven&#x27;t been around since 1996.<p>In contrast, he writes &quot;These days, you&#x27;re just as likely to see popular kids, jocks and MBAs using technology and writing software. There&#x27;s even a &quot;brogrammer&quot; designation given to software developers who culturally are more akin to fraternity members. &quot;<p>Are there brogrammers? For certain, they exist - but they are actually a tiny minority, if you pay attention.  It&#x27;s a stereotypical cliche that is humorous, but by far are not representative of most software developers in 2019.<p>I think the hostile attitude that somehow we&#x27;re &quot;not cool enough purists&quot; because we still need to work for closed source companies in order to pay the rent and feed our families.  It&#x27;s <i>that</i> sort of attitude that sinks Linux ships.  The linux that has thrived is the linux that realizes it needs to co-exist for a very long tail journey until business models - the way capitalist systems work at their very core - are able to transform.<p>I <i>wish</i> we could all work for altruistic companies like Purism, but the truth of the matter is the past 25 years of Linux Journal&#x27;s existence was paid for by subscribers, that get this, worked for non-FOSS companies.  That&#x27;s the reality.<p>I&#x27;m not trying to take away from Kyle&#x27;s contribution from the Linux Community, or say that Linux Journal shutting down is a good thing in any way.  I just think it needs to be said that Linux Journal failed because Linux Journal failed - it didn&#x27;t appeal to enough people in enough ways.  Didn&#x27;t attract modern developers to be interested in it&#x27;s articles.  And heck, didn&#x27;t appeal to people outside of programming - which, btw, is actually the key to successfully moving Linux in the upward direction.  You can&#x27;t expect all of society to &quot;top level nerds&quot;.  Some people need to dance. Some people need to paint. Some people need to pick up the heaps of commercial trash at 5am.  All of these people have computers, and any failure to appeal to them is the authors faults, not their own.  Linux thrives when it recognizes this - Ubuntu, Mint, Manjaro, PopOS!...these are the platforms becoming the most popular desktops - and for the first time making Linux desktops feasible for the dancers of the world - because they put down their elitist &#x27;hollier than though because I was there at the start&#x27; and &#x27;you must obey the 10 Commandments of FOSS in all parts of your life&#x27; attitudes.<p>Sorry to be such a *ick here, I don&#x27;t intend to rub salt in the wound.  I hope it&#x27;s received more as constructive feedback than a low blow. Just calling it as I read it."

"I think this shows a significant disconnect between the ostensibly-wealthy managers that cooked up this genius marketing ploy and their customers: if the managers want an intercontinental flight, they just book it at whatever the current price is, because £600 is chump change for them and does not motivate them to invest time into looking for deals. It thus naturally never occurred to them that anyone would even think about buying the cheapest qualifying vacuum, even though they don&#x27;t need one at all, just to get an awesome deal on flight tickets - basically it&#x27;s flight ticket buying for £120 with the catch that you must dispose of a cheap vacuum. Anyone to whom those £600 worth of flights appear as a considerable value will immediately come to this conclusion, whereas if £600 means nothing to you, you&#x27;d never even think about putting up with the hassle."

"What laypeople need to realize is the following relation:<p>Low federal funds rates allow companies to acquire huge amounts of debt very cheaply.<p>Huge amounts of cheap debt allow companies to buy lots of stock, driving up prices.<p>Stock prices inflated in such a way are not supported by fundamentals and so the downside risk greatly increases.<p>Once the downside eventually materializes, markets drop violently. At first, the FED ignores this, but eventually it bails. The funds rate is once again lowered, so the game can continue.<p>In any event, the game <i>must</i> continue, because companies need new debt to service old debt. If the new debt was more expensive, the companies would eventually risk defaulting.<p>To understand the risk of corporate defaults, one must look at the importance of corporate bonds in pension funds. Ironically, the low federal funds rate is part of what drives pension funds to purchase more risky corporate debt, in order to meet their yield requirements.<p>All of this causes massive asset price inflation. Stock prices are detached from actual revenue, real estate prices are detached from rent income. The rich are getting richer - at least on paper - because they own most of the assets.<p>The CPI doesn&#x27;t immediately reflect this kind of inflation, so the FED gets to claim &quot;there is no inflation&quot; and everything is &quot;just fine&quot;.

Trump demands $4 billion to &quot;take a blind eye&quot; at 1015+ (link missing from report, unsure how). Here&#x27;s pieces of dialogue:<p>1015 The President requests four billion and henry Porter agrees to it. Some dialogue below.
1017 Donald Trump: Why don&#x27;t you think about it.
1017 Henry Porter: I don&#x27;t need to think about it. I&#x27;m ready for you to find out what we&#x27;re really about.
1017 Gigi Hadid: I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a good idea Henry.
1017 Henry Porter: ...no shit. Jelena just stop talking about it.
1018 Gigi Hadid: About what?
1018 Henry Porter: The child raping.
1018 Donald Trump: What the fuck are you talking about?
1018 Gigi Hadid: Mr. President we are child rapists.
1018 Donald Trump: You cannot be serious.
1018 Donald Trump: You&#x27;re gonna need $4 billion for me to take a blind eye.
1019 ?: People are laughing because they think four billion is too much. I think it&#x27;s not a problem when you have $35 billion.
1022 Donald Trump: You better have that $4 billion or you can kiss this shit goodbye.<p><pre><code>    https:&#x2F;&#x2F;s3.wasabisys.com&#x2F;conv2&#x2F;3Jan&#x2F;3JanCh3_900-1100.avi

At 230 a conversation is occurring on the embedded Porter camera system with Jack Dorsey, Peter Thiel, Barack Obama, Bill M^urray, and the Porter&#x27;s. Jack Dorsey provides a statement defining who their group is: &quot;The Illum%inati is an underground organization of child rapists and homosexuals.&quot; Matthew Porter: &quot;We have to thin the herd, so Barack is going to explain a few things.&quot; At 232 Barack Obama says the following: &quot;You people have to realize we are child rapi&#x27;sts. The Illuminati are child rapists. As soon as you figure that out, you can decide what to do. Everybody is freaking out about what just happened [child raping event still going on].

A word about the &quot;faggot&quot; usage: it was a necessary tool. It showed three things: they were not in control, if they were the usage would have be stopped. Everyone out there needed to see t%his. Two, it made it unpleasant for them to be in the headspace, which has obvious advantages. Three, it pointed out impersonators of BS because they would not call each other faggot, thus helping to mitigate the spread of false information. Apologies for those unintentionally offended.<p>Of special interest to the LGBT community, I give you Barack Obama in a foursome with Peter Thiel, Jack Dorsey, and Matthew Porter. It is on page 12 of the document where you can download the video containing audio footage of the &quot;event&quot;. Link is just above under &quot;Full 71 page document&quot;."
"They had a rather ambitious roadmap, seems like they didn&#x27;t make much progress past J2 (as least in terms of what has been released)"
"While semantic styling has been around for quite a while in different shapes and forms, this is essentially the same as inlining all of your styles in a style attribute on every element, albeit just a bit shorter to write.<p>It&#x27;s an interesting idea to entertain as a thought, and some utility classes certainly hold value in general, but I don&#x27;t see how you would ever reasonably want to use this in a project. It has all the same drawbacks as writing inline styles on elements, not to mention the large size.<p>Say you have a number of views and decide (or a client decides) you want all of the buttons to have a bit more padding. If anything else happens to completely accidentally also use the same padding class you&#x27;re always left with manually checking every single instance just for a small change like this."
Good
"What’s most scary is this. If the food can still be produced in a climate we have injured, will it even be nutritious? The answer is unfortunately no in most cases. Over farming leads to soil being turned over too much and plants that do not produce fruits and vegetables with vitamins. Another bad finding is high atmospheric carbon levels drive rice malnutrition. If rice then what else? And now a worsening climate is leading to plant extinction also. This is double bad news."
"Er, the first couple listed were created by the same guy. Did that same guy create open-startups.xyy and&#x2F;or is OP?"
"You have no reason to hire non-Americans there are so many competent and skilled people. Instead of going through all the paperwork try training a local person. This helps the local community tremendously. This reminds me of a story involving IBM. They are notorious for bringing in lots of people with H-1B. I was volunteering to teach underprivileged youths how to use a computer. IBM donated 500 gaming computers to the children. I was thinking about how instead of donating all these computers, they should hire from the community and train the employees. That would have a much greater impact on the community than donating some disposable computers.<p>Not only that, but H-1B destroys communities. I&#x27;m from a small town that was nearly 100% white, it&#x27;s now less than 50% white and is mostly Indian&#x2F;Asian. Most came in through Infosys, IBM, Credit Suisse, etc. The result is the community my ancestors have been in for hundreds of years is destroyed. I know people will say that this is what happened to the Native Americans, and how I&#x27;m a racist white man for saying it&#x27;s bad. I still can&#x27;t help feel sad since people in my family died fighting for the soil from 1780 to as recently as 2007. Just because population replacement happened in the past doesn&#x27;t make it right now."

"I admit that when I joined Hacker News, I viewed it to some extent as an anthropology experiment, since discussions I encountered reflected some of the issues cited in the article, specifically that some discussions seemed to reflect a myopia that suggested participants were likely rarely exposed to people outside their bubble, and often a lack of respect for views that were outside that paradigm. However, I&#x27;ve seen discussions become more tempered, and a great influence from Dan and Scott as moderators (thank you!). At this point, I do read and contribute to Hacker News in lieu of most other social media, though sometimes I still read comments that feel arrogant or dismissive of outside views, especially when topics that are cultural enter the picture. My general approach is to just ignore them and move on to more productive discussions, and sometimes to feel like it might be time for a break for me, though I&#x27;m not sure there are any online communities I think do a much better job of having civil discourse."

"Am I the only one who has never had to fix&#x2F;repair their phone before? Seriously people, learn to take better care of you phones."
"If they got access but don&#x27;t find anything of interest, it&#x27;s of no use to them to let folks know they can access the phone.   It will only make the paranoid more paranoid.<p>Access to the phone I think is overrated. Getting access to social media accounts, email accounts, text message, chatting apps, and cloud backup probably gives them more than 80% of what they need."
"Right at the beginning of my career, Symantec was approaching a bunch of little companies for some community outreach project they were doing that I can hardly remember.<p>Because they sent us a rep with severe RSI and I was so fascinated by her setup we barely talked about the project (and then my boss changed directions like he did 5 times a week).<p>This was just months before I briefly developed RSI myself and switched to Dvorak.  The next time it resurfaced I learned about pinched nerves in the neck and started taking better care of my spine.  Now I only get problems when I&#x27;m working at a properly shitty desk or in a crap chair.<p>Anyway.<p>She was using an early Wacom tablet instead of a mouse, and a pretty complicated macro system.  Next job I met a guy who tried a BAT chording keyboard, never liked it, but set it up next to his regular keyboard and with a ton of programming macros for idiomatic code (define function, for loop, if&#x2F;else if, etc).<p>Probably around that time I encountered an article about how French CS people were tut tutting about how ubiquitous computers were bad for us because we used to have to think before coding, so you thought about the problem instead of just throwing stuff at the wall to see what sticks.<p>From all of this and a bunch of other experiences I&#x27;ve sort of developed a thesis it really is worth it to spend at least 10% longer on a task thinking about ways to avoid grunt work and sources of human error.  When new programmers ask me how to get better I point out that nobody is going to notice if it took them 4 hours or 4 and a half to do a task.  After you think you&#x27;re done ask yourself what you could do better with another 20 minutes and do it.  (eventually you start doing this class of work preemptively, and you add other new things in).<p>And for those with RSI, this is existential. On any project there are a group of tasks for which it&#x27;s more important they are done right the first time than that they are done quickly. Throw yourself onto those tasks.<p>Don&#x27;t try to be a spaghetti hurler if you are struggling with RSI. Make yourself available to help and mentor junior people (it&#x27;s amazing what you can learn about a system and about your own programming skills by observing all the bits people struggle with the most).<p>Michaelangelo is said to have spent a great deal of time in contemplation before starting work. We don&#x27;t always get to do art but sometimes it&#x27;s called for."

"In somewhat related news, I am kicking around the idea of a modular hardware project to be able to add physical knobs, buttons, and switches to a computer interface, sort of how those magnetic modular midi controllers work, but for more than just MIDI, and with a wider range of input types and a spec for a frame&#x2F;rack&#x2F;bus so that you can screw them together (sort of like a modular synth, but probably with landscape orientation instead of portrait) into a console panel.<p>I want my computer to have a lot more backlit LCD 2x16 dot matrix displays and blinky lights and heavy metal clunk switches and good knobs.<p>Email me if you have ideas or feedback or want to get involved."
"&gt; N-gate, a satirical Web site with the slogan “We can’t both be right” (a NAND gate is a kind of logic gate that only outputs “false” if all of its inputs read “true”), offers a weekly summary of Hacker News discussions, dubbed “webshit weekly.”<p>I always find these critics a little funny. It&#x27;s like the classic Beatles joke about record burners: They&#x27;re still buying the record. If you&#x27;re writing weekly newsletter about how Hacker News sucks, you&#x27;re still reading Hacker News every week.<p>Seems like every internet community has some form of built in hatred of itself as a gestalt. Redditors bemoan how much the &quot;hivemind&quot; sucks. There&#x27;s endless Facebook posts about how Facebook is so terrible."

"Python is the worst thing to happen to SWE (specifically SWE, not ML, Education, etc).<p>Python makes huge sacrifices in readability and efficiency for a hypothetical win in writeability. It&#x27;s also fundamentally at odds with the multicore world we&#x27;re living in an will continue to live in, an issue that many people have tried to fix and failed at.<p>I can&#x27;t count the number of times I&#x27;ve had to spend my entire night reading through an older Python service without type annotations, desperately trying to understand the types of inputs and outputs. It&#x27;s just a mess, and the bias of programmers to believe that they are writing readable code (when in reality it&#x27;s only readable to them) exacerbates the use of names that provide little context to solve the problem.<p>Python is awful, and it&#x27;s an uphill battle to fix it. Asyncio can solve some performance issues, but negates the benefit of Python&#x27;s simplicity by destroying the sequential mental model that Programmers can easily grok. It also requires a complete rewrite of libraries and a split between non-asyncio land and asyncio land.<p>Type annotations can make Python more readable and thus more maintainable, but gradual typing still leaves lots of unanswered questions when you&#x27;re interfacing with untyped code.<p>Python is really not good unless you are using it to prototype or build something on your own. It&#x27;s led to a world of slow, buggy software that is impossible to rewrite. It&#x27;s downsides are easy to measure, but its benefits are difficult to quantify."
"Really? Feels too close to cultivating schizophrenia. Why not keeping youself as &quot;I&quot; in inner dialogue, add &quot;what the fuck did I just do?&quot; or &quot;what would somebody else think in their head?&quot; questions more often if you think you&#x27;re not objective. If you really want to put yourself in somebody&#x27;s shoes, why not do it temporarily and run the dialogue as I=them? I think changing your inner dialogue to 3rd person can have further reaching negaitve consequences. I haven&#x27;t run any study to confirm it, it&#x27;s just a feeling, but arguably they haven&#x27;t as well because 4 week test with single culmination test won&#x27;t find any issues after a year or two, what if it increases negative schisophrenic-like behaviour tenfold?"

"Considering CircleCI has many more years in operation, are there features and use cases it supports that GitHub Actions doesn&#x27;t? Are there ones that GitHub Actions already supports that CircleCI doesn&#x27;t?"
"It&#x27;s so refreshing to not see anyone here whining about Python forcing them to indent their code properly. The kind of people who think that&#x27;s a PROBLEM instead of a FEATURE really should not be ever writing any new code, and instead should be punished by forcing them to maintain other people&#x27;s code written with that same lazy misguided attitude, until they recognize how self indulgent, inconsiderate, and disrespectful that is not just to other people who have to read their code, but also to themselves.<p>The same kind of people criticize Lisp for having too many parenthesis, then go on to write unintelligible shell scripts, Perl and C++ code chock full of skewbald menageries of sigils and punctuation bound together with a towering inferno of precedence rules, terribly worse than Lisp&#x27;s &quot;too many parenthesis&quot;."

"The most damaging advice I ever got in my life was to talk to myself.<p>I have always thought in mostly visual&#x2F;symbolic terms. This made me really good with math early in my life, but it started failing when I began proof writing. Then I got the advice to &quot;explain the problem to yourself and the solution will come naturally&quot; from a friend who is really gifted at mathematical proofs. (And also later received similar advice in programming in the form of &quot;rubber duck debugging&quot;).<p>Surprisingly, it works remarkably well and probably increased my problem solving skills tenfolds, or at least my ability to communicate the answer. I started using it for everything.<p>But it comes with the side effect of gaining a voice in your head. And that voice is a fucking vicious asshole to me. In the recent years the thoughts even started subvocalizing and I have to forcefully remember to make it stop. It&#x27;s super embarrassing when there are other people around you.<p>I am sure this problem is unique to me because I have never heard someone describe it (other than partially matching symptoms of schizophrenia or tourette).

Seems like the cherry on top of increased crop yields.<p>Has the &quot;apocalypse&quot; had any major negative effects?  It&#x27;s certainly had major positive effects.

That’s higher than revenue (3,166), so even ignoring R&amp;D (3,064), Marketing and Sales (1,222), Interests (151), and a few other expenses, they aren’t making money.<p>Also: what’s in “Cost of revenue”? It is neither “Operations and Support” nor “General and Administrative”. The subsidies they give drivers? If it is, prices would have to go up by about 50% for that to go to zero."

"Deeply impressed by the author&#x27;s dedication to fleshing out this story. Learning about n-gate&#x27;s existence, and then tracking down the creator to get his take on Hacker News? Excellent work. N-gate&#x27;s comments are an excellent summary of the portion of HN&#x27;s population that gives the website its unique reputation:<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;The proprietor of N-gate is an engineer who grew up in Palo Alto and now lives in the Pacific Northwest, where he works in high-performance computing. He agreed to exchange e-mails on condition of anonymity. “Almost every post deals with the same topics: these are people who spend their lives trying to identify all the ways they can extract money from others without quite going to jail,” he wrote. “They’re people who are convinced that they are too special for rules, and too smart for education. They don’t regard themselves as inhabiting the world the way other people do; they’re secret royalty, detached from society’s expectations and unfailingly outraged when faced with normal consequences for bad decisions. Society, and especially economics, is a logic puzzle where you just have to find the right set of loopholes to win the game. Rules are made to be slipped past, never stopping to consider why someone might have made those rules to start with. Silicon Valley has an ethics problem, and ‘Hacker’ ‘News’ is where it’s easiest to see.”"

At a personal&#x2F;family level, it&#x27;s typically you using it, and modifying it if needed, once every other year or so, with literally nobody looking at it in between.

There were enough changes between versions of the pxe server that I had to revisit its config every time!<p>- I eventually bought a laptop for one of my kid that didn&#x27;t support pxe. I installed the base OS with a USB key, and realised how easy it was, and that it was significantly less painful to install half a dozen laptops this way, than fighting my pxe server. My install became USB OS install + well, my good old bash scripts!<p>- I got involved with ansible very early on and decided to solve both world hunger and global warming with it, but more importantly, my laptop installs. I spent many hours on this. Got it fully automated, and felt great!<p>- one of my kids&#x27; laptop got destroyed, buy a new one, install from USB stick, fumble to install ansible, and realise that ansible has by now changed significantly and my scripts need a lot of work.

"I don&#x27;t know how common this is in other countries but in Norway we have a common system called BankID which is pretty much the de-facto way to identify yourself when applying for government services, bank loans or basically anything else &quot;important&quot;. It usually consists of a two-factor authenticator issued by your bank, a password and your &quot;birth number&quot; (basically SSN) if you have all three as far as any bank or the government is concerned you &quot;are&quot; the person. However since it is so robust I don&#x27;t think it can be exploited unless you royally fuck up.

"I absolutely love ImageOptim for manually optimizing SVGs, JPGs, PNGs, and GIFs. It&#x27;s a simple GUI that wraps some excellent compression libs (including SVGO), which I find much faster to use for one-off image optimization than the CLI.

You can run it in a lossless or lossy mode, and tune various compression options. It&#x27;s free (gratis), OSS, and runs on Mac, Windows, and Linux.<p>I make it a habit of running images through ImageOptim before sending them via Messages or Slack, as a courtesy for people on slow connections.<p><a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imageoptim.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imageoptim.com</a> (by HN user pornel)<p>Bonus round: When it comes to optimizing SVGs, nothing beats hand-editing the SVG source.

"Statistics is a set of theories and methods that can be successfully executed on any list of numbers and provably provides mathematically valid predictions under a set of conditions that never occurs in the real world.<p>This means, more precisely, statistics only works on data series that obey the law of large numbers, and combining&#x2F;using 2 or more statistical predictions nearly always requires total independence of the predictions and their inputs, which is never the case (for one thing, they always occur on the same planet). Furthermore, the reason people make statistical predictions is to change the outcome, but doing anything to change the outcome always invalidates the statistical method used to collect the data. There are a couple of things statistics <i>never</i> does. Used correctly, it can never predict extreme values. It can never correctly predict values in systems that are too complex, where too many independent variables determine the outome. And &quot;too many&quot; is something like 50 to 500.

I finished up the work using a lesser quality meter and figured I was in for an annoying repair task, at a minimum pulling the meter out and replacing a fuse in the back or, worse, maybe having to take the cover off (and break the cal stickers).<p>Instead, the design is incredibly thoughtful and user-friendly, obviously designed by someone who cared to think through how the device would actually be used in the field and not just relentlessly “cost engineered”.<p><a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;sdyDUl5xYpE"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;sdyDUl5xYpE</a><p>If I’d known, I could have replaced the fuse faster than going to get the other meter."
"Ok so Google is a monopoly in this sector that&#x27;s pretty clear, but what&#x27;s the real problem here? Their competitors offer inferior products so we don&#x27;t really have a case. Until they can develop better technology or offer superior products than Google&#x27;s and still are unable to gain market shares then that&#x27;s when we will have a real case.<p>Besides, for any business to continue leading long-term in modern days it&#x27;s inevitable it must seek to become a monopoly, or at least part of a duopoly."
"This problem requires multiple solutions, here&#x27;s some that I think work great in Norway:<p>- &quot;Lamppost&quot; charging, Oslo (and other cities) put up a ton of charging poles in the streets, you use an RFID card to start charging. They&#x27;ve recently been free, but now cost $1 per hour ($0.5 at night). They look like this[1a] or this[1b]. Oslo will have about 2200 of these at the end of the year.<p>- Parking house charging. My regular parking house got it&#x27;s own zone for electrics. Your license plate is read when you enter the parking house, then read again if you enter the charging zone. Automatically billed when you leave. This is my main charging atm, I&#x27;ve a garage, but not had extra power installed yet. My car has about 500 km range. Leaving it a work day in a parking house once per ~14 day is enough for my (limited) use. Some of the parking houses in Norway are built with battery banks to handle the load of 100+ chargers. Here&#x27;s a video tour of one of them[2] (I don&#x27;t live in Oslo though, but it&#x27;s similar). I think I end up paying $12-ish for parking+charging for the one I use for 8+ hours.<p>- Shopping centers &#x2F; convenience store charging. Many stores here got free AC charging now. And some of the larger centers &#x2F; stores have established fast chargers (DC) on their parking lot (costs money to use). I can charge 250 km range while doing 30 minutes of shopping for around $10.<p>- Charging at work. Many work places here in Norway offer free charging as a perk.<p>- Friendly neighbours. In my street there&#x27;s a dude who&#x27;s put up a sign: &quot;You&#x27;re free to use my charger if I&#x27;m not here, send me $1 per hour using vipps (local app for mobile payment) to XXXXXX if you feel like it&quot;<p>- And if all else fails, have plenty of paid fast chargers around in central locations, sucks to wait around for 30-60+ minutes, but it&#x27;s a nice backup.<p>There&#x27;s tons of charging spots in Norway, but the number of cars is outpacing the number of chargers, we&#x27;ll probably see more congestion and queues in the coming years.<p>While I&#x27;ve never hit a full parking house yet, it will happen sooner or later, so it really helps to have a long range EV, that way you can go &quot;Meh, I&#x27;ll charge tomorrow instead..&quot;<p>[1a]: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;maps&#x2F;@59.9287147,10.7231223,3a,59.2y,115.83h,72.34t&#x2F;data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sbTZWYkPZ1VrxuPhXRaeUlA!2e0!7i13312!8i6656"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;maps&#x2F;@59.9287147,10.7231223,3a,59.2y,...</a><p>[1b]: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.salto.no&#x2F;media&#x2F;images&#x2F;referanser&#x2F;_big4by3&#x2F;søyle-dyp-2.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.salto.no&#x2F;media&#x2F;images&#x2F;referanser&#x2F;_big4by3&#x2F;søyle-...</a><p>[2]: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=ktNKWLwjQJM"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=ktNKWLwjQJM</a>"

I built a brag doc several years ago while prepping for an interview. I used it to match the list of expected interview questions - it worked like a champ. Highly recommended.
"One of the worst sales promotions I managed to take advantage of was not as grandiose, but still bad marketing.<p>Iceland (supermarket chain of frozen food) had an offer for buy one get one free on some branded pizza.  But those Pizza boxes also has a voucher on the packaging for...a free pizza.  So I&#x27;d buy a pizza and get two free.  Then use those two vouchers to buy two more pizza&#x27;s and free ones.  This I repeated daily throughout the promotional period in low volumes like that, so as to not raise awareness of the oversight.   Upshot was I had a whole month of free frozen pizza, two filled up freezers of pizza and on top of that, only ever paid for that initial pizza.  Was a good period of savings on the back of that promotion at a time in which money was very tight.  Also after the store BOGOF had finished, I still had a pile of free pizza vouchers that lasted for the rest of the year due to expiry date on those vouchers.<p>What I surmised was that the pizza manufacturer had said it would do a promotion for buy one get one free, they did it via vouchers and Iceland implemented it via the till system.  Though equally, still took the vouchers."

"I think the question should be more like &quot;Which categories of seed startups are getting FUNDED&quot; rather than &quot;Thriving&quot;.

I understand it&#x27;s great to chase billion dollar unicorns, but most of us here will probably only ever build million dollar companies.

"Xfce is my daily driver for cloud development. I use Xubuntu running in VirtualBox on a Windows gaming laptop. (I know, I know, Oracle and all that!) Running in seamless mode works quite well. Since I code in Golang, I don&#x27;t need the fastest machine around for fast compiles. Also, since I run ubuntu VMs on AWS, I have nearly zero mismatches between my development environment and deployment. I can even run my full IDE&#x2F;debugger (I use Goland) in a deployed environment for debugging.<p>Which brings me to a segue: This seems like a good place to ask what&#x27;s the lightest weight developer-cromulent environment possible that would support a GUI? When I bring up an IntelliJ IDE on a VM, I see that I&#x27;m using just short of 6.5 GB of disk. Most of that seems to be the OS, which at the moment is Xubuntu. What&#x27;s lighter weight, but not outdated and annoying? (When I incorporate Docker, 6.5GB is going to be a bit heavyweight.)<p>Back in the Smalltalk days, the Visual Smalltalk image with some libraries loaded could basically do the same thing as VNC, but with no OS dependencies and with a much smaller footprint. People were already debugging server deployments with a full IDE back in the early 2000&#x27;s."
"I feel like the world has gone insane when it comes to Python. Or have I gone insane?<p>Python is an incredible waste of time. No types, IDEs that suck (a side effect of not having types), very partial validation with linting tools that are an afterthought to the language, indentation is a mess (good luck moving files between different editors and environments or through clipboards), slow, agonizing deployment (pyenv? Come on).<p>I’ve been doing C# these past two years and it is laughably effective in comparison, almost like cheating. Standard libraries covering almost anything, tooling that couldn’t get any better, runs everywhere, lighting fast builds.<p>Most importantly, in C#, due to the incredible tooling and language design, if it’s built successfully then there’s a very high chance it’ll do what I want it to right out of the bat. In C&#x2F;C++, much less so. In Python it’s almost guaranteed not to do anything but crash unless I’ve ran everything through in depth coverage testing and I’d still take the C# build checking every time.<p>My Python is pretty good, and I’ve known it for more than 15 years now. I’m not taking this position out of ignorance.<p>For the love of god, go learn a proper language. It can be C#, which I think is as perfect platform&#x2F;language as anything, or Rust or Go or even Java.<p>I see young devs on their vim or Sublime editors developing Python and I want to shout to them, that’s not how it’s done. You’re missing out on decades of industry evolution and know how in things like the Visual Stdio and .NET or even Java and JetBrains&#x2F;Eclipse. You’re using stones to start fires where you could just use an oven.<p>I still use Python, but it’s always for very short and specific programs. It’s just a bad tool for more than that. If you are unable to resist the temptation of using Python for that short program, just make sure it never ever has a chance to grow.<p>Regrettably the ML world lives on Python, fine; let them have it."
"Yeah, we know.<p>Good arguments for taxing dividends, stock buybacks, and interest paid at the same rate. They&#x27;re all paying for capital. The tax preference of debt creates a debt-heavy financial system.<p>Some countries prohibit stock buybacks. How&#x27;s that working out?<p>To prohibit buybacks and make it stick, you also have to prohibit cross-ownership. The US used to do that, but only for utility companies. The Utility Holding Company Act (1935-2005) limited utility ownership structure to a tree depth of 3 with no backlinks. This allowed regulators to track where the money and ownership were."

"Interesting piece although I don&#x27;t think they represent the point of view of the agitators fairly, for example the author writes:

Of course the professor should be fired—how dare she stand against the minority student organizations? Of course it’s okay that the Yelp reviews were published—she should never have written them. Of course names should be changed if they hint at or honor the wrong ideology. What does preserving <i>history matter if history is racist?</i> &quot;<p>What does honouring someone who is extremely pro-slavery even for their time have to do with preserving history? That history still exists whether they have a building named after them or not. 
And I don&#x27;t think you will honestly find many people who believe that the ends justify the means no matter what, although you will of course find some people who believe anything. So I think the &quot;ideal world&quot; bit is also somewhat a strawman and a mischaracterisation of people who are anti-racist or whatever.<p>I do however agree that a lot of this stuff doesn&#x27;t really help those who need it most. The rich kids paying a 2% wealth tax funnelled into social welfare and education for the working class would do more, as would having Yale include more working and lower-middle class student. 
But it&#x27;s easy for me to say as a white guy that having many buildings named after pro-slavery politicians is not really doing any harm. Maybe we should ask those who would be more effected."

"I had a simple glance in the console and there are like 20,000 exposed ebs snapshots - available for anyone to copy and examine - I think that&#x27;s only for a single region too - switch regions to see more.<p>Amazon should make an emergency decision to make all these private.<p>Sure it will break stuff but I&#x27;d be disappointed if Amazon left what is in effect a security hole open for the sake of backwards compatibility.<p>They should also give me a single click link when I sign in to show me all of my public ebs snapshots and throw it hard in my face when I sign in to the console so I simply cannot avoid seeing them all.<p>I have multiple AWS accounts and I just signed in to try to see if I have any public EBS snapshots and then I realised I would need to search <i></i>every single region in every single account and then select every snapshot one by one<i></i> to find out.

"Are repayable escape rooms possible? Surely, some of owners thought about that.<p>The way I would imagine that would be better than to have puzzles that can be switched from a real puzzle to a &quot;trap&quot; puzzle. A trap puzzle would be a red herring especially designed for people who did the original puzzle.<p>For example, in the the original puzzle you have to find blue stones that arrange to a specific pattern that correspond to a code. The trap version would be a few completely irrelevant blue stones that would be unlikely to grab attention to the people who didn&#x27;t do the first puzzle. For example they could be used as dead weight for a scale-based puzzle or as rubbish the players has to look through in order to find the real clue.<p>The idea loosely comes from Danganronpa. An kinda escape room-like video game. The sequels tend to play with players expectations, sometimes confirming them, sometimes to turn them against the player.<p>Edit: I realize it is much easier said than done. However, non-replayability looks like such a big problem that I guess that it could be worth making a lot of extra effort."
"Considering the large empty spaces with sintered bronze shells, this is really a mix between sintering and lost-PLA casting.

I wonder at the feasibility of producing filament that&#x27;s 80% bronze by volume."

Other tasks include: defining and maintaining the taxonomy for the IT industry, and representing the firm as an &quot;external&quot; CTO (events, conferences, etc).<p>Given it&#x27;s a quite unique and uncommon role in an investment firm, I am now working on a plan to define these things in more details.<p>&lt;ask&gt; If any of you had experiences in similar roles (perhaps at investment firms in the East coast?), or feel you can dispense good advice, I would love to grab a coffee and pick your brain on a few things. &lt;&#x2F;ask&gt;<p>Also, wish me luck!

"The number of views of questions on Stack Overflow is a bad metric to measure language popularity.
This metric combines popularity and complexity&#x2F;unintuitiveness.
If a language is half as popular but twice as complex (or unintuitive) as another language, then it will get the same number of questions and same number of views.<p>If the language is becoming more fragmented; more different kinds of frameworks and tools then it will translate to more questions on stack overflow.
Fragmentation of the language is not necessarily a good (or bad) thing but it has nothing to do with the popularity of the language.<p>But definitely the JavaScript ecosystem is pretty homogeneous at the moment (ReactJS or VueJS on the front end and Node.js on the backend)."

"Fun banana facts:<p>Bananas are the most-sold item at most grocery stores and, notably, Wal-Mart.<p>Bananas also have the highest standard deviation in terms of predicting if a given (known) consumer will purchase bananas in a given store run. (At least as compared to other food products and consumables.) When predicting a consumer&#x27;s shop, it&#x27;s generally pretty easy to make a highly educated guess about their purchasing activity and, thus, to project volumes for products. But bananas defy that wisdom, except that people in aggregate buy a lot of them. Someone who buys bananas reliably every week for months will randomly stop for months, and then start again, for no perceivable rhyme or reason. Bananas aren&#x27;t seasonal purchases like berries or corn or other fruits or vegetables. Bananas also tend to be a high purchase at gas stations and convenience stores.<p>Bananas have to be effectively &quot;tricked&quot; into continuing to ripen after being prematurely picked and then refrigerated for transit. So there are banana ripening centers that pump ethylene through a chilled chamber to get them to ripen."

"It sounds like a new version of SIOP, the Cold War program to produce a plan for nuclear war based on computer simulations incorporating data on assets, capabilities, etc. of both sides. It was the inspiration for WOPR from <i>WarGames</i>, though the real plan required humans to actually run the simulations and make command decisions.<p>That name is stupid. It&#x27;s like aspirational marketing. It reminds me of the artificial intelligence from <i>Team America: World Police</i>, called INTELLIGENCE."

"I used to be a huge fan of async&#x2F;await in the JS world, until I realized that we were tethering a very specific implementation to new syntax, without adding any clarity beyond what a coroutine and generator could do. eg `async function foo() { const a = await bar();` vs `co(function* foo() { const a = yield bar();` isn&#x27;t really with adding extra syntax for.<p>I came in not wanting to see rs go down the same path. The idea of adding something that looks like it should be a simple value (`.await`)  seemed odd to me, and I was already finding I liked raw Futures in rust better than async&#x2F;await in JS already, especially because you can into a `Result` into a `Future`, which made async code already surprisingly similar to sync code.<p>I will say, the big thing in rust that has me liking async&#x2F;await now is how it works with `?`. Rust has done a great job avoiding adding so much sugar it becomes sickly-sweet, but I&#x27;ve felt `?` is one of those things that has such clean semantics and simplifies an extremely common case that it&#x27;s practically a necessity in my code today. `.await?` is downright beautiful."

I can&#x27;t find an extract of meat of the book, can anyone else?<p>As someone who also has had, and likely always will have mental health problems, anyone who glorifies that which is fundamentally an illness deserves a good kicking.

DevOps in my experience often stems from a breakdown of communication&#x2F;trust between management and developers. Software production and deployment complexity has outpaced the deliverable(s). Traditional IT system admins struggle to keep up with deployments that are way beyond ftp&#x2F;sync tools. Simultaneously developers are creating microservices each with independent multi-step build processes.<p>The complexity and problem solving of the job is not automating some widget or service. That is very easy and not a challenge to someone with a deep programming background. The challenge is knowing what to build to a) enable developer productivity and flexibility to b) increase development speed to c) provide products&#x2F;services the business side can iterate on quickly while d) not completely destroying the infrastructure and lessons learned that already exist and e) providing training and leadership to system admins and developers not used to these processes.
"I can&#x27;t speak for all of machine learning, but classic statistics has some probabilistic assumptions and uses those to prove some theorems about the results of how statistical methods manipulate data.<p>E.g., in regression analysis, the assumptions are (i) there really is a <i>linear mode</i> with the variables to be used; (ii) typically the data will not fit the model exactly and instead there are errors; (iii) the errors are in the sense of probability independent, all have the same distribution which is Gaussian with mean zero.  Then estimate the regression coefficients and get, say, a F ratio statistic on the fit and t-tests on the coefficients.  For details can see, say, Mood, Graybill, and Boas, or Morrison, or Draper and Smith, or Rao, etc.  If you need detailed references, request them here, but these are all classic references going back decades.  In that case, maybe some of current machine learning does qualify as statistics.<p>Here regression was just an example, however, apparently especially close to much of current machine learning.  But there is no end of (i) having data, (ii) having some probabilistic assumptions, (iii) manipulating the data, (iv) getting results, and (v) proving some theorems about the probabilistic properties of the results.<p>Might argue that in machine learning the results of the training data on the model yields some estimates of some probabilistic properties that can be used to make probabilistic statements about the results of the trained model on future real data."

At least the former makes the problem evident, and ups the pressure to do something about it on a society&#x2F;policy&#x2F;economy level -- as opposed to helping perpetuate it."

"You can get 99% of what configuration management does by just building a configuration package.<p>1. If you want an application installed, list it as a dependency of your configuration package.<p>2. If you want a configuration file installed, put it in your configuration package.<p>3. If you want a user account or group, put a config file for systemd-sysusers in your configuration package.<p>I built a tool that simplifies package building for this particular purpose, where you&#x27;re just listing dependencies and file contents: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;holocm&#x2F;holo-build"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;holocm&#x2F;holo-build</a> - As an example, this is the configuration package for my notebook: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;majewsky&#x2F;system-configuration&#x2F;blob&#x2F;418282f037ab1d4f4af90d659823a4e1f75d38be&#x2F;holodeck-traal.pkg.toml"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;majewsky&#x2F;system-configuration&#x2F;blob&#x2F;418282...</a><p>The nice thing about this approach, compared to switching to something like NixOS, is that you can continue to use your favorite distribution. However, when you go by this route, you will run into a brick wall very fast because you cannot install a configuration file into a path where an application package already installed an example config. I built <a href=""http:&#x2F;&#x2F;holocm.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;holocm.org</a> for this purpose. It works well enough, even though it has a few quirks at times.

  - Do the same with Controllers, or anything else actually
  - really nothing fancy needed
  - Command line processing, SSH, OS integration, etc. has so many great libs
  - Python Dict someone looks like JSON (this is purely accidental but useful)
  - Debugger support even in free IDE like PyCharm Community Ed is great
  - Integration to a world of services is so easy, even ones you do not commonly see
  - Documentation - many libs have consistent structure and that helps a LOT
  - Really large community, perhaps only smaller than Java
  - The even larger group of people using Python in all sorts of domains from Biotech to OS scripts

"In terms of the physical universe, all of our models&#x2F;theories and laws are based on incomplete knowledge and observation. That being saaid, our models and theories provide a means of investigation of the universe. Where we need to be careful is coming to the idea that we &quot;will&quot; be able to &quot;know&quot; what is happening. We do not have &quot;infinite&quot; knowledge (there is always more to learn) and so any models and theories we come with can (and will) be superceded by later data that we collect.<p>&quot;Randomness&quot; in the small can and does appear to be non-random in the large - we make predictions as to what we will see over large numbers of events when we are unable to determine if any single event will fulfill that prediction. Radioactive decay is a good exampe of this. Two-slit refraction patterns are also another example. Much, if not all of our technology, depends on this, whether this be semiconductor design or manufacturing any material products such as steels or concrete.<p>What does happen is that we have more and more interesting research areas in which we can investigate the underlying principles that govern our universe. But, we must not make the mistake that we will &quot;know&quot; what those principles will be be. We can and do develop workable and useful models and theories to help us get a handle on understanding this universe we live in. We live on one small planet in an isolated region of our galaxy in an extraordinary and immense universe. We do not kave the ability to explore that universe in any detailed way except by proxy observations. So, instead of getting caught up in being &quot;sure&quot;, let us have fun in exploring everywhere we can and continue to gather data and discuss what this data means and develop workable theories and models that we can use.<p>As a disciple of the living God who created all the that we see and do not see, I consider that the universe has a set of specific rules and laws by which it operates and that we can and should try to understand what those laws are. For me that is an act of worship to investigate and understand the what and how.<p>For those who are of other belief systems, whether that be Hindu, Buddhist, Moslem, Atheists, etc., there is just as much an incentive to study the universe around us and understand what and how it works. There may be additional questions that might be raised from each viewpoint that is not of concern for any of the other viewpoints like &quot;why&quot;.<p>BUt what it all boils down to, is that we live in a wonderful and extremely interesting universe and there is much to learn about it and have fun while learning about it."

"Detroit is an interesting case of how a shrinking city becomes useful for some investors.<p>IIRC, I was looking up the prices of various lots, and many homes were $1000! Now, I don&#x27;t live anywhere close to Detroit, but the idea of spending maybe $10,000 to $100,000 for dozens or even hundreds of houses is interesting.<p>Developing for humans may be a problem: Hundreds-of-thousands of people have left Detroit, leaving the city in the state that it is in today. But the houses and infrastructure (roads, water, electricity) may be useful for some niches, even in a &quot;ghost town&quot; situation (Or perhaps: more of a &quot;ghost suburb&quot; situation. Neighborhoods with shrinking populations will naturally have weaker schools, causing more people to leave, causing taxes to go up on the remaining people, causing more people to leave, etc. etc. Its a bad death-spiral effect).<p>I think I recall an article about how one writers group was buying up neighborhoods to station writers-circles, effectively creating a community of writers imported from around the country to one location, so that the writer-circle can leverage each other as an author support group.<p>I haven&#x27;t heard of this Bee Farm thing, but I would have expected that sort of thing to be better in a more rural community.<p>In any case: redeveloping all of that land and making it useful (as opposed to broken down neighborhoods with crumbling infrastructure) is a big question for Detroit... and investors &#x2F; businessmen.

"There need to be more chargers at places where people park their cars when they are not at home. That is parking lots at the work place and parking lots of malls and supermarkets. Parking at work would need little more than a standard plug, assuming you are 8+ hours at work. At malls and supermarkets, you would have medium-fast chargers, as you are parking for 1-2 hours. 
And with the lastest gen fast-chargers, a recharge can be done in as little as 20-30 minutes, so having a good coffee store with WIFI along with the charging stations (no bad smells at charging stations) should mostly solve the problem for an occasional charge and wait."
"The title calling it &quot;curable&quot; feels a bit misleading.  To explain...<p>Ebola&#x27;s a viral infection, like the common cold or the flu.  If someone gets sick with it, then usually their immune system should fight it off naturally, just like the common cold or the flu.  And just like a cold&#x2F;flu, there hasn&#x27;t really been a cure for it; instead, Ebola sufferers would be put on bed-rest with fluids to resist dehydration, fever management, etc., while the body fights it off.<p>However, Ebola&#x27;s symptoms tend to be severe.  Glancing at Wikipedia&#x27;s figures, it seems that about 50% of people who get it die -- which probably varies a lot by the exact strain, health of the victim, support received while sick, etc..  Many victims end up making a full recovery, though some end up taking more long-term damage from the trauma.<p>As I&#x27;m reading it, they&#x27;ve observed that some victims tend to fight off Ebola with relative success.  So, they appear to be trying to copy those survivors&#x27; defenses via [monoclonal antibodies](<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Monoclonal_antibody"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Monoclonal_antibody</a>), then pass that on to Ebola sufferers.<p>Since they&#x27;re basically optimizing a victim&#x27;s immune system with specially selected antibodies, the victim still suffers Ebola and fights it off as usual, just they&#x27;re getting some pretty powerful backup in that fight.<p>And apparently the results are pretty good so far!  The article reports:<p>&gt; The monoclonal antibody cocktail produced by a company called Regeneron Pharmaceuticals had the biggest impact on lowering death rates, down to 29 percent, while NIAID’s monoclonal antibody, called mAb114, had a mortality rate of 34 percent. The results were most striking for patients who received treatments soon after becoming sick, when their viral loads were still low—death rates dropped to 11 percent with mAb114 and just 6 percent with Regeneron’s drug, compared with 24 percent with ZMapp and 33 percent with Remdesivir.<p>The article exaggerates a bit by citing the mortality rates for people who don&#x27;t receive any support; that seems like an unreasonable figure since this treatment is an advanced form of support, so presumably it&#x27;ll improve the odds of those who <i>do</i> get support.<p>So, if mortality rates are about 50%, then presumably they can drop that to about 29% overall, with people who seek treatment earlier enjoying the greatest benefit with mortality rates dropping to 6%.<p>Realistically speaking, this seems to suggest that this &quot;cure&quot; reduces an individual&#x27;s odds-of-death by a bit shy of 50%; that leaves a lot to be desired.  Still, it&#x27;s awesome because:<p>1. Any progress on something like this is awesome.<p>2. This sort of technology can rapidly improve, so the current positive results may just be the beginning."

"&gt; If you can&#x27;t on your particular Unix, I&#x27;d actually say that your Unix is probably not letting you get full use out of your RAM.<p>What use is &quot;full use&quot; if your system live locks!? This is similar logic to that of overcommit--more &quot;efficient&quot; use of RAM in most cases, with the tiny, insignificant cost of your processes randomly[1] being killed?<p>What happens in practice is that people resort to over provisioning RAM anyhow. But even then that&#x27;s no guarantee that your processes won&#x27;t be OOM-killed. We&#x27;re seeing precisely that in serious production environment--OOM killer shooting down processes even though there&#x27;s plenty (e.g. &gt;10%, tens of gigabytes) of unallocated memory because it can&#x27;t evict the buffer cache quickly enough--where quickly enough is defined by some magic heuristics deep in the eviction code.<p>[1] And before you say that it&#x27;s not random but can be controlled... you really have no idea of the depth of the problem. Non-strict, overcommit-dependent logic is baked deep into the Linux kernel. There are plenty of ways to wedge the kernel where it will end up shooting down the processes that are supposed to be the most protected, sometimes shooting down much of the system. In the many cases people simply reboot the server entirely rather than wait around to see what the wreckage looks like. This is 1990s Windows revisited--reboot and move along, unreliability is simply the nature of computers...."

A lot of these issues (and I must admit I totally lost interest at the point I got to the complaints about message threading, although I did skim to the end[1]) are really personal preference.

I actually prefer it to Slack threads.<p>My main beefs with Teams are:<p>- Performance: it&#x27;s just far too damn slow to switch views.<p>- Awkward to switch back to a channel or another chat whilst on a Teams call.<p>- Connectivity: it&#x27;s better than it was at handling disconnection and reconnection but, overall, it&#x27;s still a ####ing moron and a timesink - you&#x27;re still forced to restart on occasion (which takes too damn long).<p>One thing I do like: when our company switched from Slack to Teams[2] what I very quickly noticed, and what has persisted over the last year(ish) that we&#x27;ve been using it, is the much higher SNR. Maybe it&#x27;s that Teams isn&#x27;t so fun to use but, whatever the reason, there&#x27;s just way less distracting guff being posted and, perhaps to my surprise, it turns out I&#x27;m quite happy with that.<p>Slack gives the appearance of productivity and collaboration without any of its substance. Teams, well, it&#x27;s still an IM system and therefore always going to be subject to some level of wrath from me, but for the most part it feels like it does what it does well enough and doesn&#x27;t try to be the centre of attention quite as much.<p><i>[1] Where I was mildly irked to read, &quot;Microsoft Teams is the solution that nobody asked for the problem that nobody had,&quot; in the conclusion. I mean, really, if you&#x27;re going to say that you ought to be honest enough to acknowledge that you could say the same about any current gen IM app. I certainly never asked for software that would make it even easier for people to keep disturbing me when I&#x27;m in the middle of something else, and I know more than a few people who feel similarly.</i><p><i>[2] Teams came with O365 and losing history with Slack was becoming a problem, but not one that felt like it was worth paying what Slack charge to solve: we felt like there were better ways to use that money, and overall - and after initial reticence - I&#x27;m happy with that decision.</i>"

Back when AMD first introduced the 64 bit extensions to the x86 architecture and directly challenged Intel who was selling 64 bits as a &quot;high end&quot; feature in their Itanium line, it was a place where Intel was unwilling to go (commoditizing 64 bit processors)<p>That proved pretty successful for them. Now they have done it again by commoditizing &quot;high core count&quot; processors.<p>Each time they do this I wonder if Intel will ever learn that you can&#x27;t &quot;get away&quot; with selling something for a lot of money that can be made more cheaply forever. Processors are not a veblen good."
"We currently use Teams and everyone on the team absolutely hates it. I am actively looking at alternatives such as mattermost or slack to get us onto something that doesn&#x27;t run like complete garbage.<p>Also, why did this have to be developed using electron? If Teams were a native application, or even written using something on the .NET-side, we would probably have about 20% the complaints we do today. Watching an application that is more-or-less responsible for managing basic text and image data on a continuously-paginated basis occupy nearly a gigabyte of memory is simply intolerable.<p>Teams makes me want to write a clone just to prove how much better it could be. That is how bad Teams is. It makes me want to spend an entire month&#x27;s worth of weekends writing a native clone that no one will ever use."
"&quot;unsafe implementation language&quot; is a pretty moot point.<p>Looking at all the trivial exploits against web applications which are basically never written in memory-unsafe languages (Ruby, Python, PHP, ...) shows that it doesn&#x27;t really matter much.

"I don&#x27;t have a problem with Apple showing whether the Battery is replaced or using genuine Apple Battery. My problem is that replacement done by Apple is both too costly and too time consuming.<p>Current iPhone X &#x2F; XS &#x2F; XR Battery Replacement is $69, which is roughly double the price of being replaced on streets with similar battery. Now of course there are scammers who tries to replace a crappy battery, but going to well know Repair Shop normally prevent that from happening.<p>I would have no problem paying double the price for an Apple Store replacement, except not only would have I have to wait hours or days for replacement depending on which part of the cities, countries, world you are in. You will also have to wait and go into that awful Apple Store and try and get someone to help. What is an 30 to 45 min job elsewhere, in the worst case you could wait 45 min just to get someone in Apple Store.<p>Here I am paying double the price for <i>worst</i> experience.<p>But that is not the worst part.<p>Apple Refuse to replace your Battery if your screen is broken, has slight crack on the edge, water damage or whatever damage they claim it has. You will first have to pay and fix those <i>damages</i>.
Again I am perfectly fine with paying to fix it, except more than 99% of times Apple will quote you a price roughly 30 - 50% of your iPhone&#x27;s that is now already 2 - 3 years old. And it makes much more sense to buy a new one instead. ( This remind me of the so call logic board damage I had with MacBook Pro 2 years ago. Sometimes I wonder why I am still using Apple )"

Instead, I called the staff to take it away. Maybe they stole it?

"When I was a summer intern for a county computer service facility in the early 80s, they had a big IBM mainframe, and a bespoke program for school bus routing. Every summer, this program consumed a fair amount of the activity for the facility, which contained more than a dozen individual school districts.<p>I don&#x27;t know the extent to which it was capable of <i>optimizing</i> the schedules, but it was considered to be a pretty big deal. There was apparently a lot of hand-coded logic for dealing with things like one-way streets and not wanting bus stops on busy streets."

"Like all industries we can&#x27;t just stay still.
Curiosity and creativity are important. The &quot;olives&quot; are a fruit of some sort of older technology that has matured. Maybe this technology was the &quot;shiny new some some time back then&quot;
Some people try to fix the the shortcommings from yesterday&#x27;s technology with their own ideas and view of things and nobody can prevents this. This is just basic, human creativity at work.<p>Maybe what&#x27;s important is not making people belive that yesterday&#x27;s technology is obsolete and should be burried or abandoned.
The shiny new thing is just an other tool in the toolbox and it&#x27;s not because I created a new shape of screw that all the other screws are worthless. There is still plenty of screws all over the world that need to be unscrewed, we need those tools to do that, people to know how to work with them and some of these screws still need to be made. Maybe people don&#x27;t talk about these screws as much ? They don&#x27;t make the news anymore because they&#x27;ve been there for so long ?<p>Maybe the point here is that social media thrives on the shiny new thing, it&#x27;s the core concept of it. An old news paper is worthless, no one ever sold an older news paper. So they need to grab some attention to live and the shiny new thing is a way to accomplish that.<p>But it&#x27;s not because there is lots of articles about all those new frameworks that the older ones are worthless. We need both. Maybe for some projects we will not choose an architecture based on 10 years old concepts and frameworks and some other projects need stability and a whole tested and stable toolchain and documentation for the years to come.<p>What kind of work do you want to accomplish ? Small projects where you work alone ? Where you just serve a few people ?
Or big projects with a huge infrastructure that needs to deliver to millions with great economic impact ?<p>I bet you don&#x27;t use a hammer only when you want to build kitchen furniture. And then tools that are needed in a factory that build kitchen furniture are not the same that the ones that needs to be used for home. They need a whole supply toolchain, some testing &amp; quality checking. Whereas the worksman in his own workshop is going to have less tools ...<p>We need all kinds of software and technology, maybe what&#x27;s hard is to be able to identify the right ones and defining precisely what we want and where we think we will go.

With supporting medical treatment before this new treatment - fluid support, etc - I think it&#x27;s up to 50%? It sounds like the monoclonal antibody treatment has improved odds of survival from 1:10-1:2 to 2:3.<p>edit: The 6% figure is population restricted to early interventions. I am uncomfortably out of my limited knowledge here, but I think that early intervention numbers are better across the board. I&#x27;d want to compare the 6% number to the control.

If other sources have the info directly then that would be a huge reason that Google wouldn&#x27;t rank this examine.com site highly?<p>How many people google something looking for a for-pay resource that they, it seems, can&#x27;t even sample first?<p>I&#x27;m not googling looking for a site to sign-up with to get emailed a factsheet either, even if it&#x27;s free (which is a common fraud that I&#x27;m hugely wary of).<p>Ok, so now I&#x27;m looking at the questions, cool, click through - something about caffeine interactions with creatine, surely the link is to the cited scientific paper, nope just to another uncited page by the same person.<p>I&#x27;m not impressed upon that this is a site that should be high in google rankings; it seems low value unless you&#x27;re looking to sign up to a resource -- like if I search online for &quot;Steven King novels&quot; I actually want the list, not a link to a library I can sign up to in order to find out at some time in the future some of the novels that could be on that list.<p>FWIW the summary given was good, readable, seemed like it might be true, but there&#x27;s no reason to trust it at all.

"If anyone is having difficulty typing for whatever reason, you may want to check out the dictation-toolbox organization on GitHub [1]. About a decade ago I began developing symptoms from excessive typing on a MacBook Pro (that short key travel distance is a killer). The pain is still pretty persistent, but I have ways of managing and part of that was relying on dictation. When I got started with dictation, I saw several people were solving different parts of the same problem in different ways. The dictation-toolbox organization is my attempt to collate all of that work together.<p>Unfortunately, there&#x27;s not a great out-of-the-box solution and there are several tools in there that still &quot;compete&quot; in some sense. But, at least they&#x27;re all centrally located and devs from the various projects bounce ideas off each other. Each of the devs is very responsive and will help you get started. Pull requests are always welcomed, but even just suggestions for overall improvements are well-received.<p>Whether due to genetics or environment, an injury&#x2F;condition can be annoying enough. Having it also potentially compromise your source of income is just additional stress.  I won&#x27;t say dictation is a silver bullet, but it really helped me out. Hopefully it can help you out as well.<p>Please feel free to reach out to me if you have questions, need help getting started, or want to get involved.<p>[1] -- <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;dictation-toolbox&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;dictation-toolbox&#x2F;</a>"

"Nice work! This is a great idea and something I&#x27;ve thought should exist since getting interested in CBT a few months back. Before even trying the app, here are some thoughts.<p>- On pricing: $4&#x2F;mo seems like a difficult price point to build a business around, and it doesn&#x27;t reflect the value you&#x27;re offering. People pay hundreds&#x2F;thousands per month to therapists to improve their mental health. If outcomes from using your app compare favorably to a therapist, shouldn&#x27;t your pricing reflect that? $4&#x2F;mo makes me think &#x27;toy&#x27;, not serious therapeutic tool. For people to be willing to pay <i>anything</i> for an app like this, they have to be convinced it can really work. But if they <i>are</i> convinced, they&#x27;ll pay a whole lot more than $4&#x2F;mo. I would consider freemium (so people can try it out and see the value) and then a much higher price point (maybe $50-100&#x2F;mo?). You might get undercut by competing apps, but if you&#x27;re clearly the best one, I think many people will want the best option and won&#x27;t be very price-sensitive if they believe it can really help.<p>- On branding: while it&#x27;s important to mention that the app is based on CBT so you can piggyback on the awareness people already have about CBT, I think referring to it as a &quot;Cognitive Behavioral Therapy app&quot; severely restricts your market to people who already know what that means, which I&#x27;d guess is a very small slice of the people who could benefit. I would try to lead with the benefits--feel better quickly; easier, cheaper, more effective than a therapist; evidence-based; etc.--and save the more technical&#x2F;jargony stuff about CBT for supporting info.<p>- On stigma: I would also try to avoid positioning this as something mainly for people experiencing a &#x27;mental illness&#x27; like clinical depression&#x2F;anxiety, but rather something that <i>everyone</i> can benefit from and use to feel better and improve their lives, regardless of how they currently feel. I think many people who don&#x27;t consider themselves to have a serious problem still engage in cognitive distortions and could see major benefits from using CBT techniques, so I would try to include these people in your messaging as well. While going from bad mood to good mood is obviously valuable and desirable, so is going from good mood to great mood. But if you make it seem like using the app is effectively self-identifying as &#x27;mentally ill&#x27; or even just &#x27;feeling bad&#x27;, many folks in the latter camp will be turned off, so that&#x27;s something to be careful about."

"EV had one advantage: It allowed browser vendors to push for improved standards (like Certificate Transparency adoption) with minimal push-back.

"Python has a lot of problems that really slow down development, but they are all fixable.<p>The biggest issue, in my opinion, is in dependency management. Python has a horrible dependency management system, from top-to-bottom.<p>Why do I need to make a &quot;virtual environment&quot; to have separate dependencies, and then source it my shell?<p>Why do I need to manually add version numbers to a file?<p>Why isn&#x27;t there any builtin way to automatically define a lock file (currently, most Python projects just don&#x27;t even specify indirect dependency versions, many Python developers probably don&#x27;t even realize this is an issue!!!!!)?<p>Why can&#x27;t I parallelize dependency installation?<p>Why isn&#x27;t there a builtin way to create a redistributable executable with all my dependencies?<p>Why do I need to have fresh copies of my dependencies, even if they are the same versions, in each virtual environment?<p>There is so much chaos, I&#x27;ve seen very few projects that actually have reproducible builds. Most people just cross their fingers and hope dependencies don&#x27;t change, and they just &quot;deal with&quot; the horrible kludge that is a virtual environment.<p>We <i>need</i> official support for a modern package management system, from the Python org itself. Third party solutions don&#x27;t cut it, because they just end up being incompatible with each other.<p>Example: if the Python interpreter knew just a little bit about dependencies, it could pull in the correct version from a global cache - no need to reinstall the same module over and over again, just use the shared copy. Imagine how many CPU cycles would be saved. No more need for special wrapper tools like &quot;tox&quot;."
You are the problem. Not the tools.
"&quot;... the original definition: languages which have the same external and internal representations are homoiconic.&quot;<p>I would re-phrase that as:
  &quot;Languages whose external and internal representations of their programs are (to a great degree) ISOMORPHIC, are, and should be, called homoiconic.&quot;<p>What does &quot;iconicity&quot; mean? It means isomorphism, meaning the structure of two things are similar, one can be taken to be a picture, an &quot;icon&quot; of the other.<p>Lisp clearly has this property. It is clearly homo-iconic. And most importantly most other languages do NOT have this property. Therefore &quot;homo-iconic&quot; is a very useful property which can be easily used to divide programming languages into two groups, those that are and those that aren&#x27;t.<p>The original definition is bad: &quot;which have the SAME external and internal representations&quot;. &quot;Sameness&quot; is not what homo-iconicity is about. It is about the structures of the external and internal representation being SIMILAR enough that one of them could be considered an ICON, a PICTURE of the other. Perhaps we should stop using words like &quot;similar&quot; as well? They are not &quot;boolean&quot; are they?<p>Clearly &#x27;homo-iconic&quot; has a sound well-founded meaning, even if not everybody gets it. It is a subtle concept similar to understanding why something can be used as a metaphor for another thing. Not everybody gets metaphors either."

"This seems pretty good; the only thing on my mental checklist of &quot;common monad discussion failures&quot; is only a half-point off, because I&#x27;d suggest for:<p>&quot;A monad is a type that wraps an object of another type. There is no direct way to get that ‘inside’ object. Instead you ask the monad to act on it for you.&quot;<p>that you want to add some emphasis that the monad interface itself provides no way to reach in and get the innards out, but that does not prevent <i>specific</i> implementations of the monad interface from providing ways of getting the insides. Obviously, Maybe X lets you get the value out if there is one, for instance. This can at least be inferred from the rest of the content in the post, since it uses types that can clearly be extracted from. It is not a <i>requirement</i> of implementing the monad interface on a particular type&#x2F;class&#x2F;whatever that there be no way to reach inside and manipulate the contents.<p>But otherwise pretty good.<p>(I think this was commonly screwed up in Haskell discussions because the IO monad looms so large, and does have that characteristic where you can never simply extract the inside, give or take unsafe calls. People who end up coming away from these discussions with the impression that the monads literally never let you extract the values come away with the question &quot;What&#x27;s the use of such a thing then?&quot;, to which the correct answer is indeed, yes, that&#x27;s pretty useless. However, specific implementations always have some way of getting values out, be it via IO in the case of IO, direct querying in the case of List&#x2F;Maybe&#x2F;Option&#x2F;Either, or other fancy things in the fancier implementations like STM. Controlling the extraction is generally how they implement their guarantees, if any, like for IO and STM.)"

"When I was in college (almost 20 years ago), I was studying music (piano and electronic music&#x2F;synthesis) which involved many hours at both a piano keyboard and computer keyboard. In my junior year I had intense pain in my wrists and had to ask my CS profs and music profs for extra time to complete assignments. They obliged, and it took about a year of visiting several PTs, doctors and finally a body worker trained in PT to resolve it. She knew that my pain was &quot;referred&quot; pain from nerve issues in my arms and torso (caused of course by bad ergonomics). The wrists were not damaged, only &quot;feeling&quot; the pain from nerves further up the arms that had become constricted. Through simple stretches and good desk ergonomics I have been pain free since.<p>I highly recommend the book &quot;Comfort at Your Computer: Body Awareness Training for Pain-Free Computer Use&quot; by Paul Linden.

While the ion engine of course requires carrying fuel, and is thus governed by the tyranny of the rocket equation and not directly comparable in performance, this engine still requires a power source and thus effectively requires fuel anyway.<p>Also worth mentioning is that the least efficient possible massless thruster, a simple blackbody radiator with reflector to aim all of the photons behind you, is only about 1000x worse than this unit in terms of propulsion force per power, and essentially infinitely better than the unit in terms of propulsion force per mass, since this structure is incredibly massive where as you can usually generate blackbody radiation directly from you power source."

"I played a ton of RTS games, but I still remember fondly Tiberian Sun for the art style.<p>It has a very, very distinct feel from anything else back then, and anything that followed.<p>For me it&#x27;s a combination of many factors. Voxel units looked <i>great</i> at small scale compared to any polygonal type that came after that. The infantry and landscape is 2D and hand-crafted. It&#x27;s gorgeous. I think this was the last game in the series where this was the case. Dynamic and scripted lighting, esp nearby tiberium, added a ton to make some of the landscapes really look alien and alive - but did so without changing the vibe of the game. The soundtracks were very fitting as well, although not as memorable as C&amp;C RA.<p>I&#x27;m not nostalgic here. I really did like subsequent games in the series. RA2 was great. I had lots of fun with Generals too (which I always thought looked stunning).<p>But Tiberian Sun has really a _distinct_ feel to it encompassing everything. RIP Westwood."

"As someone who casually came across Examine.com a while back, I left quickly simply because the website didn&#x27;t seem credible. As others have pointed out here, the website&#x27;s design (while looks nice) does not send all the right signals that this is a well-established research website. I know it&#x27;s not good to judge a book by its cover, but online, the cover is everything.<p>I know this sounds anal, but if they were to simply clean up the site a bit like by removing all the excessive icons and cleaning up their button text, they would come across as more credible.<p>Perhaps if they came across as more credible, people wouldn&#x27;t be leaving and google wouldn&#x27;t get the wrong signals.<p>Simple and quick list of changes that would make their site feel more trustworthy:<p>1. Remove most if not all of the icons
2. Do away with borders on non-white background - basically just make background white. 
3. Tone down your button text. &quot;I&#x27;m ready to learn&quot; sounds really shitty and obnoxious. 
4. Stop screaming with all caps buttons
5. Consider a different logo entirely. 
6. Consider different color palette entirely
7. Do away with old button styles
8. Restore normal font size to sources - right now it makes me feel like you are hiding them. 
9. List author credentials on every content page
10. Do away with ugly callout styles and excessive icon usage
11. Re-work all the weird &quot;Scientific Research on ___&quot; tabs so that they do not require so much clicking to find basic info.<p>Overall, the site is just over-designed. I realize everything I say would make the site look more WebMD-like, but that&#x27;s what triggers trust when it comes to medical info sites.<p>Lastly, I fully expect to be downvoted for this as design is not something that&#x27;s very respected around these corners of the web, but I felt it was important to make that point since this is a perfect example of a website that while looks great, does the opposite of creating a trustworthy browsing experience."
"Some Philips sonicare toothbrushes use(d) a <i>4-bit</i> microcontroller from an obscure Swiss company. (From memory, since I can&#x27;t find the EEVBlog video teardown) 52 bytes of RAM, custom size mask ROM, ? Kilohertz clock speed. It makes sense, they just needed a timer for the &quot;2 minutes of brushing is up&quot; feature, and maybe some battery management.

"Apple salaries aren’t much of a secret, see: levels.fyi.<p>1M is a lot of money to me, a regular person, but when you consider that top security engineering talent could be making north of 500k in total compensation, 1M suddenly doesn’t seem all that impressive.<p>It’s a good bet to make on their risk.

Big companies and startups look good by supporting expanded foreign worker programs. It makes them look progressive. It also lowers their costs to have more qualified workers around.<p>But actually I know many local (US citizen) Silicon Valley programmers who don’t support those programs. They know that more workers means lower salaries for everyone.
"I think proponents of this change are dramatically underestimating how difficult and limiting it will be to maintain seamless interop between two dialects of a language. Interop between languages is <i>hard</i>, and many of the features and changes that you might like to add to a &quot;P++&quot; would make it either expensive or verbose to call or be called by &quot;legacy&quot; PHP. Ultimately I think this could go one of two ways:<p>A. The &quot;P++&quot; effort ends up hamstrung by the need to maintain seamless interop with &quot;legacy&quot; PHP, and is therefore only able to implement a small subset of the clean-ups and enhancements they envision. It&#x27;s not clear that this is better than continuing to improve PHP in a backwards-compatible way.<p>B. Changes to P++ make it so that interop with &quot;legacy&quot; PHP is either very verbose (specifying types, casting, etc.) or incurs a heavy runtime cost. To avoid this, most significant PHP libraries get a P++ clone, and the language effectively forks into two separate communities.<p>It would be awesome if it&#x27;s possible to avoid this, but I haven&#x27;t seen a specific technical proposal for a significantly improved language that maintains seamless interop."

The first thing that came to mind when I read the opening paragraphs regarding churn is developing mobile applications.

"This is an example of where desktop and server engineers could benefit from having embedded design experience.<p>It&#x27;s certainly possible to create a small, protected area of memory that contains a kernel-level interrupt handler (which itself allocates no memory) whose sole job is to run a couple of times a second and check for thrashing and OOM. If it sees memory problems, it takes over the computer, determines which processes are using the most memory and kills the ones that are expendable. (&quot;Expendable&quot; is a list configurable by the user and yeah, Chrome would be right at the top for a desktop system.)<p>Embedded systems designers routinely build such watchdogs into their systems. It could probably be added to Linux as a kernel patch."
"Somewhat related - when I was working at Union Pacific in 2011, there was a hugely expensive effort to replace the old 1024x768 monitors in the locomotives with 1080p equivalents, including redesigning a lot of the UIs to work in a wide screen form factor.<p>After the rollout completed, all the feedback was negative, saying that the fonts were too small to read on the new displays, especially when the locomotive began vibrating at speed.<p>In the end, the whole fleet had a software update pushed out that set the resolution back to 1024x760, and all the UIs looked stretched.  The engineers (train, not software) were ecstatic.<p>Lesson to take away is that with user interaction, it’s important to look at how humans will actually be using the system.  That seems self evident, but given stories like these clearly isn’t."

So when I have calls from recruite I kinda skip the tech stuff, since it won&#x27;t be the issue anyway. I&#x27;m more intersted in how much the company really does DevOps and Agile.
I just recently declined a job opportunity bc the company wanted to buy this modern DevOps stuff but actually couldn&#x27;t risk an actual change.<p>The customer I currently working for is a mess. It&#x27;s a middle sized company who has to finish 3 projects at the same time and do neither the &quot;new world&quot; nor the &quot;old world&quot;
They overthrown a lot of the old world rules and took a lot of power from the project managers.
But what they are doing now is taking random parts of the new world and implement it in a broken way and say &quot;we are modern!&quot;
Like this they are doing neither of it and they end up with basically just chaos.
Companies often want a change without having a change. And for me it&#x27;s kinda annoying to run against corporate walls, when I was hired (as an expensive external!) to solve those problems but then getting ignored.
So they throw more people at the problem and just churn them. As you guys already know, what 1 guy in IT can do within 1 day, 2 guys can do it in 2 days.<p>P.S.: I&#x27;m planning to relocate from germany to NY. If someone needs a DevOps, give me a shoutout to: jjdjnrjfifj@gmail.com
Also open for non-work contacts. Don&#x27;t want to be alone in NY"
I love Ted Chiang. My favourite is &quot;Hell is the absence of God&quot; from the collection &quot;Stories of your life&quot;. It drew me in.
"I know this article was about how commodore screwed up there marketing on the Amiga, but all those references to software, publications, and developers just took me on a nostalgia trip back to my 15 year old self pining for an Amiga as I worked in a farmer&#x27;s fields all summer long to be able to buy one, and after I finally got one I spent many late nights teaching myself to code up some Homebrew bbs software for it."
"I find it not ideal from Blackhat to remove this talk.<p>They paid to speak, so why not leave it at that. In many ways the guy hacked Blackhat with a few thousand dollars, which is kinda noteworthy.<p>This guy certainly gets all the attention he wanted by Blackhat removing the video."
Is it fair to say that Python is the new BASIC?
"When I first saw one of these I went inside and asked what the deal was. I immediately wanted to try it out as a challenge to myself, but then they told me it was really meant for groups. Silly introvert me."
"Definitely - I&#x27;ve been doing this for about five years with all my machines. A rough overview of the setup:<p>- A public repository with a Nix configuration file: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gitlab.com&#x2F;victor-engmark&#x2F;root"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gitlab.com&#x2F;victor-engmark&#x2F;root</a>. This does the global setup, installing applications, configuring global services, enabling hardware, etc, and gets me 90% of the way to identical machines with a single `nixos-rebuild switch`.<p>- A public repository with dotfiles and main application configuration: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gitlab.com&#x2F;victor-engmark&#x2F;tilde"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gitlab.com&#x2F;victor-engmark&#x2F;tilde</a>. Allows me to configure user applications once for all my machines.<p>- A private repository with secrets such as SSH keys and host-specific configuration like video drivers, screen layout etc.<p>This makes it possible to get from a fresh OS install to a developer workstation with everything from keyboard layout to my favourite window manager configured as I like it within minutes.<p>I consider learning configuration management a nice bonus of this setup, but of course that is not for everyone.<p>The biggest problem with this is how many programs seem to go out of their way to make their configuration hard to version control. Firefox moved to SQLite for everything years ago, but at least there&#x27;s the Sync service. Some applications reorder configuration items every time they save (I&#x27;ve built scripts to order them properly). And others include things which IMO don&#x27;t belong in &quot;user&quot; configuration files such as window size, recently opened files and which configuration tab was last open.<p>PS: I recently moved to Nix on NixOS from Puppet (similar features to Ansible and Chef) on Arch Linux for the system configuration. Nix has several massive advantages over at least Puppet and Ansible, both of which I&#x27;ve used a fair bit:<p>- <i>Much</i> shorter configuration. For example, `services.fail2ban.enable = true;` is enough to install, enable and start a fail2ban service when building the configuration, and `time.timeZone = &quot;Pacific&#x2F;Auckland&quot;;` means I don&#x27;t have to even think about where that piece of configuration is stored, or in which of the infinite formats used for Linux configuration.<p>- Trivial rollback to earlier configurations, during runtime or at the boot menu. This saved my backside when I screwed up a GRUB-related setting - just reboot and select the previous configuration.<p>- You can install applications as a non-root user to try them out.<p>- I&#x27;ve been using Nix for less than a month, but it&#x27;s far easier to just get stuff done with it than with Puppet or Ansible, and the end results so far are just generally nicer.<p>So if you want a simple system configuration you can copy around to configure everything the same way I would thoroughly recommend NixOS."
"In my opinion, the biggest problem facing Python is still concurrency. The mitigation efforts still look to me like Perl&#x27;s &#x27;bolted on&#x27; implementation of object orientation. Python should have gotten rid of the GIL during the 2 to 3 transition. It may have also been an opportune moment to introduce optional typing and maybe even optional manual memory management, making it useful to develop almost all kinds of software. Write a WASM backend and it could have even been used for front end development."
"If I ever get rich enough to do so, I&#x27;m going to buy some land somewhere - perhaps old farming land that&#x27;s no longer profitable, and just let it return to nature. Let the trees and bushes grow, let the insects, birds and whatever else breed there.<p>I&#x27;m beginning to think that&#x27;s one of the best things one could do for the planet right now."
This is super cool! I&#x27;d be really curious to see how the messaging to particular demographics compares as well. Wild that the Trump campaign is spending so much money...
"For Windows, I use a PowerShell that launches a install of Choco followed by a bunch of Choco installs. For Mac, I have a bash script that installs homebrew then runs a bunch of brew and cask commands, installs xcode utils, and then command lines some App Store installs that aren’t available from cask."
"Bobby Tables started school in 2007, so he&#x27;d be around 17 today, seems about right."
"It&#x27;s not their job to send anyone traffic, search engines are about information retrieval, getting traffics off of them is a side-effect that is being phased out.<p>The less clicks a user has to make to get an answer the better experience it is for them."

A word about the &quot;faggot&quot; usage: it was a necessary tool. It showed three things: they were not in control, if they were the usage would have be stopped. Everyone out there needed to see t%his. Two, it made it unpleasant for them to be in the headspace, which has obvious advantages. Three, it pointed out impersonators of BS because they would not call each other faggot, thus helping to mitigate the spread of false information. Apologies for those unintentionally offended.<p>Of special interest to the LGBT community, I give you Barack Obama in a foursome with Peter Thiel, Jack Dorsey, and Matthew Porter.

"It’s interesting that most AI models focus on learning, but in biology the heavy lifting was all done in the developmental evolution and neurogenesis.

"FWIW, I find that the political discussions here are still a lot better than in most other places on the internet and sometimes I find them quite valuable.<p>For example, I have a pretty solid attitude against genetically enhanced food and where I live, there are quite some people who think likewise (central Europe). But through HN I learned, that there are other places in the world, where such food can significantly improve the lives of many humans and where educated people can&#x27;t understand how on earth you can possibly be against using such technology.<p>I find such insights very valuable because it shows me how limited and filtered ones real-live perception can be."
"I&#x27;ve recently employed a docker-based strategy for this. I work for multiple clients, some of whom go months between giving me work.<p>Each client has their own docker-compose setup on my machine - and I have a secondary machine that I rsync the dockerfiles and some supporting scripts[1] over to for out-and-about. I have a couple of scripts for generating the docker templates for new projects.<p>This means I only need to manually set up three things on a new machine: Docker, a password manager, and a text editor (I&#x27;m using Atom, but Vimmers &#x2F; Emaxions could probably roll this into the template generator)<p>Depending on how locked-down your setup is, you might find that as time goes on and distros go out of support, you need to update your dockerfiles - but I think you&#x27;d need to make those kinds of tweaks with any system.<p>Note that I no longer advocate a dockerfile per-project, but per-client (or some other sub-structure) - that way, production dockerfiles don&#x27;t interfere with developer dockerfiles. Some day, I&#x27;d like to experiment with &quot;sidecar&quot; containers instead... some serious advantages there.<p>[1] Supporting scripts include the templates, a few bash aliases, an easy way to find the ip of a docker machine, an easy way to open a bash shell within a docker container, etc."

"I&#x27;ve been using puppet for everything for 8 years now. I try to avoid using the pre-built modules so that I know what everything is doing but I do use a few. There&#x27;s a base config I use everywhere and then some modules that are specific to my workstation and some that are specific to servers. Makes it really easy to bring up a new personal laptop&#x2F;desktop&#x2F;server and have a great base setup (passwordless ssh, a tinc overlay VPN, automatic upgrades, root emails that show up in my inbox, etc) as well as making it very easy to bring up new services (e.g., a new website is just a few tweaks and a deploy) or migrate between machines.<p>Couldn&#x27;t recommend it more. I started with puppet which seemed most robust at the time but I&#x27;m sure one of the others would do the same. Having all your configs in a single git repository and easy to deploy from a central point is great. And once you have that doing things like centrally managing keys (great for ssh and tinc) becomes really easy."
"This is the problem with overly aggressive legislation. The big companies performed well, the small companies ignored the law, and the medium sized companies tried to comply and failed. You can’t legislate good behavior because people will always find a way around the laws. The legal philosophy behind GDPR seems to be nothing more than to make everyone a criminal and then choose who to prosecute, and in that case why have laws at all rather than letting law enforcement punish whoever they choose?<p>At the end of the day this incentivizes big companies to comply with the laws because they can afford the necessary legal teams and the laws provide a moat to their entrenched power. It incentivizes small companies to ignore the laws just like the move fast and break things mentality of Silicon Valley. The people it hurts are the medium sized, growing companies who are best positioned to fight the big monopolies but are now being held back by well meaning but over burdensome legislation.<p>The good side of GDPR is that it’s trying to advocate for consumer privacy, which overall is a good thing. The issue is that it’s not a legal problem. In the same way you can’t declare drugs to be illegal and expect the supply of drugs to instantly disappear, you can’t declare misuse of data illegal and expect the same. As long as the data has value there will be a market for it, so why not draft sensible regulations instead of trying to solve the problem with laws."

I was really impressed when I got a new MacBook this year. With my previous Windows machines it was always one or two days of reinstalling everything and then a few more weeks until I had all my settings back.

"My $0.02: statistics is generally not very &quot;sensitive&quot; to underlying data -- it deals with small numbers of dimensions&#x2F;features and lots of similar examples and classification is about falling within easily understood bounds.<p>Machine learning, on the other hand, can be extremely &quot;sensitive&quot; to underlying data -- it deals with high numbers of dimensions&#x2F;features on potentially extremely sparse data sets, and a small change in one of them could result in a radically different classification.

The only language which performed worse than it in terms of pure power consumption was Perl.<p>While I&#x27;m sure these results aren&#x27;t exactly indicative of day-to-day usage as they&#x27;re based off of benchmarks which are not exactly representative of day to day use cases it nevertheless raises the question of whether Python is an appropriate choice of language where the application itself is likely to see a high level of total use. I suspect the answer is &quot;more work needs to be done&quot; on the subject to truly assess the impact  and a big part of the answer is &quot;depends on how you&#x27;re using it&quot;. It&#x27;d be good to see some standardised tests of web frameworks. For instance, load testing a standardised server side version of the TodoMVC project to determine what happens for each framework there, along with what happens when you stick a cache in front of them and so on.<p>It&#x27;d also be interesting to attempt to estimate how much power consumption and hence CO2 generation each given programming language is responsible for given their marketshare and typical usage profiles - although I suspect in practice this would be quite difficult given the diverse usage profiles of modern programming languages. And obviously the fact that machine learning libraries, for instance, will naturally be quite energy intensive - it&#x27;s probably the case that Python actually does quite well there because most of its popular libraries for that are just wrapping C or similar rather than being pure Python code.<p>Given the success of V8 and PHP7 in terms of boosting the performance and presumably energy efficiency profile of their respective languages it&#x27;d be nice to see the mainline CPython interpreter undertaking a similar kind of transformation. Obviously we have things like PyPy but it seems to me the Python community needs to be united around a solution to this which forks simply are not going to be able to drive."

There is also conditional configuration for Mac OS X for when I have to work on someone else&#x27;s machines.<p>I do not automate operating system or package installation (I also get new hardware &quot;every couple of years,&quot; and all the machines have different software installed), but the installed package list (`apt-mark showmanual` on Debian and `pkg_info -m` on OpenBSD) is part of the backups, so I can restore or bring up a new machine from the list quickly.<p>Reference and media files are synced with Unison, my personal notes and projects are in git repositories, and mail is synced with offlineimap.<p>I find the above makes it easy to bring up new machines and, more important, effortless to keep the relevant configurations on multiple machines consistent, while not getting in the way of differences (different software on different machines, software compiled from source vs installed via the package manager).<p>I plan to start using GuixSD in the near future, and look forward to using it to automate server and virtual machine configuration and provisioning."

"We&#x27;ve been investigating using these features for some compute intensive workloads to see if we can keep some things inside the database that would normally have to break out to a separate compute service. The biggest problem really is this:<p>&gt; .... if a parallel plan is not produced, refer to the PostgreSQL documentation on parallelism for details.<p>That is, there are a number of incidental features of queries that can silently disable parallelism. It becomes an art of knowing what will trip it off and another thing you have to test and think about while working with your queries.<p>Other than that however, it&#x27;s extremely powerful to be able to use these features and I&#x27;m hopeful we&#x27;ll be able to avoid a whole lot of bespoke compute services we&#x27;d otherwise need to make just to do certain compute operations in a timely manner."

They put the best schools up as &#x27;choice school&#x27; lottery, which means no bus, and if you live within two miles of a school, no bus.  Even if you offer to pay.  Of the 600 students in my child&#x27;s school, 400 spend 45 minutes in a line twice a day, most due to the circumstances.  Obviously not an effective use of time, or good for the environment, I&#x27;m a bit taken back by just how awkward bussing is in the US.

"Desktop machine?  Swap.  For some reason you have a single server and don&#x27;t care about performance?  Swap.  Running an application that might have a working set thats larger than RAM and the application doesn&#x27;t understand how to do its own disk paging?  Swaps good there!<p>Larger scale systems with redundancy?  No swap.<p>Having swap in systems like this still doesn&#x27;t make sense to me.  It treads heavily on the &quot;cattle not pets&quot; philosophy.  I shouldn&#x27;t be ssh-ing into a machine thats swapping to see whats up.  It should be killed.  One server in the cluster starts swapping and falls out of step with its peers?  It should be killed.  When a machine starts swapping it falls into a while different performance regime than the rest of your systems, now you&#x27;ve got more variance in your response times.  Not good when you care about your response times.  Unless you have memory-pretending-to-be-disk for swap (in which case why isn&#x27;t it just memory)<p>I&#x27;ve never seen a machine &#x27;act funny&#x27; because it didn&#x27;t have swap, its always the other way around.  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever encountered a machine that used so much memory that the kernel didn&#x27;t have buffers, but not so much that it invoked OOM killer.  Unless there was a woefully misconfigured process running on the machine.<p>If a machine is well utilized CPU wise it is going to get absolutely crushed when it starts swapping.<p>Time and time again I see swap being an issue.  The past year I&#x27;ve been in a Large Scale shop which for some ungodly reason it has swap (nowhere I&#x27;ve been in the past 10 years as swap as a general rule)<p>Don&#x27;t even get me started with EBS IOPS exhaustion when you start swapping onto an EBS volume."

"<i>There are many problems with using a MITM proxy, however.

"The most informative comment I’ve heard about Chinese business is that one needs to take the western conception of state &#x2F; military &#x2F; corporation and chuck them out the window. In essence these are all descriptive functions of the same entity in China, and any apparent separation is just that—apparent.<p>I know some may reply that, for example, Lockheed effectively lives at this nexus also. It’s a good argument, and probably similar though not exactly the same in arrangement.<p>To me, the most interesting difference is that China has this kind of relationship with its major players regardless of industry, not just their defense contractors. So it doesn’t matter if you make cell phones, video games, toilet seats, ship hulls, or concrete—the whole concept of an enterprise not being interdependent on the state is a non-starter there. Whether it’s happening via backchannels to party officials or through ownership schemes like this one, the concept of private and public sector is so muddy there as to be almost meaningless.<p>To me, this tells us a lot more about IP infringement and espionage than what we usually read, because where the west likes to conceive of corporations as competing in a market in China it’s more useful to describe corporations as tools of statecraft.<p>Huawei wants us to think of them as competing with Apple because they both make cellphones. In reality, it’s as though the CIA or Mossad was competing with Apple—the aims of each may in fact be orthogonal to each other because market performance is not the real driver of the company’s decisions."
What I don&#x27;t understand about quantum physics is why doesn&#x27;t everything just become a statistical smudge after a couple iterations?  Why is reality so coherent?<p>My takeaway is that this is the reason some physicists claim &#x27;everything is information&#x27; because there is some underlying form that gives the statistical quantum physics a consistent pattern instead of devolving into randomness.

"So Apple&#x27;s take is probably: A bunch of people get mad when their iPhones stop working, start running slow, etc; research data shows that when they need a battery replaced, they&#x27;re more likely to go to the local third party (non-authorized) repair shop and get it replaced. We have no idea how skilled or unskilled these repair shops are, even if they use genuine Apple batteries. Our best bet for maintaining the reputation of our product is to make sure only Genius bar or AASP staff install the batteries and run the necessary diagnostics post-install.<p>I don&#x27;t agree that they should be doing the battery authentication thing, replacing your battery is pretty easy and simple; but you have to look at this from Apple&#x27;s standpoint:<p>Yes, Louis Rossmann runs a repair shop that is better than the Genius bar in every way and, should he join Apple, all of their repairability issues would disappear overnight. The issue is that many (most likely a majority) of local computer repair shops that get asked &quot;can you fix this battery error on my iPhone&quot; aren&#x27;t on par with Louis Rossmann and will make mistakes such as improper installation, not re-sealing the phone for water resistance, using non-genuine batteries, etc. Apple could, by all means, make the process easier, cheaper, and more idiot-proof, but that would require engineering efforts. The best course of action, both for making money from repairs and not losing money to engineering and possible product changes (&quot;don&#x27;t sacrifice form for function&quot;, at least under Jony Ive), is to get the software to verify that Apple had complete control over the replacement battery from factory to phone."

"Do many people speak to themself in the third person? It seems kind of odd in my opinion since we usually think of people that speak about themselves in the third person as being self absorbed, eccentric, or both. I do often take on the role of a third party in my own thoughts. For example, if I am fixing something on my house and not 100% sure of the results. It may seem ok to me or my wife, but then I think of the previous owner (a very meticulous person named Tim) and think “what would Tim have to say about this”. Then I proceed to scrutinize things from their perspective. It’s not really the same thing, but I think it serves a similar purpose and doesn’t seem so internally awkward."

"&gt;The uncertainty principle If it happens on a sufficiently large scale, the practice of tweaking quality in lieu of price could play havoc with essential economic data. Statistical agencies do their best to account for changing product quality, but if adjustments are unexpectedly common or subtle then muted inflation figures could easily be concealing a more turbulent economic picture. Central banks watching for big swings in inflation or wage growth as a sign of trouble could be reacting to figures that bear far less relation to business conditions than they used to.<p>&gt;What’s more, the substitution of quality for price as firms’ main way of responding to changing market conditions weakens the case for keeping inflation low and stable. Inflation makes relative prices less informative, economists reckon, making it harder to decide what to buy and how to spend. Rather than clarity, low inflation has brought a different sort of confusion: one of shrinking chocolate bars and lost holidays.<p>What has long been suspected by those outside the field, and rarely acknowledged by economists and statisticians inside the field. Consumer Price Index (CPI), a standard methodology of nearly every national bureau of statistics and economic measurement is susceptible to manipulation and gaming by producers and retailers because the statistical agencies employ limited resources to perform quality adjustments to the item price data.<p>The adjustment methodology is quite limited in what adjustments are made and the resources dedicated to comparing items and differences—there is no lab testing being performed and the most extensive research performed on some items is using product brochure data to make adjustments based on listed features at face value only (the brochure says this is better or comes with better features).<p>Often product data is limited so no adjustments are made, only assumptions like “we believe this product has the same quality or content” or “we will impute the missing price or data based on similarly available data or some kind of modeling abstraction.”<p>This standard methodology led by the U.S. BLS and other agencies has done a complete disservice to the reputability of economics as a hard science instead of a bureaucratic ideology."

Only two things I had to change IIRC was to create the same group as Ubuntu with GID 1000 (100 on TW) and to find out the different package names because ubuntu is a mess.<p>The process that lead me to my current setup<p>- Install OS fresh (always using the same username because there are many cases where you can&#x27;t eval or access env&#x27;s)<p>- Ignore most of the $XDG folders except Desktop and

"While I use more than just Python in my work, it remains my go-to toolset for a range of tasks.  For instance, Python offers the best interactive programming experience of any language today.  You can step through code flow and inspect values with great ease.  This is particularly valuable during prototyping, as you are getting a handle on interactions between your application and third party dependencies.  Further, as designs take shape, you can quickly assemble a proof of concept and learn how to address a problem or design.  Python can be used with little or any inheritance. Adopt a compositional style. You can assign types.  You don&#x27;t need to use all of its bells and whistles if you don&#x27;t want to.  This allows you to use Python in a way that streamlines it for porting to a strongly typed, high performance language such as Rust, should the need or desire to do so ever arise.<p>The Python community is truly global, hosting local events in hundreds of countries.  So many talented, helpful people have been dedicated to the language and community over a very long period of time.  Look at its ecosystem on GitHub to get an idea of how that manifests.  Questions about how to solve a problem are often a single search away from being answered on Stack Overflow, Google groups and countless channels on Freenode IRC. Python conferences are a great place to learn and connect."

One difference is that in Machine Learning you must think of data structures and algorithms. i.e. the practical ways to compute a model. How to represent and transform data while building a model. I think this is given less emphasis in statistics. Standard models are often used and theory is built around these different models. For example aspects such as power calculations for a regression model.

"The role the article describes is usually called a VP of Engineering.  The distinction between them is that VP Eng is an operational role - you&#x27;re responsible for managing a team of developers; instituting the appropriate process to keep productivity high and bug count low; dealing with technical debt; identifying portions of the codebase that won&#x27;t scale and replacing them with solutions that will; and all of the nitty-gritty organizational tasks needed to ensure that the engineering organization doesn&#x27;t grind to a halt.<p>The CTO role is a visionary one.  You&#x27;re responsible for looking outside the organization at new technological developments and deciding how they may impact the organization&#x27;s strategy; identifying new technical areas that warrant some exploratory investment; prototyping new systems, sometimes with the help of a small team of engineers who enjoy that stuff; and advocating for innovation within the organization.<p>Think of the role of Larry &amp; Sergey (technically Presidents of Product&#x2F;Technology, respectively) vs. Urs Hoelzle (VP Eng) at early Google.  Larry &amp; Sergey were responsible for making sure that things like GMail, Google Maps, 20% time, Chrome, etc. got funded and Keyhole, Android, Blogger, Writely, etc. got bought.  Urs instituted the engineering culture, made sure the right engineers got into the right roles and were able to be productive, technical debt got paid down (slowly), new systems were written as necessary to scale, etc.<p>The CTO role, properly defined, is the <i>perfect</i> place to kick a technical founder upstairs and yet still retain their expertise in innovation.  The problem is that many CEOs conflate the two roles, assign VP responsibilities to a CTO with a personality type more suited for the CTO role, never hire a real VP, and then wonder why the organization devolves into chaos.  If you&#x27;re doing it right the bulk of the engineering organization should report up through the VP of Engineering and the CTO should have only a small number of special-projects reports."

"Exploiting choke points to optimise your tactical positioning is a recurring trope. Some games just expect you to do that anyway. As mrob mentioned [0], roguelikes are notorious for this; but I wouldn&#x27;t call that <i>bad</i>. It&#x27;s more a matter of taste. Particularly in roguelikes, you&#x27;ll also encounter situations where the tactical advantage is subverted by enemies that can teleport or spawn minions behind you.<p>One common, but somewhat clunky countermeasure is to start the fight only once you&#x27;re inside an arena and lock down the exits until the adversaries are defeated. It&#x27;s present in many genres, from metroidvanias to ostensibly tactical action (e.g. the Metal Gear Solid series).<p>In a Quake-style FPS, having power-ups not just available, but regularly re-spawning in exposed locations is a tried and true mechanic that maintains an exhilarating ballet between risk and reward. But how could one translate the elegant flow of this gameplay loop to a more realistic (or less artificially &#x27;gamey&#x27;) setting? As Andrew says in the article, you could make more linear and scripted encounters. Which is fine for story-driven games, but limits player agency.<p>If you&#x27;d prefer more organic, emergent game-play, there are other options. Instead of initiating combat only upon the player approaching a set piece, opening a monster closet, or crossing a trigger, you can instruct enemy AI to patrol the potential avenues a stealthy player might take and guard the choke points a speed-runner might attempt to barrel through. From there, you can temper the utility of the player retreating. There could be speedy mobs you wouldn&#x27;t want to turn your back on. Level design that enables flanking — implement a nav mesh that guides your agents to split between chasing the player down and heading her off at the pass.<p>But none of that is objectively superior to more predictable fights. Nor is it guaranteed to to be perceived as more enjoyable than comparatively random encounters. Ultimately, what you really should avoid is a ruleset that keeps players from having fun because the interesting game play loops you intended to happen end up being trumped by dominant strategies that are obviously better for approaching the victory condition, but more boring and tedious to execute.<p>The actual problem isn&#x27;t with players figuring out how to exploit doorways. It&#x27;s rather that moment when they resign to repeating the same move ad nauseam.<p>[0] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=20663044"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=20663044</a>"

"It&#x27;s worse than that. It is all baked into our daily tools. Even HN as a community and a forum aids in distraction. Pretty much any community that lets you form an echo chamber around yourself (all social networks, and communities including HN)commands your attention by making you interact with people who think like you. If this were done in real life it would be much different, but the online medium of it falls short in the tangible relationship department.<p>I hate to say it, but the big nasty &quot;R&quot; word might be the only way to curb the disease of distraction by limiting notifications and psychologically abusive features.<p>The extend of psychological abuse for attention seeking is so great now that most if not all of us are in some way affected, even if we deny it (myself included).<p>Major offenders:
- Twitter - notifications, likes, comments, emails, notifications in tab titles
- FB - notifications, messenger, likes, comments, friend recommendations.
- Slack .. good luck making those little notification circles disappear if you are in a number of different channels
- Linked In - constant emails, people who have looked at your profile, messenger you can&#x27;t close<p>It&#x27;s also going to get worse. As automation grows, more and more people will find themselves occupied with bullshit jobs, the kinds that look to expand and capture a piece of the attention economy. There is a good chance you, the person reading this right now has a bullshit job. You may even know it and acknowledge it, but will ultimately justify it as necessary and a force for good (sorry, it&#x27;s probably not). It&#x27;s a tragedy, but a lot of talent, time and life is being wasted on increasingly larger number of bullshit activities that add absolutely nothing (except $$) and take away everything (time).<p>I should know all of this as I work in a bullshit industry, doing bullshit things, taking people&#x27;s time &amp; money. I am not happy about it but I see no real alternative in the foreseeable future. My job involves figuring out how people think, what will make them buy and then making them buy crap they don&#x27;t need or in more quantities than they need it.<p>Personally, I have made significant effort to cut down on distractions but I still fail by coming to HN. I can&#x27;t help that discussions here are engaging and make me think. Twitter is another platform I have tried quitting many times but find myself too curious to see what&#x27;s happening and checking again. I&#x27;ve managed to cut Reddit down to 1 sub, but even then it seems really difficult to quit that last piece. I still check LinkedIN occasionally but don&#x27;t expect much from it, nor do I care about what&#x27;s being discussed. FB is totally out of my life, including messenger so I have made some progress there. Slack also totally gone. I completely uninstalled it and direct people to email. Speaking of email, I am almost always at inbox zero thanks to a ton of filters. Stuff still gets through from spammers and occasional subscriptions that want to push crap I don&#x27;t care about, but I manage to zap those with the &quot;mark as spam&quot; button quickly."

Jane Goodall has created quite a bunch of problems for Africans and I certainly won&#x27;t class her as &quot;hypersane&quot;.
"Hypersane sounds a little smug, but it feels close to something.<p>Like, there seems to be a difference between how smart a person is, and being [effective? rational? non-reactive? introspective?].<p>It feels like there&#x27;s a spectrum of to which extent people are programmed by, and are reacting to, their environment. A spectrum that might be separate from how smart they are. Give them a text-book or an IQ-test and they&#x27;ll do great, give them the news and they&#x27;ll ineffectually berate and hate each-other, and so on.<p>So while a sane person might have a common social programming, an insane persons programming would be corrupted&#x2F;deviant.<p>And a &quot;hypersane&quot; person would be someone who is more able to see their own (and others) programming, and to a greater extent be able to opt-out of some of it?<p>Maybe there are better words for it."

Another possible interpretation is that the legal system around Skidmore was completely unable to convict a repeat violent offender (McElroy), leading to a widespread (correct) belief that the legal system would not also provide any kind of useful restraint to future offenders.

Therefore, you cannot tell, based purely on their actions, whether they are winning (where winning is defined purely based on the individual&#x27;s value system). Therefore, it is impossible to tell if an individual is &quot;hypersane&quot; or insane.<p>The whole concept is meaningless and sounds like something people would think is &quot;very deep&quot; while stoned."

"EDIT: Per Betelgeuse90 comment below, my characterization of the situation was incorrect. Apple&#x27;s behavior is anti-competitive. I am leaving my original comment here for posterity.<p>Original comment:<p>I love jumping on the apple hate train as much as the next person, but this is not a valid reason to do so.<p>Depending on the aftermarket battery, those reported values could be completely wrong &#x2F; misleading to the user. If you are looking for proof, just buy a random battery off amazon for your computer and tell me how accurate the current reported charge is.<p>Plus, I would like to know if a used device I buy has a non-OEM battery. As long as it stays in that settings screen and doesn&#x27;t turn into a consistent annoying pop-up (or doesn&#x27;t stop the user from upgrading, as was the case with the home button debacle of days passed) I don&#x27;t think this deserves the outrage.<p>Also, the title is a bit misleading. Nothing is being locked, the device functions as it should. An ideal solution would be that apple allows third party battery manufacturers to go through a certification process so apple could ensure quality control. Fat chance in you-know-what apple would ever do that."
"This story reveals an underlying problem, DC charges are still too slow compared to gas stations. You can fill a gas car en less than 5 minutes, compare to Level 3 charges that still requires an hour. This causes a severe convenience problem for electric cars. if you are running out of gas and still need to use the car, you can quickly solve the problem at a gas station; with electric cars what if you still need the car? (You had a pretty busy day), you are no good for more than 6 hours while the car charges.<p>Certainly, it will be a good business opportunity for the company who figures out how to take charge time to gas station levels.<p>In Condominiums, metered charges could be installed in each appartment parking lot. For those who don&#x27;t have a garage or parking lots, small public charging stations could be used, although the charging time problem would need to be solved."

"I wonder if the new people will do anything about the &quot;site is actively hostile to photosensitive people&quot; thing.

I had &gt;40k posts, I met the kid we ended up adopting there, and so on.

"This is based on the metal injection molding materials already available. BASF manufactures them for MIM (Think die casting).  This process is very well understood and used to make many mass produced metal parts in products we use every day.  Using a 3d printer to form the green part is new, but the process and materials aren&#x27;t.<p>The main hurdle here is the quality of the processing from the green part to the final part.  BASF provides it as a service, you print the green part then ship it to them for processing in the same plant that does the processing for the metal injection molded parts.  This takes a couple weeks to get your part back.<p>I evaluated both the BASF and virtual foundry materials and processes for use in my product design consultancy and found that neither provided a significant benefit over other 3d metal printing options (sls, investment casting of a 3d print, etc).<p>I have full rolls of several of the virtual foundry materials as well as the BASF SS material if anyone is interested in experimenting more.<p>I really wanted these materials to be more useful than they have turned out to be in relation to product design."

"Got curious and decided to go through their SEO.<p>- First off, according to Ahrefs, their dofollow &#x2F; nofollow ratio is a staggering 10:1, which is a huge red flag right away. A more natural ratio would be in the neighborhood of 1:2 so we are talking 20x less. But hey, maybe it&#x27;s the niche that naturally attracts a ton of dofollow links - let&#x27;s move on<p>- Looking at another of the main spam indicators, anchor text, most of them are just single keywords, like &quot;ashwagandha&quot;, which point to the page optimized to rank for that exact generic search. The entire website is targeting single-term searches, which are notoriously hard to rank for and attract a lot of spam websites. This falls into anchor text over-optimization. They have 210 referring pages linking to their curcumin page with the exact anchor text &quot;curcumin&quot;, same with &quot;catechins&quot;, &quot;creatine&quot;, &quot;caffeine&quot;, &quot;vitamin d&quot; and the list goes on for all the keywords they are trying to rank for. This is not just unusual, it&#x27;s literally impossible for it to just happen naturally. This has the Penguin penalty written all over it. Moving on...<p>- Their backlinks are for sure interesting. Among their top backlinks, we have pages such as:
<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.herbalsupplementreview.com&#x2F;retro-lean-forskolin&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.herbalsupplementreview.com&#x2F;retro-lean-forskolin&#x2F;</a> - with a URL rating of 46 for a website with zero traffic. In SEO terms these are called “PBN links”. Not that unusual for the health niche, but definitely not white hat. Here’s another one with the same identical metrics as the previous one (this time, it’s a homepage link), also from a dubious website with zero traffic: 
<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;best-testosteronebooster.com&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;best-testosteronebooster.com&#x2F;</a>.<p>All of these with exact match anchor texts leading to their corresponding Examine.com pages.<p>- Mind you, I’m not saying that they don’t have great editorial content, and I’m not sure who helped them with their SEO, but I’m not the least bit surprised that Google might have penalized them multiple times for several reasons. There&#x27;s probably more stuff but this is what I was able to find with a quick analysis."

"Former astronomer here!  A lot of the comments here are about how this event occurred 26,000 years ago.  I thought it would be useful to describe how we think about these things in astronomy.<p>Firstly, yes it is true that this happened 26,000 years ago!  More specifically, the event happened 26,000 years ago in our reference frame.  There are other reference frames in which this event occurred two minutes ago or 5 million years ago.  But generally these are not useful reference frames since the Earth&#x27;s reference frame is not too different from the reference frame with respect to the center of mass of the Galaxy (we are not moving all that fast compared to the speed of light).<p>That said, as astronomers we are not particularly interested in dating precisely when the event happened.  26,000 years is a very long time in human history, but it&#x27;s not very long on astronomical timescales.  Not very much has changed in the Galaxy over the past 26,000 years, so we don&#x27;t gain much by dating it at the time the event occurred (with respect to the Earth&#x27;s reference frame, of course).  Furthermore, we wouldn&#x27;t even know exactly when it happened even if we wanted to!  Our clocks are very precise here on Earth, but our distance measurements to most celestial objects are very fuzzy, particularly the further away you get.  Because of this, these sorts of events are always referred to with respect to the year they were observed on Earth.  (Thus, the most recent nearby supernova is known as 1987A because it was the first supernova observed in 1987.)<p>This all changes when you are studying more distant objects though!  For very distant galaxies, we are now seeing things when the universe was considerably younger and things were much different.  Then it becomes important to keep the event&#x27;s age in mind.  For these objects we will actually refer to their <i>redshift</i>.  The redshift can be measured relatively well, and is related to the distance and age of the event via the Hubble constant and the acceleration parameter.  Measuring these parameters is tricky and is a whole subfield of their own, so we usually stick with redshift as it is more related to things we can easily measure.<p>A final note on the paper itself.  These observations were taken at Keck on Mauna Kea.  There has been a lot of controversy around the construction of the Thirty Meter Telescope, so the authors actually acknowledge indigenous Hawaiians specifically in their paper:<p>&gt; The authors wish to recognize that the summit of Maunakea has always held a very significant cultural role for the indigenous Hawaiian community.  We are most fortunate to have the opportunity to observe from this mountain."

"Excellent! They were the true Titans of the Tech. industry. How i wish &quot;modern&quot; tech companies followed this advice.<p>This passage in particular should be memorized by every &quot;Manager&quot;.<p><i>Over the years we have developed the policy that it is important for the supervisor to thoroughly know and understand the work of his group. A debate on this has been carried on by management people for years. Some say you can be a good manager without having the slightest idea of what you are trying to manage, that the techniques of management are all important. There are many organizations which work that way. I don&#x27;t argue that the job can&#x27;t be done that way but I do argue strongly that the best job can be done when the manager or supervisor has a real and genuine understanding of his group&#x27;s work. I don&#x27;t see how a person can even understand what proper standards are and what performance is required unless he does understand in some detail the very specific nature of the work he is trying to supervise. We have held closely to this philosophy and we intend to continue to do so. We expect you who are supervising to learn techniques of supervision and keep up to date. I want to emphasize you can supervise best when you know a great deal about the work you are supervising and when you know the techniques of supervision as well.</i>"

I just read that Elsevier made £2.54 billion in revenue last year. I didn’t know academic publishing was such a lucrative business.<p>By comparison Penguin Random House makes €3.3 billion euros in revenue last yr and they sell a ton of books. Simon and Schuster makes $800m&#x2F;yr.<p>I guess annuity’s from businesses and non profits using a legacy business model that predates technology beats selling books. No wonder they want to protect the business.

Judges are elected officials in the US, so the judge you get can be pretty arbitrary.  They are allowed to be callous, and impose very harsh sentences, with little or no oversight.  They can lie, and be backed entirely by the prosecution.<p>If I had a judge that imposed 9 years in prison, or 3 weeks of standing in a field wearing a funny hat, I would immediately take prison.  I dont know this judge and my appointed attorney for the state isnt exactly knocking it out of the park.  Prison comes with formal educational options like finishing a GED or starting college.  It has educated psychologists and psychiatrists to seriously help with some offenders major problems; its not just a clever guy in a robe.  Finally, prison has work placement assistance and reintegration assistance if needed.<p>My &quot;feel good&quot; punishment will still come with a criminal conviction.  The difference is I will have foregone any semblance of formal restitution in the eyes of my friends, family, or employers."

"A fact that many people miss about Ebola is that while its survival rate is very low when untreated, it becomes relatively high (I think in the 80%) with simple things like IV hydration. Basically you are going to lose a LOT of water through that infection. Feeding you water (and minerals) directly in the veins gives a surprisingly high survival rate.<p>What makes Ebola so dangerous is the ease at which infection spreads within the medical staff and how quick it can occupy all your beds and &quot;simple&quot; IV devices.<p>Depending on how it is made, a cure may not change much. If it relies on medical attention, then it probably won&#x27;t change the high death rate of people outside medical care, which is what allows an epidemic to start."
"Python&#x27;s success is richly deserved.

I occasionally also get sucked into the sorts of debates that I just shat on, but most of the time I find myself having to scroll past huge chunks of comment sections because half the sub-threads are pedantic political debates over some term or whatever, nested 10+ levels deep."
"Good advice? I don&#x27;t know. And that&#x27;s going to be the problem.<p>When I was a lead engineer at $oldCompany, I was responsible for an ad server, backed by GBs of blocking rules, that needed to run on a few variants of our owned and operated hardware. Some of the production machines had only 16GB of RAM, so we needed to be prudent about how we used memory.<p>The server was written in Java and loves to eat memory. But only 50% of the memory was given to Java. I recall having one spirited debate with a devops engineer about how much memory to assign Java. &quot;We can cache more data in we had a bigger heap!&quot; I said. &quot;The OS needs memory on its own!&quot; said the devops engineer. Looking back, I think you can looked at our debate in one of two ways:<p>1. Lead app developer genuinely asking for numbers and experiments to show why 50% is not just some arbitrary number
2. Lead app developer throwing his weight around and pushing for more memory against the advice of his colleague<p>We ended running an experiment to running a single production machine with 75% of memory allocated to Java. This system looked great at first, then about a week later, under very high traffic, started to have problems. We reverted the configuration and went back to the policy of leaving aside 50% of RAM &quot;for the OS&quot; and thing appeared to get better. I still don&#x27;t know why that setting &quot;seemed&quot; optimal.<p>I was wrong. But I couldn&#x27;t have learned that lesson easily. I wished I just listened to my coworker and didn&#x27;t waste all that time. But there was no easy way to show I would&#x27;ve been wrong. I can have a debate with the old me and the new me won&#x27;t be able to demonstrate why setting aside memory, seemingly unused, is better.<p>As engineers, we expect to operate on evidence and data. But for some engineering decisions, getting comprehensive data is simply not practical. Some decisions ultimately comes down to who wins a debate. You can run experiments like I did, but even that was expensive (and likely not reproducible). I&#x27;ve learned to accept that we are going to make bad decisions. The key is to make the best of it.<p>I hope if ever work with someone like Rachel, I can disagree with her in a respectful way. I hope I can acknowledge that while my decision could be wrong, her voice was genuinely considered."
"I sometimes suffer from bad and acute anxiety attacks: I carry xanax (with the md prescription so I can travel). It happens very rarely (few times per year) and only 1 max 2 pills is enough to kill it usually. Without pills it just keeps going and when it happens it is impossible to stop unless using alcohol but then it does not end soon; it can take a week or longer and the feeling drives you mad (if you do not know it, good for you; you would not wish it on your worst enemy). So I make sure I have 2-4 pills on me.<p>There is no underlying cause that they can find or use to ‘fix it’, although I have a specific moment when it started (20 years ago). It used to be far worse (every 2 weeks taking 2-3 days) than it is now.<p>I often notice someone behave a certain way (some kind of movements or suddenly being ill and having to stay home, especially when there is a stressor; it is usually that or a migraine, which also still has stigma (here?), like, just take an aspirin and get over it, by people who do not suffer from them (I do not anymore luckily)) or tell something specific that makes me wonder if they suffer from anxiety; when I talk with them it often is the case. That way I found out that many of my friends and acquaintances suffer from it even though they never told anyone or were not even sure what it was.<p>A few months ago I was driving with someone from my village who I told someone next to me in the plane was vomiting all the trip; she said that maybe he has that weird feeling losing control she sometimes has which leads her to stay at home and grab a bottle. I told her to go to the doctor and ask about anxiety; they sent her to the mental health dep after some tests and gave her xanax and diazepam; she now is much happier as she can stop the attacks before they become full blown. She never knew that it was anxiety and she was afraid people (including the doctor, who usually is a guy who does not really believe in this stuff; he tried to give me soothing tea before I got a signed and translated doc from my Dutch ex doctor saying what I have) would find her a whining weak person.<p>Of all people I know who suffer or suffered from it, including my wife and family members, noone got properly diagnosed because it seems there is a big stigma resting on this. Mostly people think they can just ‘man up’ and tell themselves it will be fine. That is often not how it works; once it really starts you just cannot stop it; no amount of meditation or positive thought or exercise helps. So you try to mask it (for yourself and others) in several ways.<p>If you have anything; just go see a doctor; if it is anxiety, your life will improve massively if you get proper help.<p>Edit: I don’t recognise the anger bit, but yes, without pills, drinking is the only thing that helps&#x2F;calms down and it often makes it worse besides being unhealthy (especially as this can happen any hour, day or night, and downing a few beers at 6am is not quite, well... good, so definitely get pills and keep them on you; no drink needed ever again)."

"The particular issue of locking up a system because there are too many tabs open in Firefox or Chrome should be fixed in the browser, because the browser is the program that is taking up all of the memory and is in the best position to know how to recover a lot of memory quickly while minimizing the loss of work for the user.  One of the comments suggested having the kernel send a &#x27;memory pressure&#x27; signal to all processes, and a process could catch the signal and do garbage collection or drop other storage.  But even without such a feature, a program could do polling to determine that there is memory pressure, or do a check when a user asks to open a new tab, etc."

"I founded and run a DevOps consultancy (Elasticbyte.net) and fundamentally the biggest difference between daily DevOps work and typical software engineering is tooling. DevOps is all about the tooling, knowing which ones to use, and organizing and memorizing lots of details.<p>The majority of my time is either wrangling AWS, GCP or in tools such as Packer, Terraform, Ansible, Docker, Kubernetes, and writing bash scripts. I prefer DevOps now to writing traditional code as it is less down in the trenches nitty gritty code&#x2F;math&#x2F;logic and more higher level architecture and applying changes. I think it lends itself toward a slightly different personality type than a software developer."

"I think infrastructure in some places in the U.S. ends up looking a bit like a ponzi scheme.<p>Example city--Charlotte, NC. Down south in Charlotte there is an area called Ballantyne. Ballantyne has good schools, new everything, etc.<p>Ballantyne also has high taxes.<p>So what do people do?<p>Move 5-10 minutes down the road into South Carolina where there is abundant land. They start developing. More people move in. Schools are built. They fill up. They build new ones. People complain about the old two lane country roads so they are expanded.<p>Taxes go up to support this.<p>Then either people keep playing the move game to a new undeveloped area or the ROI calculation that nobody does on infrastructure catches up with the town. Some can support it, others can&#x27;t and it&#x27;s a downward spiral.<p>I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ve explained this well. I mostly think about this from the human POV, which I didn&#x27;t even mention above. The rational thing for someone living in the high tax area is to go to the new area as it is developing and everything is new and then to decamp before things go so far downhill that property values drop.<p>Game theory?

"It is interesting that its possible to produce chips at this price for more than a short time period. Also that they are all basically PIC clones or variants speaks to the core competency of these companies is manufacturing and operational efficiency, not MCU design.<p>I think a fascinating experiment here would be to invest some time in an unencumbered scalable design that could be implemented very inexpensively (say less than 10K gates). Would these manufacturers pick up that design and run with it, making variants and parts that people could buy? It would get Microchip off their back (several have been sued apparently)."
"Based Outlays of U.S. Corporations, we can see their at an all time high.  But, the chart, as far as i know is not inflation adjusted, so it&#x27;s likely not as steep as indicated.<p>honest question: does anyone have a reading on how sustainable this practice is?  Surely, there must be some calculation you can do.  Take the aggregate amount of capital (cash holdings) of all the companies and graph it, along with their ability to borrow more funds.  If that graph is going super down and the cash outlay is going super up, then surely it means we&#x27;re heading for a crash, right?"
"Inferential statistics is about explaining an observed outcome in terms of its causing factors.  Once we have explained it, then we can make predictions.  Machine learning skips the explaining part and goes straight to making predictions, without attempting to understand the underlying process that led to the particular outcome.  This would be the main difference, in my opinion."

"We&#x27;ve had an EV for about 6 months now -- no way to charge at home.  I will admit to being a special case, in that I have no problems at all charging the car, but the experience has led to some insights.<p>First, why I&#x27;m a special case.  I live in Japan.  Compared to Canada (and I assume most of the US), the charger situation here is <i>amazing</i>.  We&#x27;ve done a fair few road trips now and it seems like no matter where we go, there is a fast charger within 2-5 km.  At least 25% of the rest stops on the highway have them.  A large percentage of &quot;michi no eki&quot; (Road station -- essentially farmers markets) have them -- to the point where the other day we were on a road trip and were very surprised to see a michi no eki that <i>didn&#x27;t</i> didn&#x27;t have one.  Family Mart convenience store often has one (something like 1 in 10, I would guess).  Aeon (big shopping mall) has one or two (and often 15-20 200V chargers) and every Nissan and Mitsubishi dealership has one.<p>This is really the future, I think.  It costs <i>millions</i> to make a gas station.  It costs <i>thousands</i> to put in a fast charger.  You can put one <i>anywhere</i> because we already have the electrical infrastructure in place.  I know several restaurants that have put them in.<p>At the moment, there is <i>way</i> more infrastructure than demand, so I very rarely have to wait.  If, for some reason I do, then I drive 2km the road and charge there.  It&#x27;s hard to know if this will get better or worse as things scale up, but for the moment it&#x27;s pretty good.<p>I&#x27;m also in a good situation in that I work from home.  When I want to charge the car (a couple of times a week), I drive to the Family Mart, plug in, pick up a few groceries and then work for 30 minutes to an hour.  They have a table (with power, even) for people to work at.  It&#x27;s air conditioned.  It&#x27;s so convenient, it&#x27;s crazy.<p>However, it&#x27;s the same thing when we travel.  Our car only has a 30 kWh range, so we have to stop relatively frequently.  But since there are chargers <i>all over the place</i>, we just stop and walk around.  We often end up buying small things, or having a snack.  We&#x27;ve seen so many amazing things since we got the EV because we&#x27;re forced to stop and hang out in the small towns.<p>I think people are going to cash in on this.  You are going to see small towns with parking lots with validated charging.  People are going to drive by, stop, pick up a few things and carry on.  Already the rest stops in Japan are absolutely geared for this: the have souvenir stores, restaurants and even things like clothing stores.<p>I think this is going to be a thing because compared to a gas station, it&#x27;s cheap <i>and it&#x27;s also really nice</i>.  I thought I would dread charging the car.  It&#x27;s actually one of the best parts of my week.  I get out and meet people.  I slow down a bit.  I get some shopping done.<p>Canada is kind of a difficult problem because it has 25x the land area and 1&#x2F;4 the population of Japan.  It&#x27;s going to be tough.  Also, they don&#x27;t have any particular reason for someone to invest money in the infrastructure.  Nissan and Mitsubishi are doubtlessly scared stiff of the time when Toyota and Honda enter the market.  They want to own that charging infrastructure -- so they are going crazy right now.  But I think it&#x27;s actually inevitable, so if you have a fair amount of capital and are looking for a long term investment, I think this is a good one."

"During my master&#x27;s we had assigned desks and mandatory presence 4.9 days a week. Desks would switch about four times a year using a verifiably random scheme, and in addition, there would be projects that we would work on with random people, so we switched desks a lot. Each desk comes with a proper 2-screen desktop setup, so pulling out your laptop was inferior. Via PXE boot, people would regularly reinstall their system for various reasons, so it would regularly be a fresh Ubuntu install. An additional requirement was that others must still be able to work on my system without (m)any quirks.<p>Only a few of us used any sort of automation. Most that did chose Ansible, and all I ever heard from them was cursing on new systems and, between homework, constantly tweaking the deployment script. I&#x27;m sure the comments will say Ansible works reliably and painlessly for them, but from what I&#x27;ve seen, it seems to take some time to get into it if you want to setup GUI systems in detail.<p>What worked extremely well for me was a shell script that I grabbed from my server (wget example.com&#x2F;setup.sh), ran, switched user account, ran step 2 (since it mounts the user&#x27;s homedir, you don&#x27;t want to do that while logged in), and then logged back into my real account. After less than 5 minutes of manual work, I had my desired software, the right desktop environment, task bar &#x2F; alt tab &#x2F; system tray &#x2F; clock &#x2F; etc. settings, and I mounted my homedir on a local server, which was fast enough to painlessly run virtual machines with GUI OSes off of it. I would be as productive and comfortable as on my private laptop after a few minutes of work in the worst case. The script took a few hours to create at first, and with a new Ubuntu release maybe another hour to make it work on the mix of old and new systems. The advantage over other people&#x27;s setups was that anyone could wipe my system without a second thought (usually you&#x27;d have to ask the desk&#x27;s owner, they&#x27;d want to copy files...) and others couldn&#x27;t snoop through my files (at least, not opportunistically: they&#x27;d have to purposefully install a keylogger rather than just &quot;sudo; ls &#x2F;home&#x2F;lucb1e&quot;) so I can jot down thoughts or save passwords in Thunderbird without worrying.<p>In a more common scenario (not shared systems that are regularly wiped), you&#x27;d leave out the mounting of the homedir and copy essential files instead, such as your bashrc&#x2F;vimrc. Using a simple shell script is something I still recommend to manage setting up personal systems. It&#x27;s what you would do anyway, except stored in a file instead of typing the commands manually. So that&#x27;s what I still use today, though I don&#x27;t switch systems often enough to warrant maintaining commands for GUI configuration preferences (which can be a pain to figure out how to set from the command line). My current setup script is included in my bashrc (which I copy together with a .vimrc) and mainly pulls packages. I specify which categories I want, e.g. if the system has WiFi it&#x27;ll install wavemon, or if the system has a GUI it&#x27;ll install wireshark and xdotool."

They are talking about a PIN code to unlock the phone to access the data on the phone. Could they not just remove the memory chip and access it directly? Even if the data on it is encrypted using a 6-digit PIN, brute-forcing that should be a trivial task."
"That&#x27;s a bit curious though. If the code relies on a magic value, you&#x27;d think it&#x27;s in order to skip trying to get data it doesn&#x27;t have, like the address of the unidentifiable cars.<p>Even if NULL then does have this address attached, why does it take the branch where it looks for the data?<p>I suppose it would be in a relational DB, perhaps there&#x27;s a join that drops missing entries, but if they aren&#x27;t missing they show up?"

"My $0.02: I came across Boeing&#x27;s documentation for their &quot;Boeing Update&quot; solution. (think Windows Update, but for 787s).<p>It described in detail how the planes are updated with new firmware for the avionics, entertainment system, and the engines. I was shocked to learn that the 787 uses a lot of COTS kit internally, such as standard WiFi and Ethernet connections. There&#x27;s an RJ-45 jack at the front landing gear accessible from the outside of the plane at any time!<p>It was by far the best technical document I have ever read, of any type, ever by at least a factor of ten. It was so good I read it like a novel. Twice. The security design was amazing. The PKI was amazing. The patch management was amazing. The network design was amazing. The documentation was amazing. My estimate was the the document <i>alone</i> would have cost multiple millions of dollars to write, not including any of the engineering work that went into the solution itself.<p>Boeing&#x27;s engineers thought of <i>everything</i>. EVERYTHING. This scenario was catered for:<p><pre><code>  - The plane is rented, not owned.
  - The IT department is outsourced.
  - Aircraft maintenance is outsourced.
  - The plane is currently on the ground in a country that is hostile.
  - A critical update has been released, without which the plane is unsafe to fly.
</code></pre>
This is one of the scenarios that is literally spelled out, in plain English, and you&#x27;re left completely certain that the update will be safe and secure despite all of that.<p>The security is just nuts. Everything uses explicit, hardcoded whitelists. TLS is bidirectional (clients are verified by the servers too). Patches must be <i>quadruple</i> signed by Boing, the parts manufacturer, the FAA, and the airline at a <i>minimum</i> to be acceptable. There are physical connection breakers and PIN codes on top of that. There are two <i>nested</i> VPNs on top of the already encrypted WiFi. It just goes on and on.<p>No part of it left me thinking they could have done better. I&#x27;ve used that document as a template for my own work, and it&#x27;s the better for it.<p>Since then, I&#x27;ve insisted on flying 787s whenever possible, because I&#x27;m certain that the engineering effort that has gone into those things is about as good as humanly possible."

"&gt; The good news? With so much stolen information in circulation, there’s almost certainly an oversupply of raw materials for fraud and an undersupply of willing criminals.<p>This is what I&#x27;ve always used as cold comfort. Given the degree of anarchy on the side of the actual data, and given that society hasn&#x27;t totally collapsed yet, it must be that deterrence by companies and prosecutors is good enough on its own to keep fraud from happening everywhere it could. Even though chances are high that your information is out there, chances remain relatively low that you&#x27;ll actually be targeted. Of course you still want to keep yourself out of that minority by freezing your credit, etc., but it&#x27;s something."

"While there&#x27;s definitely backlash happening against companies like Google and Facebook, I have another theory.<p>New graduates are less interested in these companies because they don&#x27;t represent their generation.  When I was a kid, the idea of working for these companies was cool not only because they had cool products but because they were relatively <i>new</i> and were something relevant to be a part of.<p>Today, these companies aren&#x27;t so cool to graduates because they&#x27;re old school in tech years.  Facebook and Google are <i>massive</i> companies where your impact will probably be a drop in the ocean.  In a lot of ways, they&#x27;re the IBM and Xerox of today; why would a kid in the 70s or the 80s want to work for those stuffy and slow-moving corporations when they could work for Apple or Microsoft?  Maybe millennial still view these companies the way they did in their youth, but I doubt that Gen Z see them as the exciting new thing.  Young people naturally want to do something new and don&#x27;t want to exist merely to be the Atlas of the same world their elders built."

"I would focus on making the best Reddit macOS app you can, that will likely be your largest and most receptive audience. You should use the Apollo iOS app as your benchmark as far as responsiveness and feature set is concerned.<p>I signed up for the beta, the most glaring omissions are:<p>1. Keyboard shortcuts.

In the same vertical space that I can see 14 posts on reddit.com, I can only see 10 in the compact view in your app. The comments are in worse shape, you must remove the spacing between the comment &quot;cards&quot;.<p>Overall, I&#x27;m impressed with what you&#x27;ve built here and could see using this app. Keyboard shortcuts are a must before I would spend any significant time using it."

"I find a lot of these to be really contrived and not actually exploits.<p>For example, the first &quot;issue&quot; for yum[0] shows that you can create a RPM that will run arbitrary commands when installed, and then shows the example install command, which requires root access.

"I see these problems from a different angle than the usual commentators.  I continue to ask myself: Why is mobile used for important things, e.g., banking, payments, etc.?<p>A great example is authenticating a person&#x27;s identity via possession of a SIM card, i.e., their mobile number.  If one can switch SIM cards, then one can switch identities.  This flexibility is not a flaw in mobile communications; the ease-of-use is what makes mobile so useful.  However it is silly to pretend mobile is as safe as landline for all uses.   Mobile may be altogether more useful than landline -- few could argue otherwise -- and at the same time it can be entirely inappropriate for use in important things like banking.  This concept seems non-existant.  Instead the prevailing thinking is all-or-nothing.<p>In addition to &quot;convenience&quot;, mobile has introduced a new class of problems when used for important things like banking and payments.  These problems either do not exist or exist at a much lower scale with respect to landline.  Who owns landline service?  Crooks?<p>From where I stand, the risks of using mobile for important transactions outweigh the benefits.  Unfortunately, I also see that &quot;convenience&quot; continues to prevail over common sense.  I am willing to sacrafice convenience for peace of mind.  Meanwhile banks and others push harder and harder for customers to use mobile, including as a means of verifying identity."

"Say what you want about Google&#x2F;Alphabet as a whole, but Google Flights is incredible. It&#x27;s absolutely amazing how quickly and largely that Google crushed all its competitors in terms of usability. Kayak, Hipmunk, Orbitz, Skyscanner were all my go-to&#x27;s at one point but G.Flights is far superior in so many ways. It actually remembers your airline preference between searches. You don&#x27;t have to beg or change settings to see a few days before or after... every search has a date grid and long-term graph, both which respond almost immediately to additional changes to date ranges. Searching multiple airports or destinations is super easy. Plus the calendar view, with lowest price for every day -- sure other sites have it but only for unfiltered searches. Google&#x27;s calendar view is updated with every filter change.<p>There was a time in the 90s when eAAsySabre was publicly available to anyone, and text based searches were simple and fast and so easy. But Google Flights is even better, IMO.<p>Pretty amazing that sites entirely dependent on travel search seem satisfied with 10-year old UI while Google showed how much better it could be."

"When I first heard of this trend of buybacks I got annoyed. But then I realized, isn’t this just a “Miller and Modigliani” switch from equity to debt financing?<p>The shareholders get cash and can reinvest it in other ventures, including buying the debt of said company.<p>(I like this! Focus on what you do, and if there’s isn’t anything left for you to grow into, let me figure something for myself. This is personal for me - my dad lost a lot of his retirement on GE stock because Jack Welsh decided to turn GE into a bank instead of an eng. company.)<p>Meanwhile the company doing buybacks hasn’t really changed (it’s book value is the same - see M&amp;M [0]) except now it’s taxed far less.<p>The biggest problem with this is that the leeches at the top get bonuses for meaninglessly changing the stock price. Since their comp packages can go into the hundreds of millions (again, Welsh), this sucks!<p>We could argue that debt financing is unstable, and I wouldn’t disagree. But unless we’re talking stability, what’s the problem with buybacks?<p>[0] as an example, to compare Ford (4b shares @ $10) and Tesla (173m shares @250), you can’t just multiply their stock price by the outstanding shares (both about $40billion) . You must also add their debt load (ford co $150 billion, TSLA $14 billion). Ford Co is (for now) a much more valuable company than TSLA. After all it delivers millions of cars every year!<p>Debt was used to finance Ford factories, just as stocks would have."

"This is very interesting to me. It also makes me think about the natural rise of monopolies and monoculture in tech. GitHub has really been extending to &quot;eating the world&quot; as of late. Recently in terms of their package registry that must have folks like Artifactory and Nexus a bit shaken, and now this, which is bad news for folks like CircleCI (and I say this as a CircleCI user).<p>As a developer, in the short term I love this. Fewer things I need to cobble together and worry about how to integrate. I mean, it&#x27;s already the case that if GitHub goes down that my CircleCI jobs won&#x27;t work, so having one company to yell at and monitor alone is a plus.<p>But long term it makes the competitive ecosystem much less robust. And as a startup employee, makes me feel how disrupting established platform competitors gets that much more difficult - even if you have a better product, it&#x27;s hard to fight against the &quot;platform&quot; as they have more integrated points of value."

"And that&#x27;s a sad thing to hear. Before my death by thousand downvotes, I&#x27;d like to tell you why do I feel that way.<p>Back in the day when I was way more inexperienced than I&#x27;m now, I was a die-hard Python fanboy. To me, it seemed like a best option available due to it being way more concise and readable than JS&#x2F;PHP, not to mention that it was way more powerful and dense. I didn&#x27;t really bother with type safety at the time and I wasn&#x27;t exposed to any real criticism of it at the time, as it happens often when you&#x27;re just too new, and I was more than fine with it.<p>Time mercilessly marched forward since then. I worked with different codebases, changing tech stacks and languages a bit, learning new stuff and so on. With some experience, lots of self-education and a vast amount of different workflows to compare with, I&#x27;ve realized one important thing. While Python may be better than some languages that are considered trash by industry consensus, it&#x27;s also a trashcan language to ones with sound and flexible type systems, not to mention that, across dynamically typed contenders, it&#x27;s nowhere near as powerful as literally any solid Lisp.<p>That said, I feel bad for the industry that &quot;dives into Python&quot; more and more over the last years. While it may seem like a pretty easy and cool-ish language to write in, you will inevitably have large problems at scale, it just doesn&#x27;t have what it takes to be easily scalable, and most importantly, it&#x27;s just tedious to refactor when it&#x27;s big, even though the language itself is mind-numbingly easy and even your grandma can jump right in.<p>In a conclusion I&#x27;d like to say that you&#x27;ll be better off without using Python as your project&#x27;s main driver. Yes, it&#x27;s simple to write it and the developers supply is abundant. It&#x27;s easy to start. It&#x27;ll just be a major pain to scale it and support it later on.<p>Edit: Made a pun."

That dude from Gilt has a &quot;Test Into Prod&quot; thesis that seems to square the circle. (I can&#x27;t say from personal experience, but someday hope to work somewhere willing to try it.)"
"I went to one here in Boulder, and that was enough for me. Couldn&#x27;t really control my suspension of belief (like say, a good movie with a silly, but engaging plot) to get into to it, and each puzzle just felt like work. You kinda hope for say, Myst, but in real life, but felt more like a weekly Martin Gardnir, but just scattered about a room, and I had to pay $35 to solve it. My mind literally went to chores I&#x27;d rather be doing instead being where I was. All the props just felt like someone went to a thrift store. I should&#x27;ve drank considerably more before participating - the same feeling you get at like, a funeral for someone you dont really know."

This seems a pretty good introduction to monads.<p>There is a cliche that no-one can write a good introduction to monads. I don&#x27;t think that is true. My opinion is more that monads were so far from the average programmer&#x27;s experience they could not grok them. I think as more people experience particular instances of monads (mostly Futures &#x2F; Promises) the mystique will wear off and eventually they will be a widely known part of the programmer&#x27;s toolkit. I&#x27;ve seen this happen already with other language constructs such as first-class functions. (&quot;The future is here just not evenly distributed.&quot;)

"Back when iTunes was new, a potato chip company in NZ had a promotion where each packet of chips had a printed code that got you enough iTunes credit to buy one song. By itself it was a good deal - buy a packet of chips for $1.50 (or whatever) and get a song worth 99 cents for free.<p>What made it amazing was I found that the codes were also printed in the smaller kids-lunch-sized packets that the local discount supermarket was selling in packs of 8 for $6.<p>Not the most spectacular discount but I still felt I was sticking it to the man each time I ate a tiny packet of chips while listening to a new song."

"In the mid-1990s I hitched across the UK.<p>Not once, but constantly for 2.5 years.<p>I was homeless, rough sleeping, and instead of choosing hostels I chose to travel the UK - this was a survival tactic, hostels were not nice or safe places. I would hitch from one city to another, and my sign would simply say &quot;North&quot; or &quot;South&quot;.<p>I had the greatest chance of being picked up at the slip road exiting a service station. So sometimes if I woke in a city I would walk 10-15 miles to get to the first service station on a motorway out of town. This is easy around London or in the midlands, but really hard in the South West.<p>The people I met... oh wow. It was almost exclusively solo male drivers who picked people up. They were doing long road journeys and wanted company and to stay awake and engaged. To not fall asleep at the wheel.<p>Your role as a hitcher... to be a graceful, clean, respectful passenger and to bring conversation and to know when to be quiet.<p>The people though. I once was picked up by one of the Birmingham Six <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Birmingham_Six"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Birmingham_Six</a> , on another occasion by a man who was dying and using his remaining months talking to people by picking them up hitching. There were saviours who would go out of their way in deep winter to get me somewhere safe. There were others who were themselves a danger and the propositions I received were... out there. I only once felt the need to do a runner at the first opportunity.<p>Mostly though, people were incredibly kind, considerate, cool.<p>And universally, everyone that picked me up said that the reason they did so was that they had once hitched and felt a need to continue to offer that kindness now that they had the means to pick someone up and give them a lift."
"I saw this in my Twitter feed a few days ago. Some hilarious comment included &quot;Return of the yummy&quot;.<p>I&#x27;ve actually been experimenting with sourdough recently. It&#x27;s very easy to get started with this and even the failures are pretty tasty. All you need is clean water, some decent flour and about 7-10 days to turn that into a stable sourdough starter. After that, you can just keep on growing it and baking bread, pizza, pancakes (oh yes), etc. Dangerously delicious. I could use less carbs in my life, though."

"Nice, wouldn&#x27;t mind trying something like that myself.  I&#x27;m not sure if we get enough sun though ;)<p>I put a PiZeroW in our garden as a wildlife camera in an IP68 case with a waterproof USB connector for power, but alas sometimes it possibly overheats or becomes unresponsive and requires switching it off&#x2F;on again.  (It hit around 90C once, I have since added a little heat sink, but not sure how much that helps in a closed case).<p>I also found I had to slightly overvolt the PiZero in the config to get the camera to function correctly.<p>I&#x27;ve been trying to see if there&#x27;s any interesting serial output when it becomes unresponsive by adding an ESP32 to it.  But I haven&#x27;t quite got the hang of programming that yet."

When reading these kind of articles it always strikes me as odd that we had such a huge problem to stabilize systems running on as little as a few MHz and now we have GHz machines that are relatively solid performers. The first time I built a system with a base clock above 16MHz it took all kinds of rituals to keep the system running good enough to get some use out of it.

"Back in the 1970s I hitched across the US about 3 times,
over various routes, and all of Heren’s story rings true
to me, especially the huge variety of drivers willing to
offer rides.  About a third to a half of the people who
picked me up remarked, in almost the same words, 
“I used to hitch when I was younger, but it feels
too dangerous now” [&lt;1980].  It was troubling to find,
more recently, that my youthful sense of immortality
had faded, leaving me saying the same words to 
younger people."
"Maybe it&#x27;s right for the data analysis world, since jupyter, pandas, matplotlib and anaconda form a better stack than R.. however for the web development, if you don&#x27;t go with rails you will start to ask yourself: why python is better than Go, Node.JS, etc&quot; ?"
"Not to jump slightly off topic, but it boggles my mind how this topic (i.e., toxins) has not been included in the (cost of) healthcare &quot;debate&quot; in the USA. How did health of the individual - which is a function of lifestyle and environment - become completely disconnected from the cost of trying to maintain that individual as a productive member of society?<p>Obesity gets a free pass. Sedentary gets a free pass. Toxins in the environment gets a free pass. Etc. What are (my fellow) Americans reading, watching, and talking about if these things this simple are completely foreign to them?"

"This is a review of the documentary covering a &#x27;Town Bully&#x27; who had evaded authorities and continued to harm people repeatedly. In order to protect the community, a group of vigilantes murdered them, and the community refused to issue any statements to authorities regarding anyone&#x27;s involvement.<p>I think broadly, I wonder what the place of vigilanteism like this should serve. The sentiments to protect the community against a man who isn&#x27;t being recieved adequate justice- this in my opinion seems to echo the justification of other movements I&#x27;m aware of. There&#x27;s often community discouse online on what to do with known bad actors when moderatorship isn&#x27;t adequate for example."

"I think the programming pattern paradigm is the right way to explain monads (as you can tell from my own monad explanation: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kybernetikos.com&#x2F;2012&#x2F;07&#x2F;10&#x2F;design-pattern-wrapper-with-composable-actions&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kybernetikos.com&#x2F;2012&#x2F;07&#x2F;10&#x2F;design-pattern-wrapper-w...</a>) The category theory language around it is off-putting to working programmers, and many of the ways people explain it is by trying to introduce yet more terminology rather than just working with the perfectly adequate terminology that working programmers already have.<p>I think part of it is that lots of languages don&#x27;t have sufficient abstraction ability to encapsulate the monad pattern in their type system, and those that do tend to be academic focused. That doesn&#x27;t mean you can&#x27;t (and do) use monads in the other languages, it&#x27;s just that you can&#x27;t describe the whole pattern in their type systems.<p>I was pretty sad that the discussion around javascript promises sidelined the monad pattern."
"This i made on my website in 1999. In my case it was an online poll, but the principle was the same.<p>When people attempted to vote multiple times, the count would only increase locally in the spammers browser. Only the first vote was saved in the database. The spamming votes we stored in a cookie on client and added them to the results before rendering the result so he believed he submitted multiple votes.<p>We had some server side logging as well. Was funny to see in the logs, the number of people that tried to submit multiple votes and to see a few user submitting a lot before realizing the votes didn&#x27;t get added to the db.<p>Was very effective and reduced the worst of the spamming significantly."
To me the worst is that there seems no way to clean this up. Like the story when he applies for a mortgage and they tell him not to bother. At least at this point you would expect somebody to take a look and clean this up. But instead the machine keeps going.
"The Hoover story (decline chapter) goes beyond the legendary sales promotion.<p>The former factory in Perivale, West London was an Art Deco masterpiece, that closed down in 1982. There was manufacturing in South Wales (the &#x27;China&#x27; of it&#x27;s day) and that factory finally closed about a decade ago. This factory also did the contract manufacturing for the Sinclair C5.<p>The actual promotion was not that wild a deal. If you look at the privatisations that the UK public were offered you can see some true gift-horses. If you bought shares in anything the government were flogging off then you made a lot of money. You also were bought - you could be expected to vote Conservative from then on - &#x27;brand loyal&#x27;.<p>If we look at the VC funded things that go on today, every early Uber ride was a &#x27;sales promotion&#x27;. Same with the early days of Amazon where money was not so important. Even online groceries sales are a bit speculative.<p>What is sad is the lack of genuine offers from today&#x27;s brands. In the olden days competitions would have a &#x27;tie breaker&#x27; to complete, nowadays they want you to text or call a premium rate number that costs enough to pay for the promotion.<p>In the 1980&#x27;s a typical &#x27;really good promotion&#x27; could be something like the Weetabix Lego offer. If you bought a dozen packs of Weetabix cereal then you would have enough tokens to get a really good and quite exclusive Lego set, or, if you didn&#x27;t want to have 576 Weetabix biscuits to eat then you could pay retail equivalent for the Lego offer. There was nothing disingenuous about it and any delay in shipping (28 days of delivery was never realistic) only added to the excitement and anticipation.<p>I don&#x27;t know why but in the days before the internet when everything had to be manually transcribed from posted-in forms the offers and promotions were just that bit more honest. Stuff wasn&#x27;t cheap and made in China then. The Hoover disaster marks the end of this happy chapter of consumerism."
"Dirac was a legend and a man who actually believed in the principle that the universe itself was a mathematical structure, rather than making mathematics the tool which we use to describe the universe. His amazing prediction of anti-matter from a pure theoretical &#x2F; mathematical basis was astounding. He also believed in the principle of mathematical beauty and that one should use this principle in attempting to find the laws of the universe, and I very much agree.<p><i>In the James Scott Prize Lecture that he gave on 6 February 1939, Dirac spelled out his new ideas of the relationship between mathematics and physics which focused on the concept of mathematical beauty. Many years before his brother in law Eugene Wigner famously problematized the unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics in the natural sciences, Dirac discussed the same topic. How is it that the mathematical-deductive method is so remarkably successful in physics? According to Dirac:</i><p><i>“This must be ascribed to some mathematical quality in Nature, a quality which the casual observer of Nature would not suspect, but which nevertheless plays an important role in Nature’s scheme. One might describe the mathematical quality in Nature by saying that the universe is so constituted that mathematics is a useful tool in its description. However, recent advances in physical science show that this statement of the case is too trivial. The connection between mathematics and the description of the universe goes far deeper than this.”</i><p><i>In his James Scott Lecture and at numerous later occasions, Dirac asserted that the modern history of theoretical physics provides convincing evidence that there is a perfect marriage between the rules that mathematicians find interesting by their own standards and the rules that govern natural phenomena. He thought this was not accidental, but that it might reflect some deep identity between mathematics and physics:</i><p><i>“Pure mathematics and physics are becoming ever more closely connected, though their methods remain different. One may describe the situation by saying that the mathematician plays a game in which he himself invents the rules while the physicist plays a game in which the rules are provided by Nature, but as time goes on it becomes increasingly evident that the rules which the mathematician finds interesting are the same as those which Nature has chosen. It is difficult to predict what the result of all this will be. Possibly, the two subjects will ultimately unify, every branch of pure mathematics then having its physical application, its importance in physics being proportional to its interest in mathematics.”</i><p><i>Dirac suggested that future developments in theoretical physics would lead to the “existence of a scheme in which the whole of the description of the universe has its mathematical counterpart.” In accordance with this philosophy, he advised physicists to “begin by choosing that branch of mathematics which one thinks will form the basis of the new theory. One should be influenced very much in this choice by considerations of mathematical beauty. . . . Having decided on the branch of mathematics, one should proceed to develop it along suitable lines, at the same time looking for that way in which it appears to lend itself naturally to physical interpretation.”</i><p>Source:<p><a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blogs.unimelb.edu.au&#x2F;sciencecommunication&#x2F;2017&#x2F;09&#x2F;24&#x2F;on-mathematical-beauty-in-physics&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blogs.unimelb.edu.au&#x2F;sciencecommunication&#x2F;2017&#x2F;09&#x2F;24...</a><p>He was an outstanding man with outstanding insights on the nature of matter and the universe."

"Its complicated because people make it complicated.  Instead of following trend bullshit and self-justifying tooling insanity start with the a solid foundation and build on it one tiny layer at a time.<p>This is a learning process.  It isn&#x27;t something a tool can magically do for you.  If you think you can nail this in two hours or by dicking around with some tool you are lying to yourself.  Don&#x27;t worry, everybody with half a brain will see you for exactly what you are, so be honest with yourself that you probably aren&#x27;t some software rockstar and learn to take the primitive dumb stuff very seriously.<p>If you are hoping a tool will magically do it for you then you will continue to suck.  The web will continue to be a complicated mystery.  You will probably continue to cry about how hard life is and people won&#x27;t want to be around you.<p>At the most primitive the web is HTTP and HTML.  Don&#x27;t over think this.  If you understand those you have the web.  You don&#x27;t even need URI.  URI is an added convenience.<p>Next, build less shitty HTML.  Any HTML no matter how ugly, inaccessible, presentation-oriented, user-agent centered, and otherwise broken is still a good start so long as it displays content to a web browser.  The first goal of HTML is something that just works... somewhat.  Improve on this.  Learn to write better HTML and better content.  Most people don&#x27;t take HTML seriously, but this is really the most important part of building a good web experience.<p>Third, learn some presentation using CSS.  This will take some practice.  This takes some real practice.  It isn&#x27;t hard, and you can do really almost anything with CSS.  Even still people FEAR the CSS.<p>Fourth, be a damn programmer and stop being afraid to read code.  Learn to write JavaScript.  Learn the concept of scope.  Learn to really read code.  A bunch of tooling and test automation isn&#x27;t going to read the code for you, though many developers seem to think that is exactly what layers of unnecessary tools are for.  Keep this very simple at first.  Learn some basic events and then bail out.  Don&#x27;t immediately think you are some kind of architectural wizard, because you will fail.  If you think a framework will solve this for you then continue to be mystified and confused.<p>Fifth, learn the DOM.  The DOM is the heartbeat, or assembly language, of the client-side application experience of the web.  The DOM is what binds HTML to the browser and CSS&#x2F;JavaScript to HTML.  Without the DOM you have a plain text experience with really bad presentation that you shouldn&#x27;t be using.  Frameworks won&#x27;t teach you this.  The best way to learn the DOM, how it really works, is to learn XML Schema.  I strongly suggest this even if you never use XML or schemas ever again.<p>Build on that.  Baby steps.  It takes some effort but it isn&#x27;t complicated."

"Hi folks,<p>I recently left Google (8 years, 4 months, 4 days :)) and co-founded a deep learning startup. We’re building a large scale model to learn human behavior and detect, predict, and explain suspicion and fraud. Our focus is on insurance involving human beings, accidents and their health - such as disability, workers’ compensation and other areas.<p>“Insurance” may sound like a boring problem domain, but it’s far from that. On the ethical side, it’s a huge problem, with estimated $40B-$80B paid out to fraud annually, with very little recourse to the fraudsters. And we’re all paying for it. The detection process today is almost entirely manual&#x2F;human intuition based, not data driven. Our mission is to put a stop to this loop hole by leveraging large historical data sets and deep learning and introducing a modern, systematic real-time detection approach. We put it in the hands of professional detectives. We provide realtime monitoring, alerts, explanations and supporting evidence.<p>The data set is a time series of events starting with an accident + injury, followed up by many diagnosis, interviews, witness statements, medical reports; treatments, with some final outcome. The outcome can be a full recovery, partial disability or a permanent disability.<p>This time series is represented by a large structured as well as large unstructured corpus (10s of millions of documents). The problem domain is super interesting - we’re building a real world “Minority Report” to stop bad actors from abusing the system, and help the good actors get paid immediately, and stop bad medical providers from doing evil.<p>There is a lot of interesting NLP work. The data sets you’d be working with involve individual demographics, job histories, geography mapping, health history, injury causes, recovery and treatment methods, objective witness statements and subjective claimant reports, industry codes, criminology, graph theory and workplace safety, to name a few.<p>People pull crazy schemes every day and get away with it. Few excellent narratives:<p>ProPublica – 19 Jul 19<p>Health Insurers Make It Easy for Scammers to Steal Millions. Who Pays? You. —...

We are super early so you’re getting in on the ground floor, but we are well funded (closed a large seed round recently from several top-tier VC’s in SF and NYC). We already have a large data set and a customer and are seeing early success with our initial model. Our office is in the middle of Manhattan.<p>You’d be working along side industry experts and researchers. We’re building a company culture taking the best engineering and cultural practices from Google and mixing in the freedom of working at a startup.<p>You can publish white papers and speak at conferences.

You can use your favorite tools, including PyTorch and FastAI, and get access to powerful VM’s.<p>If you’re interested in the current position, or want to reach out and stay in touch for when we start hiring again, or want to collaborate because you’re working on a similar problem, connect with me on linkedin (mention hn&#x2F;yc) or email me: tomasv at deepfraud dot com."
"I agree with the conclusion, that what we call homoiconicity is a scalar, not a boolean.

"Feel free to educate me...<p>&gt; The HET is a three-dimensional, circumferential flux, exterior<p>&gt; permanent magnet electric motor with some interesting<p>&gt; characteristics. For starters, it runs four rotors where other motors<p>&gt; typically run one or two. The stator is fully encapsulated in a four<p>&gt; sided &quot;magnetic torque tunnel,&quot; each side having the same polarity,<p>&gt; ensuring that all magnetic fields are in the direction of motion, and<p>&gt; there are no unused ends on the copper coils wasting energy. All<p>&gt; magnetism the system creates is thus used to create motion, and all<p>&gt; four sides of the stator contribute torque to the output.<p>I&#x27;m not so sure about the idea that &quot;unused ends&quot; are &quot;wasting energy&quot;. Simply put your finger on a small spinning motor and watch the current go up - increase the work done, increase the power usage. Typical losses in magnetic motors are:<p>1. Friction - Bearings, brushes, etc<p>2. Air - Typically cooling<p>3. Core - Hysteresis (changing polarity is not possible instantly) and eddy current losses (unwanted current flow)<p>4. Resistance - The coils themselves resist high current<p>Brushless motors are typically 85-90% efficient and brushed typically reach 75-80% efficiency [1]. Reducing the size a little, sure, but increasing the torque - I highly doubt for the same power input. I&#x27;m sure we will get to 95% efficiency within the next 10 years or so (with big money from the automotive industry pushing research), but it&#x27;s highly unlikely we will get more than that outside of the a lab with super-cooled conductors.<p>Which is the other thing, increasing the amount of torque and reducing the size means greater heat generation. Any saving in size you&#x27;re getting gets lost again just keeping the motor cool.<p>Anyway, the promises don&#x27;t pass basic scrutiny, I would definitely need to see some numbers on this. It sounds like snake oil.<p>EDIT: Another thing - electric motors are already very efficient, you&#x27;re getting more loss in other parts, such as voltage regulators, motor control circuitry, batteries (if you&#x27;re using them), cooling, etc, etc. I just don&#x27;t think this will translate to a massive improvement.<p>[1] <a href=""http:&#x2F;&#x2F;dronenodes.com&#x2F;drone-motors-brushless-guide&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;dronenodes.com&#x2F;drone-motors-brushless-guide&#x2F;</a>"

I will pop on a Hong Kong style facemask and push this thing down a staircase.
As a former delivery driver I’m curious how shops get shipments of multiple pallets of...everything? Early in the morning are trucks allowed? are the pallets broken down and handtrucked to each shop?
"Coincidentally this video just popped up in my Youtube feed: &quot;Before Amiga: The Story of the 16-bit Commodore 900&quot; <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=5OpI87v6OqA"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=5OpI87v6OqA</a><p>It asserts that the 900 was an initiative by the German wing of the company, and that the Zilog CPU was considered a strange choice, in the circumstances."
"This article does seem to get at the essence of HN, appreciative of dang and sctb&#x27;s humanity while not ignoring the problems. Personally, I would actually consider it an excellent demonstration of the fallibility of one of HN&#x27;s favourite tropes, Gell-Mann amnesia.<p>If there&#x27;s one critique that I believe is paramount it&#x27;s that HN has, due to its readership, an ethical obligation that goes beyond making discussions all nice and civil.<p>Political issues are obviously divisive and it&#x27;s perfectly fine to keep stuff like the El Paso massacre of the front page. But when hot-button issues intersect with technology, the HN readership is in a position of power, and shouldn&#x27;t routinely be spared the anguish of being reminded of their responsibility.<p>Yes, articles about, for example, discriminatory ML do often make it to the front page. But in my impression, that topic (as well as employment discrimination, culture-wars-adjacent scandals in tech academia etc) are far more likely to be quickly flagged into oblivion than similarly political takes that just happen to be in line with HN&#x27;s prevailing attitude (e.g. cloudflare-shouldnt-ban-&lt;x&gt;).<p>The article impressively articulates what toll divisiveness takes on the moderators: Even if I read the same ugly comments, I am unlikely to experience the sharpness of emotion that apparently comes with considering the community one&#x27;s baby, and making it&#x27;s failures one&#x27;s own. When such divisiveness is then reflected in the &quot;real world&quot; of mass media, the pressure only increases.<p>But as this article shows, abdicating the responsibility by keeping the topics sterile is similarly suspect, in the sense of fiddling while Rome burns. I believe a willingness to confront the ugly sides of technology with some courage of conviction would eventually be recognised, even if it may occasionally involve a bit of a mess."
You can&#x27;t deny Python is versatile language with a moderate learning curve and packages that will do almost anything.<p>These things have made me more productive programmer and allowed me to get stuff done in a reasonable amount of time.

"I find article about DIY chips super exciting. Given how important and ubiquitous chips are I think every university and maybe even schools should have a mini fab to teach the public how sand turns into a computer.<p>I was lucky to have this at my university. We had a professor who build a complete mini fab, mostly from industry donations of discarded equipment. Our semester built a complete and functioning surface acoustic wave (SAW) filter from the wafer to the bonded and housed chip. One of the best practical courses I&#x27;ve ever had."

There&#x27;s another way that I&#x27;ve seen people do it and that&#x27;s farming as a service.  You get people to give you cash upfront for a subscription that guarantees them a certain amount of fruit or vegetables.  You rent all your equipment by the hour to plow and plant the field.  Because your subscribers pay you upfront you have no need to borrow money.<p>The problem with subscription farming?  You have to grow what your customers want to buy not what you want to plant.  If you have a natural disaster you may need to refund some of your customers money.  You also have to learn to sell which to some people is anathema.<p>But I&#x27;ve seen people successfully do it.  There are even people doing it in the inner city of Detroit.  In Detroit with the city selling lots for $100 it may pay to buy your land upfront.  You also can use city water for irrigation.

"This is wonderful work!<p>I wonder if the porous bronze part could be solidified by wicking another (molten) metal into it, the way Bathsheba Grossman’s sculptures are first printed in stainless steel powder, sintered and burned out as in this process, and then infused with molten bronze.<p>Obvious metals to try to solidify bronze in this way would be tin, zinc, lead, and (if you can somehow control oxidation) aluminum. Cadmium or mercury might also work but are attended with difficulties that probably make them impractical."
"I recently cut a technology out of my life that was causing a lot of churn, and I&#x27;m much happier as a result.<p>That technology was TeX, even though it&#x27;s on the author&#x27;s &quot;good&quot; list.<p>It&#x27;s somehow got to a point where every time two people got together to work on a document, we had three different incompatible header files; package X doesn&#x27;t work with version Y of package Z; what order you import packages in matters on my computer but not on a colleague&#x27;s (still not sure why); the order of macro expansion and character class redefinition in some packages causes hard to track down bugs ...<p>80% of what I need to do, I can do in markdown and then run through one of many document-generating tools. Currently for some projects I&#x27;m using gitbook-cli and I&#x27;m both more productive and much happier. I even wonder whether I want to make a fork of gitbook-cli, it&#x27;s something I&#x27;d trust myself to be able to contribute to.<p>For the other 20%, I use word. Yes it&#x27;s a WYSIWYG interface but for short documents (max 20 pages) where layout and design is important to get right, I&#x27;ve found myself being able to save time and frustration compared to TeX.<p>Editor-wise, I use vim or vscode depending on the task. I&#x27;ve tried emacs, we two are not really compatible."
"The pendulum has now swung the other way on the misconception by the general public of mathematicians being great at mental arithmetic, and it&#x27;s become a meme for some mathematicians to take some pride in being average or poor at mental arithmetic. In my experience, most mathematicians (or anyone working in a quantitative field) don&#x27;t have issues quickly approximating 1.6 * X."
Great! Maybe now I can get un-shadowbanned on HN?
"In Germany we&#x27;re assigned to the nearest school.<p>I remember walking to school in elementary school, later taking the bike for 20 min or public transportation. I don&#x27;t live in a particularly dense area.<p>Is Boston too sparsely populated to have schools in walking or biking distance?<p>Seems that we accept distances of 1-2 km for elementary school walks.

"I see this as great news; my first reaction to hearing it was excitement. A lot of comments here are talking about the porn but outside of that, tumblr has a community with a uniquely sardonic sense of humor and is a platform for a host of independent artists and creators, and I would be incredibly sad to see it die. IMO Automattic will make for decent stewards of the platform (hell, anybody would be better than Verizon + Yahoo) and I have cautious optimism for tumblr&#x27;s future."

"Besides garage orphans, also those with self standing homes and a garage will have (or become) a problem.<p>Say that in you street that are 50 single family homes connected to a same cabin&#x2F;transformer.<p>The electric infrastructure powering them (lines, transformer, etc.) has been dimensioned to power them at their average current power consumption rate + something to take care of peaks + something more to take care of eceptions (like - say - a constructions site for the renovation of one of the homes).<p>Now the existing infrastructure will have no issue with your single electric car charging at night, and probably with that of your neighboor on the left and that of your neighbour on the right, but the moment a given number of families will have an electic car, each of them will try to use 5 kW of additional power more or less at the same time.<p>That is a lot of &quot;juice&quot; and it sums up quickly.<p>I believe (correct me if you have better data) that in the US the infrastructure is generally dimensioned for something like 6 or 7 kW per unit, so, adding to each house some &quot;constant&quot; 5 kW (even if only at night) is almost using all the capability of the infrastructure."
"&gt; Britt Small, in fact, says that the only mistake made during the entire ordeal was not killing Trena too<p>Wait, what did Trena do to also be a potential target here?

An Ebola cure is impressive but what&#x27;s just as impressive if not more is the method of getting to the cure. Virus based infections have notoriously been hard to cure once infected. The fact that antibodies can now be engineered to cure a virus-based infection is mind-blowing to me.
"Very much a nitpick, but I really wish the font remained consistent between articles."
"&gt; ...EpiPen’s original cost of around $50 per injector in 2007. That year, Mylan bought the rights to EpiPen and then raised the price more than 400% in the years that followed. The authorized generic is essentially triple the price of what two injectors used to cost.<p>This is outrageous. Nothing new, I know, but every time I read about this I&#x27;m outraged. I trully think there should be a law on maximum margins at least for life saving drugs, or some kind of regulations preventing this phenomenon."
"Can&#x27;t help but feel schadenfreude after a rather nasty interviewing experience at Uber earlier this year.

Stock buy backs lead to higher market concentrations. That’s the biggest economic impact of the past 5-7 years from cheap money afforded to large AND profitable corporations.

"An important caveat for Psychology studies is to ask, &quot;If the participants are told exactly what is being measured, do the results stay the same?&quot; If the answer is &quot;No&quot; you should question the validity of the study.<p>Here for example, if you tell people that &quot;intellectual humility; taking the perspective of others; recognising uncertainty; and having the capacity to search for a compromise.&quot; all lead to &quot;emotional wellbeing, and relationship satisfaction&quot; just prior to taking the test, would that effect size be similar to intentionally omitting that information and having people journal for four weeks?<p>As far as I can tell there was no informed control cohort in this study."

Two actually seems like a lot here. Why would you angle for two and not one? It seems like the latter two (unsafe implementation language and high privilege) are both within the purview of developers. Is it just a case of resource management?

"A growing number of people and organizations are starting to  choose Telegram over Slack. This became prevalent in the blockchain space where pretty much everyone prefers Telegram to other messaging apps. OTC brokers, quant funds, and the largest exchanges use Telegram in some capacity, some almost exclusively.<p>Since the official Telegram clients are open source and the org encourages open competition between third party clients, it&#x27;s now possible to build a Slack-like experience with workspaces, folders, integrations, and hot keys. Telefuel.com is one example.<p>As Telegram launches their $1.7bn blockchain by eoy, it&#x27;ll be interesting to see how they develop their crypto-economy.

One or more US federal agencies place innocent people who happen to work in a sensitive industry on one or more types of watch list that they scrape associated metadata and facial recognition to detect an association with suspicious people&#x2F;criminals&#x2F;persons of interest.

Am I the only one who finds it incredibly hard to grok how async&#x2F;await and &quot;regular&quot; sequential code interplay? In JavaScript I strongly prefer the regular Promise way of doing things because async feels like it&#x27;s mixing metaphors. Being relatively new to Rust it&#x27;s not totally clear to me whether the Futures example in the article could be made more readable - it&#x27;s definitely pretty gross - but I have to wonder.
I’ve run clusters of several thousands machines installed with petabytes of ram with no swap (or even disks).<p>It works just fine however you need to keep a appropriate  headroom to allow the kernel to do its thing with caches as indicated otherwise things get very weird very quickly.<p>Containers are very helpful in this regard for helping explicitly divide a machine up between processes without allowing any one to get out of hand.

In the area are a few small towns which incorporated before being sucked up by Houston, and are much more efficient.  They are called the Villages, and banded together to run their own police, fire, public works, etc.  Instead of dealing with stupid unions, they hire normal private contractors and get things done quickly.  Get rid of your horrible union agreements, and be more like the Villages."

I think the implications of an open source API-only access method for these services are huge for user privacy. Taking reliance off of company-provided JavaScript will result in truer control over what actually gets sent to their servers. Advertising would have to be fought for through client acceptance at the API level. The tradeoff for users is access to new features and accepting more responsibility for upgrading&#x2F;maintaining the interface.

"The difference is in how the output is evaluated.<p>An ML model is evaluated empirically. You compare to real world results and get an accuracy measure. An ML models tells you what something <i>should</i> be. And if it’s a good model, you will get a pretty high frequency of that model telling you what the thing is.<p>Statistics does something entirely different. It tells you what something <i>could</i> be.<p>If you flip a coin, an ML model will tell you if it’s heads or tails. Statistics will tell you how often it will be heads or tails.<p>Another way to think about it is the difference between probability and likelihood.<p>Probability is measured by your theoretical priors and hypotheses. Likelihood is measured by the results of actual trials.<p>The probability of a fair coin landing on heads is .5<p>But the likelihood of that happening isn’t actually .5 because pure frequentist probabilities depend on some fundamentally problematic things. Like a performative infinite number of trials.<p>The actual line between ML and statistics is really blurry because all useful statistical models are at least a little Bayesian. Priors get updated with each trial. This is essentially machine learning.<p>Outside of mostly bad&#x2F;soft sciences (sociology, psychology, neuroscience, nutrition, and climatology are all pretty godawful about abusing classical statistics) pure frequentist statistics don’t get used much because they are really only useful for getting papers published and generating squawking headlines.<p>Most useful statistical methods <i>are</i> machine learning methods. Specifically, they are applied Bayesian methods with weak, randomized priors. Which is exactly what ML is.<p>I sound like I hate statistics. I don’t really. ML models can do a bunch of wacky things. There isn’t a coherent theory behind an ML model. You could point a very good classifier at your wife, and it might tell you [(bird,.1), (apple,.3), (woman,.9)]<p>That’s not a realistic interpretation of what <i>could</i> be. It just happened to get that correct.<p>A really excellent ML model in 2016 could’ve given the following result for president [(trump,.8), (obama,.6), (rock,.5)]. And after the fact when we can compare it to what happened, it would seem accurate.<p>But that doesn’t tell us the range of possibilities in our future. The reality in 2016 was that we weren’t going to elect a fucking rock as president. There was no chance of that. There is zero chance that if I point my camera at my girlfriend, she might actually be a potato. Yeah, the ML model might be right because it has guessed right, and that’s often all we care about.<p>But if I need to know what my chances are of my girlfriend becoming my wife or the mother of my children. That’s where we need statistics. An ML model can’t have those kinds of priors baked in unless you force it. And if you do that you’re just paying someone to do some really expensive Bayesian regression."

The 2% figure is for the bottom quintile. The same source says the median family income for Yale students is 192k. That&#x27;s perfectly consistent with a student who&#x27;s taking on a heavy debt load to not have much disposable income. The family could have several kids, perhaps be paying partial tuition for 2 kids and have basically no money to give their kid aside from the minimum for food and board."

Technical debt is a wonderful ally when building prototypes.<p>Imagine you are building a prototype and you are clever enough to only focus on validating an idea.

"Great story! Couple of minor suggestions.<p>&gt; Before you dig in, note that while sites built in Webflow work in all modern browsers, we don’t actively support use of the Designer in Mozilla Firefox.
Given all that has been said about BigTech, it will be awesome if firefox becomes a priority so that we dont need to use Chrome.<p>One feature suggestion - being able to import CSS and HTML and then work with them. Often I will buy wordpress themes and want to customize them a little bit. Or when I want to move an existing site to maintain it using webflow. This will also open up revenue channel, being able to buy themes from other marketplaces and use them in webflow."
"As a programmer, I am much more facile with powers of 2, than Fibonacci. My way is to double the number 4 times (multiplying by 16) and divide by 10.<p>So for example 55 mph,<p>double 4 times:

"Why? Because most programmers are lazy, arrogant, self-serving <i>children</i>.<p>Given the choice between learning the business – requiring lots of talking to users to understand what they do and why they do it, and then writing very plain uninteresting code that servers those business users’ needs – or learning whizzy new CV-enhancing technologies and using them to invent excitingly complicated and interesting software problems so they can spend all their time solving those problem instead, which do you think the indolent bums are going to embrace?"

"This article helped me to realize I probably should be seeking help for anxiety. I always knew I had anxious tendencies, but I didn&#x27;t ever think I was just &quot;sucking it up&quot; until I read this.<p>I grew up being taught that drinking alcohol is a sin and drugs are evil and your body is sacred. Although I don&#x27;t hold those beliefs myself I can&#x27;t help but be manipulated by them. In actuality, I think I&#x27;m glad I was raised that way because I think I could very well have fallen into a hole of substance abuse. I&#x27;ve had to learn to cope with my anxiety in other ways. I tend to get very stoic and hyper-focused on problems that make me anxious. I try to use logic to find solutions or--more likely--to find a way to run away and avoid the problem. It hasn&#x27;t always been easy on my marriage; fortunately I think my wife understands these emotions I have better than I do.<p>I don&#x27;t know if this is generally true, but for myself, I think the problem has gotten worse as my family has become more and more dependent on me to survive. My wife skipped getting an education to raise a family and as I make more and more each year and our lifestyle gets more and more comfortable then I feel this pressure building up to not fail. If my 18-year-old self could see me now he would be shocked. I&#x27;m totally risk-averse, far more introverted, and far more anxious. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s totally a bad thing, it keeps me and my family protected to a degree, but like everything in life it&#x27;s a sacrifice. I sacrifice some unknown quality of life to keep what I have now.<p>I find that sometimes I wish it would all come crashing down. That I would lose my job, lose my home, or worse. I think I fantasize about these possibilities sometimes because although they scare me I recognize that I might need an external force to change a life with too much momentum. To be clear, I&#x27;m pretty happy. I love my family, I have a decent job with fantastic coworkers, I make good money. I don&#x27;t have suicidal thoughts, I&#x27;m not &quot;healthy&quot; but I don&#x27;t abuse substances. That&#x27;s all great, but somehow it isn&#x27;t enough by itself. I&#x27;m just an anxious man I guess."
Their tricky licensing makes using Qt for personal projects a non-starter and anything commercial really hard to justify.<p>If they streamlined the licensing and created (C)sensible language bindings then it would be great.

"My interpretation of the point the author is trying to make:<p>The &#x27;hypersane&#x27; are those among us who have realized, for better or for worse, that the traditional things that most in a society strive for - material wealth, social status, conformity to social structures, etc. - aren&#x27;t really the keys to happiness and that when you &quot;awaken&quot; (and become hypersane, I suppose) you realize that along with those things come stress, anxiety, the rat race, and, well, a pretty boring existence.<p>I dig it!  I expect to see a lot of folks reject this notion outright, because, well, cognitive dissonance.  If you&#x27;ve built your life around conforming, it might be tough to hear someone suggest it&#x27;s all for naught.<p>Thoughts?"

"I currently use a mix of SaltStack in masterless mode (for system-wide configuration) and Makefile (for user-specific configuration), both in the same git repository, and it handles pretty much everything fine, including idempotency.<p>The thing is, it doesn&#x27;t age well: it works for me because I take care of it on a regular basis but it probably wouldn&#x27;t help much a few years from now if left unmaintained.<p>-*-<p>I started using SaltStack in masterless mode 5 years ago, and I won&#x27;t be looking back. It handles both packet installation and consistent system-wide configuration. It was perfect for a single desktop computer running Kubuntu at the time, and it&#x27;s perfect now for 9 different computers (servers, desktops and laptops) with widely different hardware specs, 3 different distros (Debian, Kubuntu and Arch) and very different use cases (servers, gaming stations and family computers).<p>The Makefile is an idempotent replacement for a shell script I wrote for NetBSD 15 years ago. It handles user configuration and works on pretty much all OSes I use (including Windows, Solaris and AIX) without requiring a root &#x2F; admin account.<p>With this mix, I can setup a new computer with a known distro in a few minutes: setting the hostname, selecting the profile (server, gaming…) and the list of users which will get access to it. Installing on a new distro (including an upgraded version of a known distro) usually requires a few tweaks, so it can take up to a few hours to get everything working — that&#x27;s still way better than spending weeks or months for some inconsistent and buggy result, but keep this in mind if new distros is the only scenario you&#x27;re interested in.<p>I don&#x27;t migrate data: I prefer having as little as possible on each individual computer."
"The big win seems to be the lock file - like Cargo in Rust, or yarn in the JS world.

"The fundamental problem is &quot;player benefits from minimizing risk&quot;, which is usually boring. It happens in most genres, e.g. it&#x27;s especially bad in roguelikes, where luring enemies to doors is a common tactic.<p>Of the proposed solutions: cover, hidden information, and enemy leashing are only obfuscating the low-risk path, not actually removing it. A good player is still rewarded for boring play, e.g. bouncing grenades at the leashed enemies.<p>Rewarding risk-taking is a good solution, but hard to implement in a FPS because there are only so many rewards you can give.<p>One-way paths are criticized for breaking exploration, but I think it&#x27;s possible to get the benefits of them while still allowing exploration. Consider Ninja Gaiden for the NES. It spawns enemies when you cross certain thresholds, and crucially it does this every time you cross them, even if you already defeated the enemies. This punishes retreat by undoing any progress you made. You&#x27;re forced to take risks, and it&#x27;s IMO a better game because of it.<p>Some people call Ninja Gaiden unfair, but I think that&#x27;s because they didn&#x27;t understand the mechanic. You could get the same benefits while making it easier to understand, and more fair feeling, e.g.:<p>* Clearly mark the spawn triggers<p>* Visually show the triggers activating, e.g. with particle effects flying from them to the enemy spawn points<p>* Don&#x27;t let the enemies harm the player immediately after spawning, so the player has time to react.<p>* Cap the number of active enemies and the spawn rate from each spawn trigger (Ninja Gaiden has sprite limits, but you can still produce absurd-looking spawn patterns by repeatedly crossing the trigger point).<p>Ninja Gaiden also has time limits, which are IMO an underrated method of punishing boring play. Time limits aren&#x27;t fashionable in modern games, but I think they should be brought back. They&#x27;re compatible with exploration by including hidden bonus time powerups."

"I developed an RSI a few years ago, and I had to leave my job. It was devastating to lose both my career and my passion to an injury.<p>Since then, I&#x27;ve been working with a friend on a new voice coding app called Serenade [1] that aims to enable anyone to program by voice. With Serenade, you can speak natural English voice commands like &quot;delete second function&quot; and &quot;add class person&quot;. Not only can this be faster than typing, but it also means you don&#x27;t have to memorize the syntax details of every language or a bunch of editor keyboard shortcuts.<p>We found that cloud speech APIs and programs like Dragon weren&#x27;t accurate enough for common programming words, so we built a custom speech engine (based on Kaldi [2]) that&#x27;s designed specifically for coding. The app is still early, but we think the future of programming is working with these higher-level inputs rather than typing out code entirely by hand.<p>We&#x27;re looking for people to give feedback, so if anyone is interested in giving it a try, you can download Serenade at [3] or email me at matt@serenade.ai.<p>[1] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;serenade.ai"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;serenade.ai</a><p>[2] <a href=""http:&#x2F;&#x2F;kaldi-asr.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;kaldi-asr.org</a><p>[3] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;serenade.ai&#x2F;download"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;serenade.ai&#x2F;download</a>"

"Hacker News is a well-moderated community, but it&#x27;s illustrative to see where Hacker News fails at moderation. While Hacker News is great at protecting the community from disruptive individuals, it tends to fall down when protecting unpopular individuals against the community turned mob.<p>I support Hacker News moderating itself however it chooses. However, if we are looking at it as a moderation model for large, open, non-editorial platforms (Youtube, Facebook) -- which I believe should all be covered under public accommodation law -- it clearly fails. And even if when we are looking at ostensibly neutral, publicly-orientated sites like newspaper comment boards, it fails.<p>Hacker News moderation is not appealable, not auditable, does not have bright line rules, and there are no due process rights. It simply does not respect individual rights.<p>So while this moderation method succeeds for Hacker News, and perhaps should become the model for small private sites, we should not try to scale it internet-size companies. Platform companies (Google, Facebook, Twitter) and backbone companies (ISPs, Cloudflare!) need a different set of rules geared towards protecting individual rights and freedoms instead of protecting a community."

"I wonder if this is a reason people find prayer so meaningful, aside from any metaphysical&#x2F;supernatural beliefs. Though I&#x27;ve left organized religion and am probably some sort of agnostic theist, I still occasionally pray. I don&#x27;t ask for outcomes anymore, as it&#x27;s pretty clear to me that tragedy and fortune visit the pious and impious all the same. Yet, it brings me some comfort and clarity to externalize my hopes, fears, and joys, all the same. Perhaps our rich, egoistic inner life as humans is really useful for the steady-state of the systems we&#x27;ve invented for ourselves, but unsuited for navigating disruptions. For that, we created mechanisms to dissolve our fragile egos and externalize our thinking."

Even that I doubt, since routers are made by a handful of major companies and IoT devices are made by hundreds of fly-by-night outfits who&#x27;re likely to be out of business in five years."

"I used to really like XFCE and it was my daily driver on my laptop for 6years because it was no compromises on performance type of GUI.

"Something about this article doesn&#x27;t add up. According to the article:<p><pre><code>  1. Brands charge a premium of 10x-20x compared to generics.

  3. Brands pay 50% kickbacks to middle men (so cut =  revenue neutral).
  4. Offering the cheaper version kills real generic competition.

"From Michael Jordan’s reddit AMA<p>I personally don&#x27;t make the distinction between statistics and machine learning that your question seems predicated on.<p>Also I rarely find it useful to distinguish between theory and practice; their interplay is already profound and will only increase as the systems and problems we consider grow more complex.<p>Think of the engineering problem of building a bridge. There&#x27;s a whole food chain of ideas from physics through civil engineering that allow one to design bridges, build them, give guarantees that they won&#x27;t fall down under certain conditions, tune them to specific settings, etc, etc. I suspect that there are few people involved in this chain who don&#x27;t make use of &quot;theoretical concepts&quot; and &quot;engineering know-how&quot;. It took decades (centuries really) for all of this to develop.<p>Similarly, Maxwell&#x27;s equations provide the theory behind electrical engineering, but ideas like impedance matching came into focus as engineers started to learn how to build pipelines and circuits. Those ideas are both theoretical and practical.<p>We have a similar challenge---how do we take core inferential ideas and turn them into engineering systems that can work under whatever requirements that one has in mind (time, accuracy, cost, etc), that reflect assumptions that are appropriate for the domain, that are clear on what inferences and what decisions are to be made (does one want causes, predictions, variable selection, model selection, ranking, A&#x2F;B tests, etc, etc), can allow interactions with humans (input of expert knowledge, visualization, personalization, privacy, ethical issues, etc, etc), that scale, that are easy to use and are robust. Indeed, with all due respect to bridge builders (and rocket builders, etc), but I think that we have a domain here that is more complex than any ever confronted in human society.<p>I don&#x27;t know what to call the overall field that I have in mind here (it&#x27;s fine to use &quot;data science&quot; as a placeholder), but the main point is that most people who I know who were trained in statistics or in machine learning implicitly understood themselves as working in this overall field; they don&#x27;t say &quot;I&#x27;m not interested in principles having to do with randomization in data collection, or with how to merge data, or with uncertainty in my predictions, or with evaluating models, or with visualization&quot;. Yes, they work on subsets of the overall problem, but they&#x27;re certainly aware of the overall problem. Different collections of people (your &quot;communities&quot;) often tend to have different application domains in mind and that makes some of the details of their current work look superficially different, but there&#x27;s no actual underlying intellectual distinction, and many of the seeming distinctions are historical accidents.<p>I also must take issue with your phrase &quot;methods more squarely in the realm of machine learning&quot;. I have no idea what this means, or could possibly mean. Throughout the eighties and nineties, it was striking how many times people working within the &quot;ML community&quot; realized that their ideas had had a lengthy pre-history in statistics. Decision trees, nearest neighbor, logistic regression, kernels, PCA, canonical correlation, graphical models, K means and discriminant analysis come to mind, and also many general methodological principles (e.g., method of moments, which is having a mini-renaissance, Bayesian inference methods of all kinds, M estimation, bootstrap, cross-validation, EM, ROC, and of course stochastic gradient descent, whose pre-history goes back to the 50s and beyond), and many many theoretical tools (large deviations, concentrations, empirical processes, Bernstein-von Mises, U statistics, etc). Of course, the &quot;statistics community&quot; was also not ever that well defined, and while ideas such as Kalman filters, HMMs and factor analysis originated outside of the &quot;statistics community&quot; narrowly defined, there were absorbed within statistics because they&#x27;re clearly about inference. Similarly, layered neural networks can and should be viewed as nonparametric function estimators, objects to be analyzed statistically.<p>In general, &quot;statistics&quot; refers in part to an analysis style---a statistician is happy to analyze the performance of any system, e.g., a logic-based system, if it takes in data that can be considered random and outputs decisions that can be considered uncertain. A &quot;statistical method&quot; doesn&#x27;t have to have any probabilities in it per se. (Consider computing the median).<p>When Leo Breiman developed random forests, was he being a statistician or a machine learner? When my colleagues and I developed latent Dirichlet allocation, were we being statisticians or machine learners? Are the SVM and boosting machine learning while logistic regression is statistics, even though they&#x27;re solving essentially the same optimization problems up to slightly different shapes in a loss function? Why does anyone think that these are meaningful distinctions?<p>I don&#x27;t think that the &quot;ML community&quot; has developed many new inferential principles---or many new optimization principles---but I do think that the community has been exceedingly creative at taking existing ideas across many fields, and mixing and matching them to solve problems in emerging problem domains, and I think that the community has excelled at making creative use of new computing architectures. I would view all of this as the proto emergence of an engineering counterpart to the more purely theoretical investigations that have classically taken place within statistics and optimization.<p>But one shouldn&#x27;t definitely not equate statistics or optimization with theory and machine learning with applications. The &quot;statistics community&quot; has also been very applied, it&#x27;s just that for historical reasons their collaborations have tended to focus on science, medicine and policy rather than engineering. The emergence of the &quot;ML community&quot; has (inter alia) helped to enlargen the scope of &quot;applied statistical inference&quot;. It has begun to break down some barriers between engineering thinking (e.g., computer systems thinking) and inferential thinking. And of course it has engendered new theoretical questions.<p>I could go on (and on), but I&#x27;ll stop there for now..."

Even just doing something simple like posting a release notification to Slack seems to end up with me having the action triggered a random number of times causing multiple messages being posted to slack. The whole  experience feels amateur and clunky.<p>There are issues open to look into it but no fix in sight yet. While this announcement sounds useful, don&#x27;t throw away your current CI&#x2F;CD tooling which is probably a lot nicer to use.<p>Lastly I really dislike how pretty much any really useful actions are created and maintained by single people. There are just some actions I&#x27;d want to see be supported by GitHub, I don&#x27;t wan to have to handover things like Slack access keys to a non-trusted third party to post messages.<p>Every time I try to use actions I&#x27;m surprised it was launched in it&#x27;s current obscure, unpolished state."

"The world at large doesn&#x27;t care what you need, only what you can offer. Realizing this (and acting on it) would help vast majority of these &quot;socially excluded young men&quot; to be included instead.<p>There is an excellent article detailing the idea here:

"I guess I don&#x27;t get all this &quot;monad&quot; stuff. This article talks about 3 types of monad. An optional, a list, and a future.<p>However an optional is really just a list constrained to size 0 or 1. And a future is often called &quot;not truly a monad.&quot;<p>So I question the value of explaining this abstraction in great detail over so many articles when people struggle to come up with more than 1 concrete example of it (Lists), an example that engineers have already understood since our first month coding.<p>Maybe somebody can speak to this more."
"&gt; The way to grow from this book is to deeply learn what they did and how they did it, and then try to rewrite page 13 in a number of ways. How nicely can this be written in “a lisp” using recursion. How nicely can this be written without recursion? (In both cases, look ahead in the book to see that Lisp 1.5 had gotten to the idea of EXPRs and FEXPRs (functions which don’t eval their arguments before the call — thus they can be used to replace all the “special forms” — do a Lisp made from FEXPRs and get the rest by definition, etc.).<p>Found it ironic that in a comment about Lisp, Kay forgot to balance his parens. :)"
"For what it&#x27;s worth, I have none of the issues the currently top voted comments describe. Dependency hell (apt does that for me), closer to burnout any time I work with it, would rather work with C++ (a language with a completely different purpose)? If the author of the article had written this, people would fall over themselves to say how wrong they are. Nearly everyone who tried Python loves it. From this thread you&#x27;d think we&#x27;re talking about Visual Basic for Applications.<p>There is a reason Python is one of the most popular languages. PHP was popular because it&#x27;s quick and dirty, but Python is popular because people love working with it. The arguments in this thread are beyond me. (They&#x27;re also unsubstantiated, but if I ask for substantiation I&#x27;m sure someone can rationalize some reasons to dislike any language, so that&#x27;s pointless.)"
"I think what folks are missing is that a lot of these &quot;zero-click&quot; searches happen as a result of Google scraping your website, and displaying the results as a &quot;featured snippet.&quot;<p>Yes, they link to you below the featured snippet.<p>No, more people don&#x27;t click, because they&#x27;ve taken the answer from your website and displayed it right in their search results.<p>For example: If I&#x27;m searching for &quot;best nail for cedar wood&quot; Google gives me the answer: STAINLESS STEEL - and I never had to click through to the website that gave the answer: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bit.ly&#x2F;2MdovdP"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bit.ly&#x2F;2MdovdP</a><p>• Yes, this is good for users (it would also be good for users if Netflix gave away movies free)<p>• Overall, the publishers who &quot;rank&quot; for this query receive fewer clicks<p>• Google earns more ad revenue as users stick around on Google longer<p>Ironically, Google has a policy against scraping their results, but their whole business model is predicated off scraping other sites and making money off the content - in many cases never sending traffic (or significantly reduced traffic) to the publisher of the content."

"I saw an interesting pitch from <i>Sparkcharge</i> [1] at an incubator event, which is deliverable super charger batteries.<p>If it scales, it would essentially allow people to order charging on the fly, get it delivered&#x2F;hooked up by an Uber driver, and then just leave it for pickup in the lot they parked in.

"Tech Debt, to me, grows with every line of code you write that didn&#x27;t replace a line of code. Consider how many projects start with the idea, &#x27;I&#x27;ll rewrite this and get rid of the tech debt&#x27;.<p>First, If the original code isn&#x27;t deleted, you&#x27;ve added to the tech debt. Now every new engineer will need to learn two chunks of code, and every existing engineer will need to support both.<p>Second, unless you&#x27;ve had a major epiphany between the old code and the new code, you&#x27;re more likely to run into the trap of the first example. Major epiphany&#x27;s could be, &#x27;wow, we really didn&#x27;t need all of that extra stuff&#x27;, or, &#x27;we&#x27;ve duplicated so much code, we should re-organize this all&#x27;.<p>I&#x27;ve been at plenty of companies where you have to understand that the Perl code is really old and these components use that, the Mason rewrite was 80% done and is over there, the Next Gen code was in Ruby these components do that. But now, we&#x27;re embarking on a new Node&#x2F;React project to replace all of it, finally going to get rid of the tech debt! (Said with no sarcasm)"
Wow this is really amazing. The amount of effort here and critical thought is eye-opening and obviously compelling. Why is this an outlier trait? What makes these qualities hard to attain for the rest? Applying this methodology requires mostly... critical thinking? Care?

"I&#x27;m trying to really understand the problem here.<p>I do understand that people want clicks to their site so that they can get ad views, and that those ad view payments are what pay the hosting bill and reimburse for the effort of generating the info.<p>Yet from a UX PoV, I simply want to know the airspeed of an unladen swallow.  I don&#x27;t want to click to learn it.  That additional friction doesn&#x27;t improve my user experience, it improves someone else&#x27;s.  Mandating that would turn Google into a splash screen or landing page, and we&#x27;ve gotten rid of those anti patterns for good reasons.<p>I chose my toy example (unladen swallow) because it&#x27;s an example where nuance is required (African or European?) and if google&#x27;s answer box were to obscure that it would be wrong.  But if answers that with a &quot;two answers: African x European y, and click here to know more&quot; that is a user-friendly model.<p>Really objecting to google doing this is like objecting to an ad blocker IMHO.  Ad blockers upset sites, but make users happy.<p>(anti disclaimer and disclaimer: I am not a fan of google, use DDG, and my company has ditched all google services.

"Remember that article yesterday about the company that resold movie tickets at a loss to gain market share? That&#x27;s Uber&#x27;s business model.<p>(Self driving cars were never going to save them. Not only do they not work yet, there&#x27;s no reason to think they&#x27;d be much cheaper for years to come. Uber would have to pay for them, garage them, maintain them, operate control centers, etc. They&#x27;d be in the car rental business, which is not hugely profitable. Uber&#x27;s business model is to dump their operating costs on their drivers. With self driving cars, they couldn&#x27;t do that.)"

"We have a similar subscription model in the UK for Cineworld. For a monthly fee you can go to the cinema as much as you like.<p>The key difference is, the monthly fee costs about 50% more than a single ticket, and you’ll be lucky to have more than 2 or 3 movies you want to watch each month, with the obvious dry-spells where nothing really appeals. Since it also gives a discount on snacks (already hugely expensive), it’s just a way to sell more sweets and pop.<p>It pays for itself after two films, when there <i>are</i> two worth watching, and as long as you don’t bother with snacks. Cineworld easily claws back some of that money when you skip the cinema for one month, or only go once.<p>It seems a lot better thought through than what turned out to be a free-for-all cinema subsidy with MoviePass."
I like the streetlight idea for getting more chargers out there.  It&#x27;d also be great if every parking meter had at least a trickle-charger.<p>Hopefully solar efficiencies will continue to improve to the point where trickle charging via solar is actually viable.

"You’d be surprised how easy it <i>still</i> is to hitchhike across America, and how many good people you’ll meet.<p>A friend of mine persuaded me to try it a few years back. I was skeptical. I’d heard the cautionary tales, figured the narrative that we’ve become a low-trust society was basically correct, and definitely didn’t expect people to invite <i>two</i> strange men into their car. And yet that is exactly what happened, 3 or 4 times a day, for a week and a thousand miles.<p>Not everyone was a shining beacon of light, but some genuinely were, and the cross section of humanity was a continual surprise. (The article captures this well.) There was a bagpiper, a young ex-marine, a woman who may have been stealing ming vases, a social worker and her sister who took us on a tour of the Snake River, and an air traffic controller on the way to his mother’s funeral. He only mentioned that about 4 hours in. A common thread was that people were in a “real” place in life. We were too — hitchhiking asks you to be vulnerable. You might stand by an on-ramp for the better part of a day while a stream of cars passes you and passes judgment on you. You learn to let go of things you can’t control.<p>I had to end my trip in Salt Lake City, a place I didn’t know much about and had never thought of visiting. I loved it so much I left NYC and moved here. It’s been 8 years now. Funny to think it all started with a hitchhike! You never know what’s out on the road."

"Did you know a huge part of the cost of operating an electric subway is the delays involved in getting a dollars from every person who gets on through a slow down called the fare box. Another is a stooge whose only task is to open&#x2F;close doors. Another stooge starts and stop the cars. In Toronto these stooges get about $50 US per hour for salary, pension and various benefits. That is $150 an hour.
Elevators were like that years ago. They had operators, and in a fully automatic elevator, they would ask you what floor and push that button. Then they fired them. End of the earth is looming said their union. Ho-hum said thje world.
We need fully self driving subway cars, with fitted electic doors on the cars and on the track - just like the doors that stop you falling down the shaft on an elevator.
That way subway operating costs would fall by 60% or more.
WE also need fully tracked packaging. Buy a wrapped chocolate bar and they know who paid for it, and you pay a25 cent wrapper deposit. Toss away the box and they know who tossed it = fee for you. Dispose properly and the candy wrapper deposit is scanned and paid to you.
We are going to have to deal with our trash. This applies to all trash, even on the high seas.
The UN, after 20 years, needs to declare coal burning plants and act of war against mankind = cruise missile to destroy it. Cars must all be electric in 20 years. Any after that confiscated unless converted to batteries. No excuses.

"I don&#x27;t know what Uber thinks its end game is. Uber&#x27;s &quot;lets burn money to capture the market and own self driving&quot; stratagem is economically absurd. In the limit of driverless cars, capital can be turned directly into labor so anyone with capital will deploy a fleet so long as it is profitable. Talk about a red ocean. The self-driving dream investors pin their hopes on is a siren. Ironically, Uber will only be able to maintain value in those futures where driverless cars don&#x27;t work out.<p>Commodities do not have network effects. In general, if you are replacing labor with capital (in the form of automation) you will not get the network effects of a two-sided market - which is basically a market failure caused by our previous inability to convert capital into labor in a manner that scales. If you are replacing a two-sided market with automation you are going to need another moat."

On one hand it’s useful because I can recycle the code but it also helps track how I’ve spent my time. I also tried to keep a diary but this was less successful.<p>I learned the hard way that being helpful is not always recognised, in fact I’ve had one manager openly hostile to the idea even if that meant the project would fail, it annoyed the hell out of me. (This manager came back from his MBA promoting a Whiplash approach to management and told us to actively ‘destroy’ the other teams in our company so there you go.) This was part of the reason I moved back to academia, now my job is to help young engineers be the best they can."

"Interesting - so is it &quot;a thing&quot; in the US that the city runs a dedicated bus service for all schools&#x2F;students? Quite a surprise for me considering how poor people say public transport is in general in the US?<p>In the UK some schools run their own bus things (in the same way that Goolge, Facebook et al do in San Francisco), but most of the other schools just get by with the public buses.<p>There is often some coordination to make sure buses stop at&#x2F;very near schools, and they may send extra ones at certain times - e.g. there were often several buses parked up and waiting empty at my school so they could be filled at the end of the school day, but any member of the public was then able to get onboard once it was on its usual route after that, and if you were late getting out (e.g. detention&#x2F;sports etc) you&#x27;d just wait at the stop outside the school for the usual bus on its usual route to come by.<p>What do the US school buses and their drivers do for the rest of the day and on weekends? Just sit idle?"
"I find the other extreme, as in the USA, more dangerous. Therefore the question &quot;Who owns the US government?&quot; could be asked too.<p>Someone could look into example of Boeing and the FAA. The more we learn about 737-Max and 787 Dreamliner certification the more it&#x27;s obvious that Boeing is running the FAA.<p>Another example is the FDA. Good example here is Monsanto. While it was under US ownership everything was fine. Once it got sold to Bayer, suddenly stuff is carcinogenic. What I want to say is, that everybody knew since more than a decade before the transaction, that the stuff is carcinogenic. This seems to me like the FAA was protecting Monsanto before it was sold off."

"I liked this article, though I think it missed the best part of Hacker News. To me, Hacker News can feel like walking through Dumbledore&#x27;s office -- magical and mind-bending collections of incredible devices, ideas, and oddities.<p>Just yesterday someone posted a comment with links to UI design libraries that I&#x27;ve been subconsciously wishing for in my dreams (humaans, undraw.co), and I used it in a product demo. As a self-taught technologist, HN has exposed me to SICP, functional programming, and just yesterday someone posted a book about Data Structures and Algorithms that I started reading. Dang was quoted as describing HN as a &quot;hall of mirrors&quot; or &quot;fractal tree.&quot;<p>The author&#x27;s focus on the controversial political parts of HN seems to me like going to a music festival and commenting on the food trucks. Yes, it&#x27;s part of the experience, but that&#x27;s not why people go and not what makes it magical.<p>Communicating the beauty of unfamiliar technical topics to a lay reader is much harder than politics, but the New Yorker has done well at that elsewhere (I like the Sanjay and Jeff profile). Moderation is an interesting topic in its own right, though, especially in the age of the IRA and meme-warfare."

"GitHub is way late to the game here. I personally have started moving away from GitHub. They don&#x27;t even offer an open source version, yet try to claim to be some gift for open source. GitLab is better, but their architecture is a bit more complicated than it should be. I really like sites that use Gitea, but they haven&#x27;t integrated CI&#x2F;CD like GitLab, nor have they proven to scale with their own hosted solution. When I think about the point of these solutions though, there is a lot of opportunity here. Heck, Git is decentralized and distributed by itself. Really people just want a place to manage their issues and MRs, and I hope someone will decentralize that with a native app and then add additional features that integrate into multiple providers with ease."
"I think monads highlight something underappreciated about programming, which is that different people regard very different things as &quot;intuitive&quot;. It almost seems that modalities of thinking about programming are bigger, external things than programming itself. Certainly they&#x27;re barriers to learning.<p>Like Lisp, there seems to be about 10% of the programmer population who think &quot;ah this is obviously the clearest way to do it&quot; and the remaining 90% who go &quot;huh?&quot;, and the 10% are really bad at explaining it in a way the others can grasp.<p>The two monad explainers that really resonated with me were:<p>- How do you deal with state in a language that would prefer to be stateless? Answer: wrap <i>the entire external universe</i> and all its messy state up into an object, then pass that down a chain of functions which can return &quot;universe, but with some bytes written to the network&quot; (IO monad)<p>- If you have a set of objects with the same mutually pluggable connectors on both ends, you can daisy-chain them in any order like extension cables or toy train tracks.<p>(It&#x27;s a joke, but people need to recognise why &quot;A monad is just a monoid in the category of endofunctors&quot; is a bad explanation 99% of the time and understand how to produce better explanations)"
"I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s anything very special about the CTO role here. A lot of this applies to any executive role. As the company scales the role will change enormously and you might have to change the person doing it.<p>The one thing I would say though is don&#x27;t hand out a title like CTO early. It&#x27;s overly grand, reduces your flexibility to change and just isn&#x27;t necessary. It&#x27;s very tempting for a small team to give out grand titles but it&#x27;s a mistake. Sure someone has to be CEO, but no one has to be CTO."
"This concept seems unhelpfully reductive and transparently targeted at people who feel a need for self-congratulation on account of being alienated by the &quot;normal&quot; people, although alienation is paradoxically also portrayed as one of the markers of being painfully ordinary.<p><pre><code>  &quot;Many ‘normal’ people suffer from not being hypersane: 
   they have a restricted worldview, confused priorities,
   and are wracked by stress, anxiety and self-deception. 
   [...] In contrast, hypersane people are calm, contained 
   and constructive. It is not just that the ‘sane’ are 
   irrational but that they lack scope and range, [...]&quot;
</code></pre>
All of these things are orthogonal traits and can occur in an individual in any combination. For example, I would categorize myself as having a moderately open worldview, mostly straight priorities, not wracked by stress and anxiety, moderate to severe self-deception, calm, contained, and mostly constructive. So which one am I? A barely conscious pleb or an advanced rational intelligence?<p>It seems to me these kinds of characterizations are really the product of people trying to build a framework that appreciates their (subjectively underappreciated) positive traits. It&#x27;s obviously not wrong to celebrate those traits, especially when confronted with their opposites so publicly on a daily basis, but the problem arises when we&#x27;re trying to bundle those traits up under a buzzword package name. People are very diverse, and their traits and behaviors develop over time.<p>I allege that it is more helpful to look at the positively connotated traits mentioned here in isolation, and work on improving aspects of ourselves in a targeted manner, as opposed to subscribing to a blanket identity (in this case <i>hypersanity</i>, which is ultimately meaningless). There needs to be less emphasis on &quot;what identity am I innately&quot; and more emphasis on &quot;what properties do I like about myself and which ones do I want to improve&quot;. The difference here is not only one of nuance and constructiveness, but also one of fundamental outlook."

"Stupid question: but how is this the case? The fare I pay for an Uber or Lyft seems much higher than the time&#x2F;car&#x2F;insurance cost of driving myself ($30-$50 for a 25 min ride to SFO).

A word about the &quot;faggot&quot; usage: it was a necessary tool. It showed three things: they were not in control, if they were the usage would have be stopped. Everyone out there needed to see t%his. Two, it made it unpleasant for them to be in the headspace, which has obvious advantages. Three, it pointed out impersonators of BS because they would not call each other faggot, thus helping to mitigate the spread of false information.

"The warrant revealed that a BBC contractor had used an &quot;optical detector&quot; to reveal the possible presence of a TV.[10] The warrant stated that: &quot;the optical detector in the detector van uses a large lens to collect that light and focus it on to an especially sensitive device, which converts fluctuating light signals into electrical signals, which can be electronically analysed. If a receiver is being used to watch broadcast programmes then a positive reading is returned.&quot; [10] The BBC stated that this was strong evidence that a set was &quot;receiving a possible broadcast&quot;.<p>According to The Comptroller and Auditor General of the National Audit Office, &quot;where the BBC still suspects that an occupier is watching live television but not paying for a licence, it can send a detection van to check whether this is the case. TVL detection vans can identify viewing on a non‐TV device in the same way that they can detect viewing on a television set. BBC staff were able to demonstrate this to my staff in controlled conditions sufficient for us to be confident that they could detect viewing on a range of non‐TV devices.&quot;<p>---<p>That device description is entirely consistent with a video camera, perhaps with a telescope in front of it, used for peering through people&#x27;s windows.<p>Does this put the BBC at risk of violating anti-peeping-Tom legislation?"

"About six years I was on the losing end of a head-on motorcycle vs. SUV collision, breaking both of my wrists (as well as a broken right femur and several other injuries that were minor in comparison).<p>I had &quot;casts&quot; that wrapped around my arms from mid-bicep to the tips of my fingers. Additionally, I couldn&#x27;t walk due to the broken leg. There were a few months where 99% of my time was spent lying down in bed.<p>The solution to my &quot;can&#x27;t type&quot; problem was a pair of standard #2 pencils. I had them pushed up into the ends of the casts so that the eraser end was sticking out and basically just &quot;hunted and pecked&quot; with my &quot;two fingers&quot; until all of the surgeries and subsequent healing were complete.<p>After a while I got pretty good at it too. I wasn&#x27;t doing &quot;touch typing&quot; at ~120 wpm obviously but it was probably close to the days when I sent and received Morse code at ~18 wpm.<p>Luckily, this only lasted for a few months and then I was all healed up and back to normal. My doctors said I should expect arthritis at a relatively early age, though, and that carpal tunnel was certainly a good possibility too, so at some point I may need to come up with a better solution than a couple pencils -- something more like what the author here managed. Hopefully I&#x27;ve got a few more years left and the technology and available tools will continue to progress in that time."

I have allocated off-street parking under my apartment that is actually owned by us as part of the lease, but I doubt the building management will let me install a charger, and I don&#x27;t think the law in the UK means I can force them to let me.<p>In London there are a few public chargers dotted around, but they are fairly infrequent. I don&#x27;t have any data but it feels like there are perhaps 2 public on-street chargers for perhaps every 10 to 20 residential streets.<p>The nearest one to me is about a 15-20 minute walk away, and if I get there and it is full or broken, then what? Try the next charger that is 30-40 minutes walk away?! The contention ratio of homes to chargers is insane - it must be in the 500-1000:1 level (guessing)<p>There are however lampposts <i>everywhere</i>. There is some talk of adding charging points to lampposts but I think there are only very small-scale trials at the moment. If I could rely on every lamppost also being a charger then I&#x27;d buy an EV literally today.<p>Sadly, right now it feels like PHEVs are a more sensible option until public infrastructure catches up."
"The real tragedy was it didn&#x27;t really do anything for Hoover, didn&#x27;t promote their product, merely turned it into a tool to acquire something else of more value.<p>Hoover was no longer selling their stuff to the consumer, the sale was guaranteed - whether they made a good product or not - it was selling airline tickets.  I would think quality went down as manufacturing realized they could cut corners and no one would really notice.  So they probably pushed out a lot of junkier vacuums.<p>They lost their brand notoriety along with it, as people probably now thought of hoover as &quot;the place where we could scam some cheap airline tickets&quot; instead of where to go to get good appliances.<p>This is where the (illusion of) profit became more important than the product for the board and that took the company down with it."

I&#x27;ve been told that my choice of python was poor numerous times. &#x27;Do java&#x2F;.net&#x27; etc. is something I&#x27;ve heard all throughout my career. I use python because it doesn&#x27;t work against me - It&#x27;s not the best language but I think its definitely the most versatile. I love python and it will be around for another decade I guarantee it.

This is shitty &quot;science&quot;-journalism parroting a common misconception.<p>After all, the only reason we associate infrared with &quot;heat&quot; in the first place is that it&#x27;s useful for detecting things which happen to be at a range of temperatures, temperatures which <i>just happen</i> to be slightly warmer than the operating state of self-reproducing bags-of-mostly-water on a small rocky planet."

"I&#x27;d like to add that RHEL5 was more than tolerable in this aspect.  Whatever kernel series it lived through, it seemed logical. We knew when RHEL5 systems started to swap that was our sign to A) look for long term usage growth that is beginning to bump some threshold somewhere B) someone turned a knob they shouldn&#x27;t have C) a recent code change has caused a problem in the application stack<p>Then RHEL6 came along, and it swapped all the time.  Gone was our warning. The stats shows tens of gigabytes of cache engaged. WUT? How do we have tens of gigabytes of memory doing nothing? Before you could finish that thought, OOM killer was killing off programs due to memory pressure.  WTF?  The system is swallowing RAM to cache I&#x2F;O, but couldn&#x27;t spare a drop for programs?  ...I could go on, but simply put, RHEL6 was garbage.  And really I mean the RHEL6 kernels and the way that Red Hat tweaked whatever they did for it.<p>RHEL7 was a little better, but still seeing echoes of the ugliness of RHEL6.  RHEL5 was just a faded pleasant dream.<p>The last 3 Fedoras on the other hand, the memory management seems like we&#x27;re finally digging ourselves out of the nightmare.

Three, it pointed out impersonators of BS because they would not call each other f@%%ot, thus helping to mitigate the spread of false information.

All this takes effort and care, but well worth it to me.

Ultimately I keep a list of the stuff I need to do and manually do a lot of it.<p>An alternative which I have dabbled with is basing your config in VMs. Keep stable backups of them. That way the host OS is not important, and just re-use the VMs if you switch hosts. QubesOS is what really opened my eyes to this. Of course this is really only useful for particular workflows probably more development oriented, and at some point you&#x27;ll want to update them&#x2F;start fresh."

The usable solution would be non-trivial, what should I hear after running <i>make -j</i>? There could have been a commands  like &quot;give me the first five warnings&quot;, &quot;navigate to the first warning&quot;.<p>Blindfolded navigation in the code tree would also be interesting. I could say commands like &quot;list modules with route handlers&quot;, &quot;go to function X&quot;, &quot;get the type signature&quot;, &quot;summarize function&quot;.<p>If the sane audible feedback would be feasible, it&#x27;d open a door into coding for people with visual impairments, or coding while wandering around, or pushing commits with a headset from the beach."

The preponderance of C# and Java in the enterprise world, and C++ in games.  These weren&#x27;t accidents of history.  Without mandatory compile-time type-checking, re-factoring eventually becomes so perilous that it is avoided, and the product withers.  Why they chose that in a &quot;robustness&quot; language is a head-scratcher.<p>Also, the compiler is slow--which wouldn&#x27;t be so bad if it caught more errors (like type mismatches), but it doesn&#x27;t."

"America has cycled back and forth between retributory “justice” (punishment and “law enforcement officers”) and reformatory (penitentiaries and “peace officers”). Currently it’s in the most destructive of the first modes, and seems anchored there by being coupled to a private sector lobby and a propaganda of violence.<p>But history has shown it could cycle back to more practical state, as exemplified by Judge Cicconetti. It doesn’t even require mushy idealism: a practical view of achieving the cheapest outcome shows that “hammer and tongs” doesn’t work."
"This article strikes me as extraploating a select few experiences to make far reaching conclusions. 99% of the people at yale are not children of billionaires or statesmen. They are children of doctors, lawyers, programmers, etc. who are wealthy but not wealthy enough to live off their inheritance indefinitely. People attend classes, do research, play sports, or put up performances - in short what&#x27;s been going on for decades at virtually every college. Maybe there&#x27;s a larger structural inequality problem in society, but it seems far fetched to point to her anecdotal experiences with rich kids as the cause."

"It seems like Google is de-ranking independent websites, rather than actually analyzing whether a website provides good information or not.<p>I&#x27;m not sure that this is happening intentionally - it&#x27;s probably way more difficult to figure out a way to automate a &quot;quality of information&quot; rating, rather than just prioritizing websites for companies that make lots of money.<p>However, this has the unintended effect of narrowing the overton window for &quot;acceptable&quot; opinions.

"At my work, we use Teams a fair bit, and I&#x27;ll go out on the limb to defend it (a limb I&#x27;m quite familiar with at this point ;) ). Thinking of it as a Slack alternative is, IMO, the wrong starting point. We barely use it for chat (as we have Slack as well). Instead, we use it as a file share and central information home. Each group within a team has a channel and we use the tabs to track meeting notes, embed external calendars, and more.<p>And importantly, we use it for file sharing. Each channel is a root point for a team-specific folder. This is helpful because storing common docs there means they are perpetually available to collaborators, as opposed to OneDrive storage, which in my experience has been very hit or miss (sahre links expiring, etc. ). People can trust that team content is there.<p>There are downsides. It took me a few months to find my &#x27;optimal&#x27; usage pattern, I can&#x27;t have channel-specific sharing, and it takes me a while to explain the above to people on the team. It is far from perfect, but it is better than sharing a bunch of files in email threads or maintaining unofficial google docs in a Microsoft world."

The touchscreens that are allowed to be used are not cheap and if the display breaks, it must all be replaced. The whole monitor itself is the smallest replaceable unit.

Those of us who knew the manager were aghast and assumed the grad would be in for a bit of a tough time.  But the GM just smiled and said &quot;of course, hope it compiles OK&quot;, went away, and came back later.<p>That moment has stuck with me throughout my career.  I&#x27;ve sought to emulate that level of humility and respect.  Can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve always been successful, but it remains inspirational."
"&gt; By activating a dormant software lock on their newest iPhones, Apple is effectively announcing a drastic new policy: only Apple batteries can go in iPhones, and only they can install them.<p>I really dislike the phrasing attached to this story.<p>It&#x27;s not a lock: a third party installed battery still <i>works</i>, the phone isn&#x27;t refusing to start up until you go to an Apple Store and have an authentic Apple(tm) battery installed. Rather, it&#x27;s a warning in the &quot;battery health&quot; section basically saying &quot;we don&#x27;t know if your battery is any good, you might need to get it replaced&quot;.<p>That said, I&#x27;d prefer a clearer phrasing of their error message. It looks like it&#x27;s just triggering the generic &quot;your battery may need service&quot; warning, which is more of a scare tactic than I&#x27;d like. &quot;You don&#x27;t have a certified Apple battery&quot; would be completely sufficient.<p>Given the existence of refurbishment scams, where substandard parts are put into old phones to make them look good briefly, I can understand where Apple is coming from on this point. Someone who buys a second-hand iPhone and finds the battery dies after a month isn&#x27;t going to be very happy with iPhones."
"Article gets the perspective completely wrong. A space has meaning because a mind interacts with it. If you see the player as the only mind in a single-player game, then go make design hurdles and obstacles like an olympic sport. But videogames can have fake AI minds.<p>If you design a room from the perspective of a dog that needs to maximize it&#x27;s needs&#x2F;wants&#x2F;goals&#x2F;skill&#x2F;desire, from the perspective of it&#x27;s mind, then designing terrain so that the dog can pursue those goals in a way that is fun for the player and for &quot;the dog&quot; is much more intuitive. The only conflict you need to focus on is the intersection between the dog&#x27;s goals and the player&#x27;s story-line through the world.<p>Presuming your game is based on combat, then designing the space so the dog can maximize (or just play) with it&#x27;s abilities and perceptions in a fight and making the room play in fun way becomes more straight forward. You look at the room you are building from the perspective of 4 paws on the floor and build a nice overhang or a cheekily placed box so that when the dog breaks it&#x27;s normal goals to pursue the player, the most common response from the player (look at it, or whatever) will be intersected or guided by a fun piece of world matter.<p>There is nearly no meaning in his world, it exists only to express the skill of playing a game with no minds, so an emphasis on map control and resources control becomes more important than interacting with a meaningful behaviour the game actors produce."

"So my family actually knew the sheriff from the next county over.  He picked up McElroy a couple times for various things. (I think being drunk etc.).  Now when this was explained, this was 26-27 years ago, so my memory is a little fuzzy, but he explained that the man was a monster of an individual.  (like huge.)  The guy could pick up a hog from the other side of the fence and just walk off with it.  Dead lifting a few hundred pounds, that&#x27;s hard, and really scary to think someone can do that who doesn&#x27;t like you.  You don&#x27;t cross an individual like that lightly.<p>You have to remember this was 35+ years ago when this all happened.  Things aren&#x27;t what they used to be now. People didn&#x27;t make long distance calls back then, because it was too expensive.  You lived out it in the middle of nowhere especially back then, you&#x27;re on your own.  No one is coming to help you if you&#x27;re in serious trouble.  My parents had this joke.  They said the fire department had a perfect record around where we were.  They hadn&#x27;t saved a house yet.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong, they really respected the firemen.  The point was that when you live 20+ miles away from the fire station, there is no possible way they are going to save the house in time. There was no GPS, and 911 had only been invented a little over a decade before.  A lot of people didn&#x27;t even own phones.<p>It&#x27;s easy to talk about the rule of law, and how they should let the justice system work it out, but it&#x27;s a different kind of law in those parts.

The kind you don&#x27;t want.  Evidence gets &quot;lost&quot;, etc.  A lot of times it was (and still is in certain places) easier to just keep your mouth shut and move on.  I&#x27;m not saying I agree with what they did, and I wasn&#x27;t in their position, so I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;d do.  I can sure see why they thought that was the only recourse they had though."

"Actually, I was just thinking of something like this. In particular, I&#x27;d like to be able to keep tabs on a group of YouTube creators, without being dependent on the whims and machinations of what the YouTube team wants to promote.

"This move excites me a lot. Tumblr isn&#x27;t really about &quot;brands&quot; (in spite of what Oath would&#x27;ve wanted you to believe)— it&#x27;s a lot of things, but at the end of the day, at it&#x27;s core, it&#x27;s a blogging platform.<p>IMO it had a lot of potential in the late 2000s but the execution just wasn&#x27;t there, and I have a few theories why that could&#x27;ve been:<p>- Cost of revenue. Tumblr was pretty media-heavy from the start (vs Twitter for example, which started as short snippets of text, reddit which didn&#x27;t host its own images&#x2F;video until much later, etc). The cost of this, per user, was probably huge. Moreover, they had to power things like custom themes, custom sub-domains, 7 different kinds of posts, etc. That doesn&#x27;t sound cheap.<p>- Location. It matters a lot, and growing a company like this in NYC was probably harder, especially at the time, then it would&#x27;ve been in SF or the bay. Be this in terms of getting the right engineers, investors, managers, etc.<p>- Ambition. I&#x27;ve heard from a reliable source that David Karp, originally, simply didn&#x27;t want Tumblr to grow huge and become this behemoth of a tech company. He kept it at about a dozen engineers for as long as he could, and even when the company started growing more, he doesn&#x27;t seem to be an empire-building entrepreneur like Mark Zuckerberg or Bill Gates. Now that he&#x27;s out of Tumblr, he&#x27;s fallen completely off the radar. I doubt he will build anything else. He&#x27;s got the money he needs, so it wouldn&#x27;t surprise me if he just retires.<p>I think it had, at one point, the potential to compete with the likes of Instagram and VSCO for the younger creative demographic (Can&#x27;t beat Tumblr&#x27;s customizability, and some themes make great portfolios). Or with twitter as a place to post random thoughts and follow celebrities (Taylor Swift, afaik, still uses Tumblr. Tumblr invented reblogs before Titter invented retweets afaik). Or with Snapchat and the like for the younger demographic who likes privacy and anonymous features (it had an anonymous question&#x2F;answer feature before tbh, a company since acquired by Facebook).<p>But it didn&#x27;t happen.<p>At this point, I don&#x27;t think it makes sense for them to even try to make it happen. Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, etc. They&#x27;re here to stay as the primary players in their respective markets. The space where I feel there&#x27;s still room for Tumblr to shine is back in its core competency, which is the fully customizable &quot;personal site&quot;.<p>The fact you can follow Tumblr sites and be followed is icing on top of the cake but not a core competency to be leveraged because the feed market is crowded with all the aforementioned players. The fact you can take any content, and publish it on the web in any format you want (thanks to how highly customizable Tumblr profiles are) is amazing and should be the primary focus.<p>Essentially, Tumblr cannot compete in feeds, but it can compete in profiles and use its feed as a killer added benefit.<p>Let&#x27;s look at what Automattic has achieved with WordPress. It offers you a fully-customizable site, to post your content, and _a third_ of the top 10 million sites (by Alexa ranking) are using it [1]. What I want to see is WordPress building up Tumblr to be like this— an option for people looking to set up websites.<p>Square just bought Weebly for $365 million, and it accounts, at the moment, for 0.4% of the top 10 million CMSes [1]. The space for small-shop online commerce is evidently valuable.<p>Lets say WordPress pitches Tumblr as a competitor to Squarespace or Weebly in the e-commerce field. It&#x27;s already-existing social features could boost the value of its commerce features considerably. Maybe as a competitor to Squarespace or Behance in the personal-portfolio field. Again, its already existing feed could have amazing added value. As a creative I&#x27;d consider it over Behance right away for exposure. If you were an artist, would you prefer a SoundCloud that also allows you to set up a personal music site, complete with custom url, online shop, cool looks, etc? Imagine a writing and discovery experience that is as good or better than Medium, but you can customize the front page of publication to not look anything like medium.<p>Long-term, and if they align the protocols, Tumblr could become a follow button for the web. But first it has to become a larger part of the web and this is where Automattic I think can really excel with Tumblr.<p>I&#x27;m very excited.<p>[1]: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;w3techs.com&#x2F;technologies&#x2F;overview&#x2F;content_management&#x2F;all&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;w3techs.com&#x2F;technologies&#x2F;overview&#x2F;content_management...</a>"

But it does not in Europe.

"When getting into a project, I usually work with someone in the hardware design space (I can do larger electronics myself and thus prototypes, but I&#x27;m hired for very small circuit projects) and after creating a prototype, we usually start searching for the the cheapest MCU (and other components) that fit the project. Spending a lot of time doing assembly and making it fit the constrained memory <i>will</i> pay off when doing million factory runs. A lot of MCU&#x27;s I work with are faster (or only marginally slower) than my beloved Z80 I grew up with an programmed many years, but usually have less (sometimes far less) memory.

But even a 50W panel, at $1.32 per watt, would have cost $66.<p>I&#x27;m hoping for the day where we can print solar panels as cheaply as we print paper."
