They&#x27;ve taken greed into stellar territory! Well done...
Is that first-order approximation appropriate for iteratively solving the Diff EQ?  Or does a higher order method such as Runge-Kutta have to be used?  I notice the graphs don&#x27;t align perfectly...

"Not surprising.  As someone who grew up in rural and suburban environments, big cities feel intensely depressing.  I go there and nothing I look at makes me feel happy.  I&#x27;m sure people who grew up there feel differently and see things I don&#x27;t see, but for me Manhattan feels as dead as the surface of Mars."
"I have a question for those with a better understanding of such things. Is it difficult to calculate time or memory  complexity of a function through static analysis?<p>It seems kind of basic, but I still find myself manually checking code instead of relying on a tool."

"If I saw both <i>Mark the surgical site</i> and <i>Introduce yourself by name</i> on the list, I would also be suspicious about which items were saving lives and which were wasting my time.<p>Separately, maybe it would work better to give the checklist to the patient and have her check off the items.<p>In light of some comments, it appears I wasn&#x27;t clear.  My point was that the problem is having BOTH those items on the list.  Marking the surgical site is definitely worthwhile.  Having it on the same checklist as introducing yourself dilutes the importance of it and the other important items on the list."
This might be the nerdiest article I&#x27;ve seen.<p>Also a great illustration why CoinJoin is not a complete transaction privacy solution for Bitcoin.

"Speaking as someone who has been at Google for about 10 years, I would caution against trying to paint &quot;developers at Google&quot; using broad strokes. Google is a multifaceted megacorporation housing a plethora software project categories. Through the years I&#x27;ve been deeply involved in a wide spectrum of them, ranging from &quot;disconnect for 6 solid months and deliver a leapfrog for the masses&quot; to &quot;form an umbilical cord with a handful of enterprise customers.&quot; The techniques necessary to drive results in each case vary in accordance with the nature of the problem. This is where broad perspective and good judgement come into play, and dogmatic adherence to -- or dogmatic rejection of -- any particular development process presents a risk."

"Similarly, there are many annoying Linux bugs:<p>`pthread_create` can sometimes return back a garbage thread value or crash your program entirely without any way to catch it or detect it [1]. High speed threadding is hard enough as it is, without the kernel acting non-deterministically.<p>Un-killable processes after copy failure (D or S state) [2]. If the kernel is completely unable to recover from this failure, is it really best to make the process hang forever, where your only available option is to restart the machine? I ran into this with a copy onto a network drive with a spotty connection, that actual file itself really didn&#x27;t matter - but there was no way to tell the kernel this.<p>Out Of Memory (OOM) &quot;randomly&quot; kills off processes without warning [3]. There doesn&#x27;t appear to be a way to mark something as low-priority or high-priority and if you have a few things running, it&#x27;s just &quot;random&quot; what you end up losing. From a software writing stand-point this is frustrating to say the least and makes recovery very difficult - who restarts who and how do you tell why the other process is down?<p>[1] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;linux.die.net&#x2F;man&#x2F;3&#x2F;pthread_create"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;linux.die.net&#x2F;man&#x2F;3&#x2F;pthread_create</a><p>[2] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;superuser.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;539920&#x2F;cant-kill-a-sleeping-process&#x2F;541493#541493"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;superuser.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;539920&#x2F;cant-kill-a-sleeping-...</a><p>[3] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;serverfault.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;84766&#x2F;how-to-know-the-cause-of-a-oom-error-on-linux"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;serverfault.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;84766&#x2F;how-to-know-the-caus...</a>"

"When I do dev stuff with a slight sense of urgency, the probability of my mind wandering somewhere else goes down drastically.<p>At this mode, my mind uses all available time slots to make the best of them.

"Instead of solving their customers&#x27; problems immediately, they have a computer analyze the tone of your voice and decide whether or not you really need to be helped. We&#x27;re one step closer to life being a &quot;simulation&quot; where very little that is real matters. Your position as a customer and customer service&#x27;s position as an agent are irrelevant, what matters is whether or not the computer has decided you are worth helping (until then, the agent &quot;cannot&quot; help you).<p>I think the worst part is, people will adapt and start to treat customer service with more anger, as they&#x27;ll learn it solves their problems more frequently. Some of them will take this behavior out into meatspace instead of just doing it over the phone.

"Several years ago I did want to fix something in Firefox, and it was far easier to just patch a few bytes in the binary (I think it might&#x27;ve been a string constant) than go through the whole build process with all the resources that takes, including trying to find where in the original source to actually make the change, and then still have a totally different binary than the one you wanted to fix, with other (bug-causing) changes you <i>didn&#x27;t</i> want due to the different environment you built it in.<p>Of course, if you try to fix&#x2F;revert something that was purposely broken or removed for some Mozilla reason, it is not going to accept your changes either.<p>One of the ideals of open-source was to make it easy to modify and share software. For a lot of the larger projects, I feel like that has missed the mark. I write (mostly small and always portable) software, yet the &quot;build bloat&quot; is a huge turn-off. On the other hand, I&#x27;ve had good experience with the smaller open-source projects, those that need a minimal amount of tooling and resources to build. Some examples I can think of include libpng, zlib, and even OpenSSL."

"Cassettes were also the first and last audio storage medium where mainstream consumers could purchase an affordable, ready-made appliance for home listening that could also act as an audio editing system, recording the result onto another cassette. This is what enabled mixtapes.<p>With formats that came later, CD-recording remained expensive until personal computers were becoming widespread, and while CDs could be ripped or mp3s could be remixed on computers, you needed software that was often commercial and rarely included.<p>Digital audio then de-emphasized removable storage, re-introducing friction between exchanging music and listening to it on a portable player. Nowadays, most music exchange happens online, but the appeal of exchanging music in person endures even for generations that grew up with the Internet.<p>Cassettes had excellent usability for sharing: ease of duplication, ease of remixing, more rugged than vinyl, easier to hold than CDs, and maintaining its playback position at rest [1]. Couple that with authentic nostalgia, or yearning for an aesthetic and mood of times past. While the vinyl revival is centered around the deliberate experience of browsing, playback, and large-size album art, like enjoying an artisanal product made by skilled craftsmen, cassette revival celebrates the versatility of the format, its lack of restrictions, the opportunities for creativity, and its physicality on a very human scale.<p>[1] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=20332150"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=20332150</a>"

"Its really really to hard differentiate yourself as an ISP as most people look to you as utility and ultimately just look at your price. There are in my experience (see below) two ways to measure&#x2F;review an ISP:
1) Their customer service.
2) Their actual internet product (be it fibre, lte or copper)<p>Most people get upset,mad and angry when 1(customer service) goes wrong and thus grade the ISP solely on that. They then move to a &quot;better&quot; (read better call centre agent) and usually for a less superior product.<p>Face-it the &quot;Unicorn-ISP&quot; doesn&#x27;t exist with excellent customer service and excellent connectivity product.<p>Fun side-story&#x2F;plug.

Keep in mind only about 10%-15% of our population have fibre-coverage.<p>Our biggest problem is most people still don&#x27;t know how fibre works in our country. I.e you can only get a package from an ISP with a network you have coverage for.<p>I&#x27;ve once be called &quot;unethical&quot; because I told a lady she can ONLY get fibre from this very specific fibre network in her area.

"I think Perl was fighting on too many fronts at the turn of the century: web, systems automation, data processing, science and a few more. Today these areas are better covered by other languages that have hefty internet buzz and corporate support behind.<p>Perl also has no shiny features. It&#x27;s just extremely dynamic and paradigm agnostic, great at shell interactions and natural at text processing (specially with regexes), good enough at binding C&#x2F;C++ libraries, has package management built-in (CPAN) and an automated testing culture. Perl basically set the baseline for a lot of today&#x27;s languages.<p>Perl5 devs put a lot of focus on making Perl even more dynamic during the 2000s, relying on CPAN&#x2F;community to fix language quirks and plug in novelties. It worked to some extent, Perl got to the point where it could be written like Haskell, Ruby... During that time it also got a powerful but optional class system (Moose) and reinvented itself as a web language (Mojolicious, Plack).<p>Unfortunately it all came too late, most Perl5 devs moved to something else or maintained Perl5 code frozen in legacy mode. Fewer and fewer started new projects using Perl. For instance, nowadays I tend to pick a language&#x2F;ecosystem pair based on these concerns first depending on what the job requires:<p>- asynchronous event processing, specially network related -- I pick JavaScript&#x2F;Node.<p>- real parallel processing and highly performant systems, I&#x27;d use Go.<p>- &quot;we got a package for that&quot; -- Python or JS at the forefront here. It depends on what package I&#x27;ll need for the job, typically it&#x27;s not going to be in CPAN.<p>- great code reuse&#x2F;portability -- to me JS wins here. And still the only single language for both server and browser.<p>- compiled hard-packaged binaries: Go, but also Rust, Elixir, Nim, and others can fit the bill.<p>- code style and paradigm -- a very personal choice, I think Typescript and ES2019 are both great here. Golang and others are also great if I feel like staying away away from OO.<p>Perl would have a hard time competing in any of these fronts, but it still is one of the greatest for practical extraction and reporting, text or database wise and easily available or pre-installed on many servers out there new and old."

"I completely agree that funding will change dramatically in the next few years, and that the phenotype of founders will change.  YC is doing a lot of awesome things to lead this change.<p>Historically, most $10B+ biotherapeutics companies were started by young technical founders, but most VCs today start companies in house, then hire older, non technical execs from big pharma to run the companies.  Most of these companies are built to sell, and will never be lasting companies.  I wrote several articles on this [0], [1], [2], [3]<p>This model is poorly suited for companies based on innovative platform tech.  Technical founders (biologists, bioengineers) are the right people for these companies.  In this way, biotech is very much like the tech startup world pre-YC<p>However, I don&#x27;t necessarily agree that the world is changing because starting a biotech company is getting cheaper.  And I don&#x27;t think the traditional tech funding model is right for biotech.<p>The biggest risk in biotech is that stuff that works in mice doesn&#x27;t work in people.  You need to filter out false positives early on to avoid spending $200M getting a drug that wont likely work to Phase 2.  It is better to spend $2M properly vetting the science than it is to go cheap and fast and cut corners.  The reason biotech VCs have done so well the last 10 years is that they are really good at finding bad science quickly.  The mentality of &quot;spend as little money as possible to quickly generate positive data to raise more money&quot; is the mindset that leads to the reproducibility crisis in academia and, in extreme cases, to companies like theranos<p>Starting a biotech company is cheaper, but it has been cheaper for a while.  The big change now is that biotech companies can get bigger because scientific innovations are letting us develop better medicines faster with higher probability of success.  10 years ago, it was unlikely for a biotherapeutics startup to exit for over $500M.  Now we see dozens of $1b+ exits a year<p>Companies are getting bigger, and they are getting big faster.  Kite, Juno and Avexis (gene and cell therapy leaders) reached $8-10B valuations faster than SpaceX, Twitter, Pinterest and Dropbox.<p>It is now possible to power law invest in biotech, which was impossible 10 years ago when you had to get venture returns for a fund in a world where the best exit you could hope for was $500M.  In that world, VCs have to get consistent singles and doubles: low risk, low valuations.

There&#x27;s no justification for that. However, the lead is the lead is the lead, and it&#x27;s burried."
"Sorry to be that guy, but fullstory, google tagmanager, and hotjar all on the same page, without any indication to the user that their every move is being tracked. This site is not too GDPR compatible.<p>Also, I&#x27;m working on something similar, but from a different perspective. My problem with this is that you have to design your website in Sketch, then turn it into code with a different service potentially waiting hours until you&#x27;ll see the end result.<p>So my idea is that I can build an app where you can basically draw the page elements, similarly to how you&#x27;d do it in Sketch, and it automagically turns the whole thing into a responsive website right away (no position:absolute hacks involved). I still have a lot to do though... :D"

"She forgets that the Amazon marketplace is made up of sellers and the prices aren&#x27;t controlled by Amazon for a lot of their products. These are inherited from the distributor in most cases. Sure Amazon fulfills the orders but it&#x27;s not like Walmart that controls the entire process. There is more freedom in Amazon.<p>Anyways, this is just the hip thing of today. How about making a service better than Amazon? No that&#x27;s impossible?? Well you can bet there are a million people trying right now so there are and will be plenty more alternatives."
"OK, but where does it stop now?"
Everyone&#x27;s seemed to gloss over this but this deal seems to be as much an acqhuisition as an acquisition. Do some research on who Gokul Rajaram is. He ran ads at FB and Google was a very significant leader. I don&#x27;t think the margins of food delivery have changed. Remember Square couldn&#x27;t get Uber to pick up Caviar for $100 million around the time Square had its IPO. Also I imagine the price involves DoorDash seems to be banking on a closer relationship with Square as well.

"For everyone complaining about peer review, another alternative to open review is paid reviewers who focus on a particular topic. For example, I&#x27;m an editor at a journal where statistical reviewers are paid and evaluated, while the remaining (content) reviewers are not. This ensures that we have a rigorous review of the statistical methods, at least. I do think payment increases the reviewers&#x27; responsibility and conscientiousness, and the overall quality of the subsequent articles. (nb This probably has been tested somewhere.)<p>BUT - paid reviews are not feasible for many journals, especially open access&#x2F;low-cost journals where margins may be thin. (Conversely, Elsevier should be able to pay their reviewers in gold bullion, rather than taking advantage of the scientific community&#x27;s altruism, but that&#x27;s another conversation)."
This is of course good advice. It&#x27;s strange that anyone who is more than the greenest professional developer wouldn&#x27;t do this. Experimental feature flags is basic software development.

"I think we can all agree that we want to maximize the quality of our work, where quality is defined as how well our work satisfies our goal.

"People love to rail on HFT, but at this point, its really not that profitable. It&#x27;s just a reality of trading in the markets.

"This or similar type of lacing is practicioned in some Bondage suspensions.

I&#x27;d tend to expect Radeon for compute to do best at the very largest companies where the cost of optimizing everything for the workload is spread over running on a whole lot of hardware as opposed to using NVidia where there&#x27;s already going to be a library optimized for what you&#x27;re doing.
"Go and Rust are the latest languages I started to use. Neither is perfect, both are awesome, but more importantly, both are a step forward, both get a lot of things very right, and for the rest, most are at least acceptable. When I code, most of my frustrating moments come from underlying problems with cross compatibility, access to hardware, graphics, encodings, etc, which are rarely problems caused by languages themselves.<p>We are pretty new at this, we are still trying to figure out a lot of things. We are still experimenting a lot with many features. But step by step, new language after 
new language, we keep improving.<p>Trying to be realist tends to be a painful exercise, but in the case of programming languages, I think the situation is looking pretty good. There might be a billion paths left to explore, but at least the ones we are exploring are bringing something useful to the table. I hope we soon start writing articles titled &quot;the perfect languages and the exciting ways we are getting closer to them&quot;. The article was pretty good, by the way."

Magic is a simple idea with endless potential - one phone number that you can send a text message to 24&#x2F;7 and get anything you want, whenever you want it. Food, flowers, plane tickets, reservations, electronics, you name it. We fulfill these requests magically for our users by being a common interface to a growing network of national and international service providers. Most of our users use us on a regular basis to make their lives easier and to be more productive, but of course, we fulfill our share of crazy requests: meeting celebrities, skywriting, 1,000 gallons of seawater, helicopters, motorcycles...<p>But all of this is just the beginning.

"Has anyone heard of a scientific journal adopting a peer-replicated approach(only accept papers that peers can replicate)?

"Fascinating facts to learn of, but sites like this one and LiveScience tend to interject too much extra content that is unsubstantiated. Adding in the bit about Caesar coming in, when he wasn&#x27;t on his high horse for 150 years after these people died. Just because some general time period was 2,200 years ago, doesn&#x27;t mean there isn&#x27;t a significant gap between the ages. 150 years can change a lot. It&#x27;s the time between the age of slavery in the US to today.<p>Then the bisexual (&#x2F;poly?) suggestion and hedonistic remark. Citations or substantiation? Very unprofessional but I suppose these are online authors from no specific literary tradition. It was a Roman source that recorded a consort to a Celtic king that supposedly told Emperor Augustus&#x27;s wife, “we consort openly with the best of men. You allow yourselves to be debauched in secret by the vilest.” Which is the hedonist? I&#x27;m American, of now-distant European Celtic &amp; Germanic tribal extraction and while a non-expert, am knowledgeable enough in the subject to see when someone is interjecting their personal nonsense into an article."

"I&#x27;m a recent PhD graduate that focused heavily on publication and collected ~20 publications.  I think the situation with peer review is worse than discussed here.<p>Peer review:<p>1. dramatically reduces the pace of progress<p>2. exacerbates publication bias<p>3. creates a false sense of accomplishment<p>4. creates a false meritocracy<p>5. creates many perverse incentives<p>(3) and (4) unfortunately wrap into grant financing as well.  The merit of your research isn&#x27;t measured on its impact on the human condition, but on it&#x27;s &#x27;impact&#x27; factor (a measure derived from your publications).<p>The gatekeeper problem here is pernicious as well.  If you become a highly cited author your ability to get&#x2F;maintain financing improves.  You also become a gatekeeper as a peer reviewer.  Which means that you are now strongly incentivized to accept papers from people who cite your work or align themselves with you, and reject everything else.<p>What is absolutely amazing here, is that the peer review process is opaque.  It is my belief that if you knew who reviewed which papers you would quickly discover that mild to severe abuse of peer review is the norm, not action by a handful of bad actors.  This is because the entire academic reward system is wrapped into the process.  Getting your name on a big paper can have lifelong ramifications on your ability to get grants, start companies, do consulting work, etc.<p>Peer reviewers should probably get paid for the work.  If they don&#x27;t get paid then their incentive to do review must come from somewhere else, vague notions of improving the field don&#x27;t cut it.  Peer review should obviously be transparent.  Some people might be uncomfortable signing their name to a paper rejection, but its time to get over that.  A small payment might help reviewers overcome this discomfort. It is bizarre that peer reviewers don&#x27;t get paid.  Peer review is valuable work if done right, and without payment all the reward of being a peer reviewer comes for the wrong reasons.<p>Finally, I agree with some other comments.  Publication should not be contingent on peer review, it should come first.  This would increase the pace of progress, reduce publication bias, reduce the false meritocracy, reduce the ability for bad actors to censor research, and more.  The cost would be a larger number of publications, but perhaps this would help people realize that many of the publications coming out right now are of little value.<p>Transparency is badly needed in many facets of academic research.  My company made a site that helps bring transparency into literature review (sysrev.com)."

"This article in Scientific American’s April 2019 [0] is an excellent article that introduced me some of the details of HIV treatment.<p>While it isn’t related to the primary focus of the parent article, it gives some useful context.<p>&gt;&gt; At the end of this first stage, the viral load stabilizes at a level that can, puzzlingly, last for many years. Doctors refer to this level as the set point. A patient who is untreated may survive for a decade with no HIV-related symptoms and no lab findings other than a persistent viral load and a low and slowly declining T cell count.<p>&gt;&gt; Eventually, however, the asymptomatic stage ends and AIDS sets in, marked by a further decrease in the T cell count and a sharp rise in the viral load. Once an untreated patient has full-blown AIDS, opportunistic infections, cancers and other complications usually cause the patient&#x27;s death within two to three years.<p>&gt;&gt; The key to the mystery was in the decade-long asymptomatic stage. What was going on then? Was HIV lying dormant in the body? Other viruses were known to hibernate like that. The genital herpesvirus, for example, hunkers down in nerve ganglia to evade the immune system. The chicken pox virus also does this, hiding out in nerve cells for years and sometimes awakening to cause shingles. For HIV, the reason for the latency was unknown.<p>...<p>&gt;&gt; When the researchers reran the experiment, fit the data to the model&#x27;s predictions and estimated its parameters again, they obtained results even more staggering than before: 10 billion virus particles were being produced and then cleared from the bloodstream each day. Moreover, they found that infected T cells lived only about two days. The surprisingly short life span added another piece to the puzzle, given that T cell depletion is the hallmark of HIV infection and AIDS.<p>&gt;&gt; The discovery that HIV replication was so astonishingly rapid changed the way that doctors treated their HIV-positive patients. Previously physicians waited until HIV emerged from its supposed hibernation before they prescribed antiviral drugs. The idea was to conserve forces until the patient&#x27;s immune system really needed help because the virus would often become resistant to the drugs. So it was generally thought wiser to wait until patients were far along in their illness.<p>&gt;&gt; Ho and Perelson turned this picture upside down. There was no hibernation. HIV and the body were locked in a pitched struggle every second of every day, and the immune system needed all the help it could get and as soon as possible after the critical early period of infection. And now it was obvious why no single medication worked for very long. The virus replicated so rapidly and mutated so quickly, it could find a way to escape almost any therapeutic drug.<p>&gt;&gt; Perelson&#x27;s mathematics gave a quantitative estimate of how many drugs had to be used in combination to beat HIV down and keep it down. By taking into account the measured mutation rate of HIV, the size of its genome and the newly estimated number of virus particles that were produced daily, he demonstrated mathematically that HIV was generating every possible mutation at every base in its genome many times a day. Because even a single mutation could confer drug resistance, there was little hope of success with single-drug therapy. Two drugs given at the same time would stand a better chance of working, but Perelson&#x27;s calculations showed that a sizable fraction of all possible double mutations also occurred each day. Three drugs in combination, however, would be hard for the HIV virus to overcome. The math suggested that the odds were something like 10 million to one against HIV being able to undergo the necessary three simultaneous mutations to escape triple-combination therapy.<p>&gt;&gt; When Ho and his colleagues tested a three-drug cocktail on HIV-infected patients in clinical studies in 1996, the results were remarkable. The level of virus in the blood dropped about 100-fold in two weeks. Over the next month it became undetectable.<p>[0] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;scientificamerican.express.pugpig.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;03&#x2F;13&#x2F;how-calculus-was-the-unsung-hero-in-the-fight-against-hiv&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;scientificamerican.express.pugpig.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;03&#x2F;13&#x2F;how...</a>"

"The article uses a simplified version of Scheme as a toy Lisp, for an exercise, which is an excellent choice, but a downside is that it could be misinterpreted as characterizing Scheme well.<p>First, there&#x27;s what I think is an important distinction of idiomatic programming in Scheme, for which the first example in the article gives the wrong idea, with a noble lie: that Java code implies an immediate return, but the Scheme code does not.<p>Were that Scheme expression not in a tail position of a procedure (which it probably wouldn&#x27;t be), it wouldn&#x27;t have effect analogous to that of the Java code.  And a one-armed `if` makes little sense in a tail position in modern Scheme, and looks erroneous.<p>Scheme is a full imperative algorithmic language, and doesn&#x27;t have to be used in a pure-functional way, but idiomatic programming in Scheme tends to lean towards functional when practical.  You almost never do premature returns quite like that in Scheme, for example.  (One <i>can</i> do most any memory-safe thing one wants, including the less-idiomatic and even the outrageously insane, but hopefully over time one learns the idiomatic ways, rather than overuses&#x2F;misuses less-idiomatic features, like leaning on a crutch they don&#x27;t need and that&#x27;s actually harmful to them.)<p>Separate from that, another thing possibly misleading about this article is that their Scheme implementation doesn&#x27;t do what&#x27;s sometimes called &quot;proper implementation of tail calls&quot; (which would be required to be a real Scheme).  Idiomatic Scheme will tend to use tail calls heavily, with impunity, which would not be the case if a Scheme implementation let such calls exhaust resources."

"Most of you who attack doctors have no idea how this complex health care system works. Doctors are UNDERpaid. A majority of the billing goes to overhead for the hospital facilities, nurses, labs, meds, administrators, etc, with doctors getting much less than 10% of the revenue even though they are responsible for generating most of it. Your resident doctor friend (who has way more qualifications than your software engineer friend - including top tier college, and medical school) gets paid about 60-70k a year for working at least 80 hours a week. Yes, the man or woman who assists in your brain surgery after your aneurysm popped gets paid less than your uber driver for 7 years time, and he sacrificed his&#x2F;her best years to be a sleep deprived medical student and then brain surgeon working under constant rush and stress, as their 300k med school debt accumulated under high compound interest. Meanwhile, your mediocre software engineer friend graduates debt free, gets paid 160k out of college to build the next best sexting app, at a company with free lunch and gym.<p>Also, don&#x27;t forget about the malpractices. 10 years down the line, your radiologist friend gets successfully sued for 11 million dollars bc the parents of a child for whom they read a chest radiograph decided to sue because lawyer convinced the parent and jury that radiologist was at fault for not saying the heart is enlarged and somehow that is responsible for all the kids ailments later on in life (the truth is much more complex than that). The radiologist probably got paid 7.50$ for that read, btw. This is actually a true story, look it up in the Boston Globe. Now all providers are on edge and overdiagnosing and overordering everything - who would want to miss a diagnosis."

being able to say, eg:<p><pre><code>  $data = &quot;foobarfoo&quot;;

"Filthstep didn&#x27;t sound anything like what I was expecting. But I didn&#x27;t really <i>know</i> what to expect.

Schranz: maybe that&#x27;s the intro of a track that eventually meanders into schranz, but the clip on hand is way off. Swedish pop: pretty good. Glitch hop: no way. Gospel singers: US centric, but OK. Nigerian Hip Hop: yeah that&#x27;s sort of valid in the sense that 2Baba is a Nigerian hip hop producer, but that sample is neither especially Nigerian nor particularly hippy-hoppy. Electro swing: all thumbs up. Bury St Edmunds Indie: A truly sublime blend of Sudbury angst and Lavenham melancholy, virtouosly caramelised in Ipswich je-ne-sais-quoi.

Helmut Kohl of the CDU (conservative party) turned back a decision of his predecessor to role out a fiber network across Germany that would have been constructed from the 80ies until the millenium [1]. Germany could have had fiber to the home for 20 years at the least reachable areas and for 35 in major cities.<p>Rumor has it that nowadays, Telekom is postponing fiber because they don&#x27;t want to sublicense their network to other carriers so they wait until they are getting a better deal.

"I really wish we would curb this kind of behavior.  Even if this speed is related to the brokerage business and not HFT, it is unfair to retail investors that large businesses have better market access.  My solution: exchanges are required by law to process contracts in pulses with strict execution ordering rules.  E.g., every 15 seconds process all buy and sells, processing from highest bid and lowest ask first for each security.  Basically a turn-based stock market."

I love how everybody is having a cow over a website where the rhetoric isn&#x27;t really all that much worse than a &#x27;mainstream&#x27; site like twitter.

"I am really sick of the high horse that this company thinks they are on because of their pseudo-neutrality.<p>What should normally happen if you come across some criminal or reprensible content, is that it&#x27;s possible to figure out who owns the IP space,and if it&#x27;s not already a criminal organisation decide to aid the ISP in running a reputable business and send them an abuse notice. This has the effect that <i>bad</i> actors need to move to <i>bad</i> networks, which you can quarantine at your own network boundary - I get to make a decision as private citizen on what is allowed on my network.<p>That is a process that works.<p>Cloudflare obfuscates the real IP space, which means that the <i>best</i> outcome I can achieve from them is that they will <i>forward</i> my abuse complaint to possibly the mob, which is not a move I am willing to make.<p>In this way they are not just a DDOS protection service, they are business protection for criminals.

"It&#x27;s really <i>expensive</i> for companies, too. The company I work for (small to medium sized) has a 34&#x2F;34 Mbit&#x2F;s fiber connection and it costs us 600€ per month.

We simply cannot afford a 100&#x2F;100 MBit&#x2F;s connection and we are located in a larger city near the center, not even in a rural area that needs an extra fiber just for us.<p>So it doesn&#x27;t come as a surprise that German companies are so much behind Americans in the tech sector. My company has a lot of manufacturing customers and we don&#x27;t even need to think about a cloud strategy because most of them are still on 6&#x2F;0.6 MBit&#x2F;s DSL connections.

"Beyond opaque and variable pricing for the same service, there is also the question of whether something simpler would do the trick.<p>Some years ago, I thought I might have broken my finger. I went to the doctor and it was actually the physician&#x27;s assistant who saw me. I&#x27;d explained at the front desk that I had a high-deductible policy and I would be paying in full for the visit.<p>The PA said &quot;Usually we would send someone for an X-ray, but since your insurance won&#x27;t cover it, there is a quick test we could do and it would just be part of this office visit.&quot;<p>He opened a drawer and pulled out an instrument and asked me if I knew what it was. Being a musician, I said &quot;Yeah, that&#x27;s a big tuning fork. And with those weights on the end it must vibrate at a very low frequency.&quot;<p>He said, &quot;You got it! The idea is we get the fork vibrating and then hold the end against your finger. If it&#x27;s broken, it will hurt like the dickens, so just holler and we will stop and you go get that X-ray. If it doesn&#x27;t hurt much, it&#x27;s just a sprain, so take it easy and you should be fine.&quot;<p>We did it, and my finger was fine. Saved me a bunch of time and money!<p>Edit: Thank you everyone for the lively commentary! I would like to mention something that I forgot at first (it was ten years ago) and your comments reminded me of.<p>The PA didn&#x27;t pull out the tuning fork until going through a complete set of manual range-of-motion and &quot;does this hurt&quot; tests. All indications were that my finger was not broken, it was just a mild sprain. I&#x27;d only gone to the doctor in the first place out of the proverbial &quot;abundance of caution&quot;.<p>So it was <i>my</i> decision not to get the X-ray. Please, everyone, do not blame this on the American medical insurance system! I could have easily afforded the extra $150 for the X-ray, and of course I still had that option <i>after</i> the tuning fork test. But since both the PA and I were both so sure at this point that it was just a sprain, I figured I would same both time and money by skipping it.<p>It was my call how to proceed with this very minor injury, no one else&#x27;s."

"William Gaddis published his first novel (Recognitions) with 33, his next (JR) with 53, his third (Carpenter&#x27;s Gothic) with 63, his fourth (A Frolic of His Own) with 72, and his fifth and last (Agapē Agape) with 80.
That&#x27;s it.<p>He was one of the world best novelists. Good things need time.

"My view is that all programmers produce roughly the same amount of bugs per hour, it is just the bugs per feature which differ. Of course bad programmers can spend a lot of time fixing bugs as they go making the end result have few bugs, but still the main time-sink is fixing all of those bugs.<p>So to become fast, learn to write code which is very easy to verify that it works. If you get surprised when things work the first time you try then you are not fast."
"I think it&#x27;s high time for a full-blown FTC investigation into Yelp for restraint of trade, consumer fraud, false advertising, and whatever else the FTC can think of. These parasites have outlived their usefulness.<p>Failing that, a high-profile class-action lawsuit might get their attention."
"I think that like any category of evaluation, it works best if it&#x27;s specific, consistent, and planned.<p>Eg &quot;Part of our culture is that we are collaborative; when we discussed code reviews and the candidate said they think they are a waste of time, that raised a flag because constructive and timely code reviews is an expectation for all our our engineers&quot; That&#x27;s pretty good.<p>&quot;Our culture is collaborative. This candidate didn&#x27;t feel like they&#x27;d be a good fit here.&quot; That&#x27;s not so good.<p>Have an evaluation criteria going in. Rate candidates on the the same criteria. In debriefs, use specific examples from the interview to explain why you rated them as you did. Otherwise, it&#x27;s just post-hoc rationalization of a snap emotional decision."
It certainly is plausible that different cultures have different tendencies but this seems like it must be exaggerated somewhat for entertainment purposes because it almost paints French people as a bit of a caricature.<p>The specific example sounds like it could be a combination of a very small amount of language boundary and a slightly unhelpful or not particularly brilliant airline agent.<p>Anyway I&#x27;m interested to hear what French people think of this.

"I was leaning strongly towards AWS, after talking with people.  I find the business model very appealing, and it sounded like I&#x27;d probably be valued well there.<p>Then I did a little due-diligence searching of news articles and such that I vaguely recalled, about both the blue collar and white collar cultures, and was very disappointed.<p>The various stories about non-developer treatment seemed much closer to home and real, when I imagined working there, and feeling I probably wouldn&#x27;t be able to do anything to help them, and might be afraid to even try, unlike at some places.<p>I also didn&#x27;t like the idea of (reportedly) being stack-ranked, and having everyone&#x27;s metrics thrown up in a meeting, for a bunch of managers who excel in Amazon&#x27;s metrics-driven corporate culture to debate amongst themselves.  It sounded rougher than many other places.<p>Also, the noncompete.  It wasn&#x27;t in itself a showstopper for me, but it seemed to send a message of what the overall tone would be.<p>I&#x27;m not doing myself any favors by saying this, but I was actually disappointed, and maybe our industry will improve if we speak candidly about some corporate cultural things and values."
"That top rated answer is excellent.<p>Agile at its core, to me as an engineering manager, is:
- People over process&#x2F;tools
- Plan-able execution and pivoting quickly in rapidly changing environments
- Create consistent, repeatable work delivery
- Retrospection, learning and iteration over time
- Tools (can) support the process to multiply efficiency but do not solve the core goals and problems<p>Like the author of the comment said, the details of how you execute &quot;agile&quot; is where things get bumpy for teams."

"This has to be a &quot;worst nightmare&quot; for most people. I came across a guy a very long time ago who had been in a long term care unit after an auto accident for something like 15 years at that point. The story I was told, and I don&#x27;t know it&#x27;s veracity, is that he was resuscitated against his stated wishes and the hospital was paying for his care forever. His eyes would open but he didn&#x27;t respond in any way to any stimulus that I saw. He had a feeding tube if I recall, and breathed on his own without ventilator support. He was a swollen belly with stringy arms and legs as atrophy did it&#x27;s thing. The nurses moved him around to prevent ulcerations and tended to his &quot;survival&quot;. It was terribly disconcerting and I hope to god he wasn&#x27;t aware because that sounds like hell.<p>As @ggm mentioned the documents...everyone should get an advanced directive. Anyone can do it and you don&#x27;t have to have a reason, unlike a DNR which has more restrictions and requires a doctor&#x27;s approval.

Submt it for your medical record and keep a copy in your emergency papers. Unsure how much it would have helped the guy above as I don&#x27;t know the full story, but it&#x27;s easy to do and important to have.

"This might be an unpopular opinion for those who view more rules as the answer.<p>Banning (or discontinuing or deplatforming or whatever you want to call it) may do little but harden the resolve of key ideologues of whatever stripe. For them, it leads credence to the idea that there is conspiracy against the group afoot. Besides, when has banning actually been effective? Sure, it may reduce manifestation and reduce recruitment, but drugs and spam pretty much show wack-a-mole is not really an effective policy. That&#x27;s to say nothing of the moral hazards of thought police determining who can say what.<p>However it is obvious that leaving these kind of groups to echo chamber louder and more extreme, egging each other on also leads to bad outcomes.<p>Perhaps a solution may be proactive counter speech. Some sort of volunteer regiment or something that finds where these sorts congregate and offers counterpoints to violent idiocy. Obviously flat out threats or calls to action are crimes in and of themselves and should be treated as such.<p>This would be a pretty thankless task because who wants to deal with this type of idiocy and darkness all day? But I think it could be more effective if properly done than banning as far as changing minds and hearts, especially before people get sucked too far down echo chambers and start seeing the world in a way it really isn&#x27;t. Other people, smart people, articulate people, right there calling out wrongness, calling out stupidity, calling out misunderstanding, giving counterpoints, arguing for right action, this might be a more effective way to damp down the extremism."

"I&#x27;ll start by saying I agree with the premise of the article - transparency of pricing is not just helpful, it is necessary.<p>However...I can also understand why paying by cash should much cheaper Adding another company or companies into the transaction, trying to standardize the various medical procedures, invoicing and managing co-pays, deductibles etc adds a significant amount of overhead.<p>One would hope that the insurance companies would leverage the volume of transactions and the pools of clients to get price improvements but this is not the case."

"This is why cgroups were invented. They solve this problem. Start a process in its own cgroup, and you can later confidently kill the process and all of its descendants. Container &quot;technologies&quot; use cgroups extensively, as does systemd service management."
"So, in the documentation, &quot;all&quot; was very unclear.  Users guessed that &quot;all&quot; meant all in the company while it mean all in the whole world!<p>So, wildly ambiguous, unclear, dangerous product documentation.<p>Could clear that up by being really clear and explicit about &quot;all in the world&quot;, &quot;all in the company&quot;, &quot;all in a particular project&quot;, etc. and then lots of very clear examples.<p>But it was easier just to have some check box, icon, etc. described as &quot;all&quot;.<p>In current computing, such documentation nonsense is usually resolved by the usual way of making sense of a computer user interface, <i>experimentation</i>, or use the TIFO method (try it and find out), or throw the options and combinations of options over and over against a wall to see which ones appear to stick, or do the usual, my usual description, &quot;mud wrestling&quot;, all due to bad documentation.<p>It is as if the software were designed and written by people who thought that a check box with &quot;all&quot; was <i>all</i> there was to the work.<p>Well, in this case the TIFO experimentation involved hundreds of Fortune 500 companies and many other organizations, small to the largest, around the world.<p>It is as if the documentation writers were inarticulate and essentially illiterate.<p>So, Xerox PARC thought that some buttons, say, as on a microwave oven, would be sufficient for controlling lots of Xerox office machines.  Then the computer industry, with <i>graphical user interfaces</i> thought that nearly all of computing could also have such a user interface.  Nope:  Commonly even makers of microwave ovens have well written users guides.  The many millions of Web site user interfaces are generally much more complicated to control than a microwave oven and also need good <i>DOCUMENTATION</i>, e.g., much more then cryptic, not a chapter, paragraph, or sentence, not with examples, clear definitions, etc., but just a word or two from a <i>roll over</i>.  And often there is just an icon, can&#x27;t pronounce it, can&#x27;t spell it, can&#x27;t type it in text, can&#x27;t send it in e-mail,  can&#x27;t look it up in a dictionary or with a search engine -- which takes us back to pictographs before the Roman alphabet.  That situation, in technical language, is a bummer; more clearly a disaster as the OP shows.<p>IMHO, a good candidate for the biggest bottleneck in the future of computing is the quite general lack of good technical documentation.<p>E.g., two weeks ago I signed up with a different Internet access provider (ISP).  They promised me I could have up to five e-mail addresses.  Sooo, I tried to get a second address for the alpha test I plan for my project (Web site -- no icons!).  It took 14 hours of my time and nearly that much time with third level technical support.  With decent documentation, I could have done all the work in about 10 minutes.  But, three days ago their Internet service quit in my neighborhood.  Their efforts to reset my equipment (cable modem, IP router, WiFi connection) make my connection from before the outage work no longer.  The fix took a day and a half, about 30 hours of my time, and about 15 hours on their third and fourth level technical support.  With decent technical documentation, I could have fixed the problem myself in 10 minutes.  And I have MANY other such examples.  Several hours or days instead of a few minutes -- HUGE bottleneck to progress.<p>I say again:  One of the worst bottlenecks in the future of computing is the lack of decent technical documentation, in a natural language, e.g., English, and mostly in text.  No joke, guys. Icons, check boxes, radio buttons, text boxes, pull downs, pop ups, roll overs, etc., are NOT and can never be good natural language technical documentation.<p>TIFO on world-class issues is a huge disaster waiting to happen."

"There’s a trap in software dev careers. If you fall into it, you can really get stuck post 40.<p>If you work at a small-ish dev organization - especially in-house dev in a non-tech company - you can rise pretty far and become pretty senior, and your indispensability can net you a decent income. But on the open job market those skills don’t transfer as well. The senior roles in small dev shops are filled by promoting from within (because they value in house knowledge), and the senior roles in BIG dev shops are filled by hiring people who know how to operate in a big company, and you don’t have those skills.<p>Best way to avoid the trap is, try to work somewhere big for a bit before you get to 40, to keep that door open and make it possible to be hired into a senior role."

"Speaking as an automotive engine mechanic, sometimes we use lacing in long-haul tractor trailers.<p>Wiring for sensor modules along the air-slide fifth wheel, near the attic, or especially around the air brake dryer are always laced.  The reason for this is zip ties will quickly fail after freeze-thaw cycles.  professional drivers in wisconsin or Minnesota cannot get stuck due to an electrical failure on the side of a remote road, as it can prove fatal.<p>The same goes for heat.  sensors near the differential or aux transmission MUST be laced.  Climates like Arizona and Texas can cause zip ties to bite into soft wire insulation or vice versa, causing the harness failures.<p>Then theres manufacturer recommendations.  Zip tie plastic can contain additives that bugs or rodents find quite delicious, which cause nesting issues and failures.  kevlar twine or lacing cord can be dipped in bitrex or other chemicals to prevent this."

Part of my job was to keep these data files updated with info on a daily basis.<p>The problem with trying to edit these files was that everyone logged in on the network had access to them and could change them arbitrarily. Or they could even just inadvertently lock the files if they left them open on their PCs. There was no control or change management.<p>I decided to keep the &#x27;canonical&#x27; versions of the files on my PC at work and use Unison to sync them over to the shared network versions of the files once a day. Unison would instantly tell me if anyone other than me had changed the files, and I could investigate further. It was a huge relief knowing that I had proper control over those files."

"Ah, yes, that bug.<p>Few programs can handle a fail return from &quot;malloc&quot;, and Linux perhaps tries too hard to avoid forcing one. Most programs just aren&#x27;t very good at getting a &quot;no&quot; to &quot;give me more memory&quot; Browsers should be better at this, since they started using vast amounts of memory for each tab.<p>I used to hit a worse bug on servers. If you did lots of MySQL activity, so that many blocks of open files were in memory, and then started creating processes, you&#x27;d often hit a situation where the Linux kernel needed a page of memory but couldn&#x27;t evict a file block due to some lock being set. Crash. That was years ago; I hope it&#x27;s been fixed by now."

"I don&#x27;t see how mandating clear pricing is supposed to address medical inefficiency. If it threatens your life, you&#x27;re going to pay no matter what, or in other words, demand is inelastic. Insulin is often used as an example of an inelastic good in Economics 101. I&#x27;m not sure how people are supposed to comparison shop for hospitals in an emergency situation and even for elective procedures, lots of hospitals in an area are often owned by the same overarching company and it&#x27;s not difficult to collude. For &quot;the market&quot; to work, we would need to let people die, which is not very popular among society at large."
"The ray-scene hit test uses comparison between distances, which involves a square root for each sphere. If you switch to using squared distances, the comparison will work equally well and the code will be a lot faster in many cases. You will need to reorganize the code a bit, since the moment you actually find the hit, you may need to do the square root to calculate the actual distance (but it will only be once per pixel instead of once per pixel per object in the scene)."

"A helpful tip for finding a new job that uses technologies you don&#x27;t have professional experience with, but you want to learn...<p>Say you want to learn Rust, but all your experience is in Javascript. Most recruiters will immediately filter out your resume if you don&#x27;t have the keyword &quot;Rust&quot; somewhere in the document.<p>Before you start sending out your resume, spend a few weeks hacking on a Rust side project to learn some of the basics. Then on your resume, include a description at the top saying you&#x27;re proficient in Javascript, but want the opportunity to work in Rust. Then include a &quot;Side Projects&quot; section at the bottom that lists your Rust experience.<p>I&#x27;ve landed 3 jobs that way, where I&#x27;m hired for my experience with X, but under the condition I will have the opportunity to learn Y. Otherwise, it&#x27;s easy to get trapped working with the same tech at a new job, and your skills eventually become obsolete over time."
"Not exactly what he&#x27;s discussing, but similar in concept: I&#x27;ve noticed is that if you have a piece of code that needs to be split into two separate pieces and doesn&#x27;t have well defined interfaces, it&#x27;s often good to duplicate the code into two places, then slowly start cutting away at the redundant parts until you&#x27;ve diverged the pieces enough that they fulfill different roles.<p>It&#x27;s kinda like surgery. You can&#x27;t just rip open your patient, take out all their organs, then put them back after. You need to keep the patient alive. If you refactor but end up stuck halfway with a bunch of broken code, you either have to heroically finish the refactor and have it introduce minimal regressions and minimal issues or, more probably, you&#x27;ll run out of time&#x2F;people will get impatient and the refactor will be abandoned."
Your rates are higher than paying someone (offshore) to convert the artboards - why? Should be much cheaper if it&#x27;s automated.

"I think this is a great idea, like others said it&#x27;s the first time I&#x27;ve seen it. The problem is that almost any use case where this is useful for, is almost surely data that people wouldn&#x27;t want publicized. A self-hosted version of this is ideal (for businsesses). At the very least, allow for API tokens and require a login to see your output (for personal projects uses) instead of just relying on a short random string for security of output.

I think GDPR requires website owner to inform users what exactly is being processed and by who. The problem for website owners is that Facebook won&#x27;t really tell what data they process and who will they share it with or they do not seem to allow to revoke consent.

"I won&#x27;t deny many companies are playing this game of skimping as much as they can get away with, and I despise this practice. There&#x27;s also the other side of the fence though: customers who are just a resource drain.<p>I&#x27;ve recently been involved in some customer support efforts, and there are customers who are just unreasonable. They&#x27;ll demand to have their cake, eat it too, and even get a new one. For the nuisance that a completely made up problem caused them. A problem that wouldn&#x27;t even be your fault if it had been real.<p>They are a vast minority, but they spoil it for everyone. They consume your time and especially your team&#x27;s morale. There is only so much bullshit a support agent can take before getting fed up with it and degrading their service to subsequent customers.<p>Now the organization has to figure out a way to detect those customers early enough to prevent them from screwing up everything for everyone. But false positives are very expensive: get one wrong and it becomes a PR nightmare.<p>Furthermore, if you try to give the best possible support, you must empower your agents to act. They can now screw up and even get your company in legal trouble. Good training reduces this risk, but humans making calls means errors will be made eventually.<p>In the end, reducing support to the bare minimum possible appears a reasonable option for many companies: it is the easiest to implement, it reduces legal&#x2F;PR risks, and it has a very measurable and consistent effect (how many people stop buying&#x2F;using your service after failing to get support). If that number is low enough, it just doesn&#x27;t make economical sense to try to provide good support, which is a <i>very</i> hard endeavor for the reasons mentioned above."
"Markets around the world are determining prices on a massive variety of instruments that derive value from the current and future value of products such as currencies, interest rates, equities, grains, livestock, metals, oil, gasoline, natural gas, and electricity.  These prices allow us to prioritize resources, make fair transactions, and manage risk (i.e. buy insurance on the value of critical products so that we can plan and invest more effectively).  The value of all these instruments are related to one another, as well as to realtime world events, in complex ways that no one entity has a perfect view of.  Consequently, markets work by polling the expertise of many different parties who all understand a piece of how things should be valued.  This results in millions, if not billions, of interconnected price-discovery feedback loops.  The markets are kind of like a massive, distributed, realtime, ensemble, recursive predictor that performs much better than any one of its individual component algorithms could. The reason why shaving a few milliseconds (or even microseconds) can be beneficial is because the price discovery feedback loops get faster, which allows the system to determine a giant pricing vector that is more self-consistent, stable, and beneficial to the economy.  It&#x27;s similar to how increasing the sample rate of a feedback control system improves performance and stability.  Providers of such benefits to the markets get rewarded through profit."
"I&#x27;ve developed a fascination with astrophotography, one day hope to have a camera that can manage more than pinpoints&#x2F;streaks&#x2F;black noise, and while I always liked to go look at the stars on clear nights the technical aspects of it have reawakened the interest in space. Seeing the Milky Way across the sky at night with the naked eye is amazing and makes it hard to forget your smallness. You can get lost thinking stars are just pinpoints of light because they all generally look the same, but larger masses of them and seeing galaxies, clusters etc in binoculars etc just juices me up. Imaging that I can SEE Jupiter but the light is taking 45min to reach me is mind-blowing. Forget the larger distances to stars...it&#x27;s inconceivable at times. Sometimes I have gotten vertigo seeing how our Solar system is tilted and imagining us swirling through the arm.<p>One thing that seems to have changed is visible satellites. Or maybe I am just missing them. I recall as a child watching the sky with my grandfather and you&#x27;d regularly see a &quot;star&quot; moving across the sky and he&#x27;d excitedly point it out as a satellite."
"In Windows on a 16GB RAM laptop, I&#x27;ve often fired up Matlab, opened a 32GB matrix, and performed a few simple operations on it. In Windows Matlab dutifully chugs away on the problem, the disk spins like mad, and I put Matlab in the background and do email for 20 minutes. This identical use case completely cripples my Linux Mint OS, the mouse hangs, nothing functions, and I&#x27;ve never gotten it to even complete the operation. I just can&#x27;t operate on a 32GB matrix with 16GB of RAM in Linux, but I can in Windows with relative ease.<p>To me, this is the Linux kernel&#x27;s biggest weakness against Windows. Most other gripes about Linux (poor power management, poor driver support, etc) belong outside the kernels domain, but this one is a glaring win for Windows over Linux."

"Mocking is hard <i>really</i> hard, in order to mock something you need to imitate its functionality and interface. This means the mock is inherently tightly-coupled to the implementation, which is now another dependency in your system.<p>After trying to work with mock databases and file systems, I&#x27;ve personally found that there&#x27;s no substitute for the real thing.

"I&#x27;ve seen a couple of comments here talking about feature flags and I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s quite what Carmack is getting at here.<p>It seems he&#x27;s talking more about refactoring&#x2F;optimizing&#x2F;debugging working code rather than adding new features. Then the old version of the code becomes a point of reference against which you test your new implementation.<p>Once you are very confident that your new implementation is no worse than the old implementation you have two choices.<p>1. Leave your old implementation around as a reference implementation, but mainly use your new implementation. This is useful if your old implementation is functional and readable but slow and your new implementation is less readable but faster. This helps other developers understand your new implementation.<p>2. Remove your old implementation altogether and just keep your new implementation in your codebase.<p>Either way the thing Carmack is advocating for is having an extended period of time where the two implementations coexist, even though one of the implementations is &quot;redundant.&quot; He is explicitly advocating this despite the fact that you could in theory just retrieve the redundant implementation from version control and not have to &quot;pollute&quot; your codebase with a redundant implementation."

"I&#x27;m dealing with an insurance mess right now. I got a physical at a in-network doctor a month ago and they sent my blood sample to an out-of-network lab. My insurer sent me a statement last week saying that $444 of the $954 bill is eligible for payment. However since I hadn&#x27;t met my deductible for out-of-network spending yet, I would have to pay that entire $444 on top of the $510 that they wouldn&#x27;t cover even if the sample had been sent to a in-network lab.<p>I believe&#x2F;am hopeful that since I live in New York, which prohibits out-of-network providers from surprise billing patients without the patient&#x27;s informed and explicit consent that the procedure would be considered out-of-network [0], that I ultimately won&#x27;t be held liable for the bill.<p>Fortunately as a software engineer, I can trivially afford to pay the bill in the worst case.

Ones that weren&#x27;t driven by the community? (Where that could indicate it was simply a nicer more cohesive community, with that as the cause instead of the green stuff)<p>That said, this is the sort of result that <i>feels</i> like it should be true, but then those are the results we should most be thorough about our methods to avoid confirmation bias.

"It&#x27;s important to remember that an insurance company has very little to zero incentive to lower costs. The only incentive an insurer has is to ensure costs are predictable. It doesn&#x27;t matter if costs go up 20% next year as long as they know costs will not go up 25%. The extra cost gets shunted into the premium.<p>There is no party in the current healthcare system whose incentive is to lower prices. Medicare&#x2F;Medicaid can achieve low costs by fiat, but it&#x27;s broadly accepted that the whole system as structured today couldn&#x27;t operate on those prices [1]. This means private insurance picks up the delta.<p>Doctors, Hospitals, Pharmacies, Drug companies, Medical device companies all have zero incentive to lower prices. You might think technology that makes doctors visits (to pick one example) would just win out in the marketplace, but there&#x27;s a flawed assumption there. Most people are insured, so most people are paying the insured cost. For something like a doctor&#x27;s visit, you pay your copay (say, $25) and the insurer pays the rest (lets say up to $70). Assume you could get an app or a technology that gets that price down to $35. This would be a huge achievement and you&#x27;d go out of business because it&#x27;s more expensive than what the consumer sees.<p>Ah yes, but maybe you can pitch to insurers, surely they would love a lower cost! Probably not. You&#x27;re small so you can&#x27;t reduce their costs across the board. Even if you succeed, they have caps on how many profits they can take (usually something like 15-20%) so if you drop their costs, that might actually force them to refund customers. Good, but not the primary driver for profitability.<p>Let&#x27;s even grant that the above isn&#x27;t true. You&#x27;re still a small player, you basically need to fit inside their (extremely cumbersome) protocols to be able to bill them. Now you have to do all sorts of billing and management, maybe you need to hire extra staff to run billing. That $35 now financially doesn&#x27;t make sense, maybe it&#x27;s now $55. Still cheaper but now you&#x27;re in the system and don&#x27;t have much of a competitive advantage that&#x27;s visible to the consumer. Now you differentiate by offering better services, maybe a good online portal, that costs more engineers, and now we&#x27;re back up to $70. Insurer doesn&#x27;t care much, you&#x27;re just another provider, they&#x27;ll pay, you&#x27;ll make money, and we&#x27;re back to square one.<p>We&#x27;re not even considering the, &quot;Is the cancer doc that costs 25% less the same value as the other guy?&quot; problem, which is damn hard on its own.<p>Healthcare is really hard, and the incentives across the board are perverse. I&#x27;m increasingly skeptical a solution that doesn&#x27;t dramatically reshape the market is likely to make a difference.<p>[1] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.healthcarefinancenews.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;mgma-majority-practices-say-cost-care-outweighs-medicare-reimbursements"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.healthcarefinancenews.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;mgma-majority-pra...</a>"

Perhaps if there was a donation link there it might be of more benefit.<p>On the other hand, a political statement in a font is a very interesting idea. I hope it helps drive a campaign to normalize legal districting in the future."

This is no different."
"This looks great, and I&#x27;m eager for more!<p>I was initially put off by going straight to the repo&#x27;s declared homepage (the Playground) and just seeing two empty text areas. The repo README isn&#x27;t quite enough on its own - as you say, the interactive scripting experience is a huge part of the value here.<p>I strongly recommend doing what you can to get visitors to that experience as directly as possible. For example: pre-filling the Playground with a short, good example (e.g. the JSON-to-table one). Many people won&#x27;t get as far as pasting that into the empty Playground. Once I tried it, everything made considerably more sense to me. (I&#x27;m not a regular FP coder; I&#x27;ve done some Elm, some Miranda in college, that&#x27;s it.)<p>There are plenty of other things you can do (embed a couple of GIFs in the README; offer a choice of examples in the Playground) but I&#x27;d focus on (a) getting people to the Playground (b) prefilling the Playground with an example (c) add a few explanatory comments to the example.<p>Again, this looks great, and I&#x27;m eager to use it. Congrats!"

"Every language has flaws. Some of the best languages are those that take existing languages and just throw out some of the bad legacy mistakes, making what’s often a slightly different but pretty much objectively “better” language.<p>For example: Kotlin is a better Java in almost every way.<p>The problem with almost all such languages is that they aren’t different enough from their “parent” languages, meaning they struggle to gain traction. Both D and Kotlin are here."
"My SO is currently in hospice after 6 brain surgeries for brain cancer (4 over last year with her state gradually deteriorating). For the last year she was severly disabled and had to be help with sitting down, standing up, lying down and adjusting pillows and blankets as she had very limited use of her hands and general body coordination. She had to be kept safe while walking. It wasn&#x27;t as good life as she had before but it was life. She was spending time with family, watching ton of netflix and movies, enjoying meals, especially when on steroids. She even managed, with a bit of help, to throw a party for my 40th birthday in march this year, that was cool enough to stave off my usual birthday downward mood swing.<p>Now she&#x27;s lying in hospice bed with only minor control of her eyes and even less of her mouth. Barely concious. At most minimally responsive. Feeding tube, oxygen, urinary catheterer, central venous catheter. She&#x27;s kept alive and somewhat sedated.<p>First reccurence she had after 5 years after initial treatment and diagnosis. Last recurrence happend in two months. It&#x27;s already a month past last operation.<p>I&#x27;m a bit torn because I&#x27;m firm realist and I believe no matter how bad life is, it is the only thing that has a value for you because it&#x27;s the only thing you have. When your life ends, there&#x27;s nothing else, no new game, not even admiring your high score. Your life has an ultimate value to you and you have to try to make the best of it even if it consists of sleeping on morphine all the time till your body just falls apart.<p>On the other hand... she wished to die on an operating table under general anesthesia. Unfortunately she had too good surgeon for that to happen. If she were to spend 5 years like that I think she&#x27;d wish for her cancer to grow faster."

"I think this paragraph is worth the article:<p><i>We continue to feel incredibly uncomfortable about playing the role of content arbiter and do not plan to exercise it often. Some have wrongly speculated this is due to some conception of the United States&#x27; First Amendment. That is incorrect. First, we are a private company and not bound by the First Amendment. Second, the vast majority of our customers, and more than 50% of our revenue, comes from outside the United States where the First Amendment and similarly libertarian freedom of speech protections do not apply. The only relevance of the First Amendment in this case and others is that it allows us to choose who we do and do not do business with; it does not obligate us to do business with everyone.</i>"
There&#x27;s a bit of scaremongering in the headline; these are being tested domestically by the DOD use outside of the US. The DOD isn&#x27;t allowed to conduct domestic surveillance.

EU has the advantage that most of its small and old cities are very dense. I think it makes a lot of sense to start removing cars from their city centers. Cars are not particularly efficient or convenient anyway in narrow streets. That being said I really wonder why Amsterdam still allows cars to drive in its rings.

"&gt; This type of innovation takes significant up-front design time, and working on components over longer than one week iterations. Because the projects have such simple external interfaces, and so much internal complexity, much of the work is not even visible to “customers”, so there is no way to write customer visible stories about it. This type of software takes 8–20 months to deliver the first working version to the customer.<p>At Yahoo, I designed and built a large project. This took about six months to deliver. At the time, the company was doing quarterly reviews that I think Marissa had imported from Google. Anyway, my manager had rated me as &quot;meets expectations&quot; for a few quarters because this project and the one I had previously worked on weren&#x27;t visible to &quot;customers&quot; till they were delivered, so he didn&#x27;t have any evidence to justify a higher rating against other managers&#x27; team members.<p>Little did my manager know that a few quarters of &quot;meets expectations&quot; had caused HR to drop me into the bottom 5% of the company and so I received a letter from HR that I was at risk of being terminated.<p>So I deliver the project and now it&#x27;s visible and everyone loves it and I get an &quot;exceeds expectations&quot; rating and then a promotion and a raise.<p>From being warned I&#x27;d be terminated to a promotion in less than six months, with no change in my work, but simply it becoming visible.

"What does free speech have to do with this? Cloudflare and other companies have 1st amendment rights as well. One of them is that they can serve customers as they like, as long as they are not violating the rights of a protected class. Political ideology or party affiliation is not a protected class, nor should it be. Twitter could ban every Republican on its platform tomorrow and it if the government tried to stop them the Supreme Court would likely side with Twitter.<p>Companies are allowed to discriminate against political ideology as much as they like.

Mechanics have a common set of fundamentals that they all know and share, and can use to communicate with each other about their work. The purpose of this knowledge is not to be able to fabricate new car parts, although given time and the right equipment, it could probably be done.<p>The purpose of CS fundamentals is not to so much to implement complex algorithms, as to understand how to use tools and libraries that are based on them."

I trained a deep learning (DL) model to visually understand what elements are in a webpage (e.g. input, button, nav, etc) and build the front-end boiler plate automatically for me.

"&gt; All types are allowed, except void and callable<p>Urgh. It baffles me that 10 years after their introduction, anonymous functions (closures) remain useless when assigned to instance properties.<p><pre><code>    class Foo {

Callables work perfectly fine when assigned to standalone variables or array members: e.g. $foo[0](); But they become nonfunctional when assigned to instance properties. I understand that using closures as instance properties would make them hard to distinguish from methods, but blurring that distinction is just so damn useful in JavaScript!"

The problem is not that the element you are trying to animate gets blurry (eg. trying to animate text, it will be rendered on GPU, thus moved to its own layer, it might become blurry sometimes), but the problem is that OTHER elements on the page are affected. Try to scale-in the logo in top left of the page? Great, now the text in right sidebar starts jiggling while the animation is running. Want to turn around an image on hover? No problem, only that the SVG icons on the page now have a line artifact through them. Those issues only happen in Chrome, which seems to try too hard (and to have also tried) to optimize for performance over quality."

"As this is Hacker News, Paul Graham&#x27;s comments on Yahoo during the .com bubble are particularly relevant:<p>By 1998, Yahoo was the beneficiary of a de facto Ponzi scheme. Investors were excited about the Internet. One reason they were excited was Yahoo&#x27;s revenue growth. So they invested in new Internet startups. The startups then used the money to buy ads on Yahoo to get traffic. Which caused yet more revenue growth for Yahoo, and further convinced investors the Internet was worth investing in.

"This is great news.<p>There will be lots of people who are frustrated by this.  They may say that Cloudflare shouldn&#x27;t remove content unless they are legally required.  Or that a CDN like Cloudflare is a platform layer, deep in the stack, and that it shouldn&#x27;t be making decisions based on content.  That they are a essentially a utility, and that they should provide the the same service to everyone.<p>But at the end of the day, companies are run by people.  And those people <i>should</i> consider the positive and negative concequences of the services they provide.  It is the moral thing to do.  It is the right thing to do.  It is the courageous thing to do.<p>That doesn&#x27;t mean they must block every potentially bad actor.  And they don&#x27;t need to block based explicitly on content.  Here, the line was drawn at &quot;platforms that have demonstrated they directly inspire tragic events and are lawless by design.&quot;  But when situations arise that cause decision makers at an organization to re-consider providing their services to their customers, they should take that opportunity to re-evaluate.  They should ask, &quot;Do we want to be hosting this?&quot;<p>In this case, they said &quot;No.&quot;<p>Maybe some other customers will leave, afraid of being kicked off next.  They should take that into account.  If you think your service is sufficiently like 8Chan, you should probably leave Cloudflare.  Or if you think Cloudflare&#x27;s decision was arbitrary and that worries you, you should leave.<p>But maybe others will be happy that their CDN doesn&#x27;t need to be associated with hosting 8Chan&#x27;s content.  I know I feel that way.<p>Maybe the goodwill you receive will lead to more financial success.  But you&#x27;ll probably never know.  In all likelihood, so long as your customers aren&#x27;t leaving in droves after you kick someone off your platform, you&#x27;ll never know if the decision was the right financial decision.<p>You&#x27;ll probably never know if it was a net positive or negative on your balance sheet.  But you might sleep better at night.  And maybe sites that enable the propagate hate will find it a little bit harder to survive.  And I think that&#x27;s great."

"I consider it nonsense because it becomes dogma at each organization. The problem with that is that they each have their own way of being “agile” and questioning the status quo is futile at best to politically charged at worst.<p>Secondly, well meaning management often thinks that the reason they are having trouble delivering on time is because agile needs to be implemented. If the developers and business analysts don’t have deep understanding of the problem set then the project is at risk. All the agile in the world won’t fix that.<p>Hiring developers is not easy, and finding those that can deliver is also tough. Agile doesn’t solve that.<p>That said I do prefer an agile like approach to dev ops because it usually encourages teams to communicate and break work down into smaller pieces. When that happens system wide issues come to light much quicker than they would in a waterfall style delivery.<p>As it relates to the quora question, I suspect that the person that asked the question is pretty new to development. Google is huge, there is probably a million different styles of dev ops happening there. Ok that was hyperbole, but steelframes comment is exactly right. Google isn’t a monolith and googlers aren’t all the same."

"This is a really cool project.

I haven’t done much electronics, but digital signal processing doesn’t seem that expensive?<p>The cost is in R&amp;D, not just for human trials but for DSP engineer salaries. It&#x27;s an extremely specialized skillset and the companies that hire for it look for PhDs most of the time.<p>In particular, optimizing adaptive filtering to clock in the dozens of cycles per buffer with fixed point DSPs to maximize battery life, while providing features like feedback reduction, noise cancellation, working around the infamous &quot;cocktail party&quot; problem, with modern features like Bluetooth... all with audio fidelity on par with some serious audiophile gear.<p>My understanding is that there are also some other market forces too like very long lifecycle management and low volumes for new products, but idk how real that is.<p>Point is, I don&#x27;t think those devices are really overpriced - at least no more than any other medical device paid for by insurance companies.<p>EDIT:<p>I&#x27;m reading some of their documents and a few things jump out at me. They mention supporting FFT&#x2F;IFFTs on the platform. This stands out to me since doing that on a battery powered device is unusual. Firstly because it&#x27;s not cheap in cycles, and secondly because useful FFTs require rather large buffers of memory which harms your latency, and may come at a premium. When I&#x27;ve seen them required (e.g, a codec), it was typically on a dedicated FPGA with the algorithm burned in, not running on the DSP."

The prosecutors alleged she wanted to sleep around and she couldn&#x27;t because of the kids. I&#x27;m struct by the fact that there was no direct evidence that the mother was responsible for the deaths. The only &quot;evidence&quot; seems to have been that it was not clear why the girls died:<p><i>Both deaths were consistent with deliberate airway obstruction, and doctors could not find “any natural reason why either, let alone both, should have died”, prosecutors said.</i><p>I would have thought that if there was uncertainty about the cause of death (and that is exactly what &quot;the doctors could not find any natural reason&quot; states: uncertainty about the cause of death) then there is no sufficient evidence to convict.<p>But, I&#x27;m going by only what&#x27;s in The Guardian article and I don&#x27;t know the details of the case."

"I find RegEx&#x27;s a bit cryptic. Sure, with enough practice one can read them, but I&#x27;d like an alternative that can easily break out chunks as named units.

It could help do for RegEx&#x27;s what SQL&#x27;s WITH statement did for long SQL statements.<p>Backus–Naur Form could act as a starting point, but it needs some syntactic adjustments to make it more compact and practical, in my opinion.

"This is great, I&#x27;m very new to Go and new to RPCs. I went through the code and had a question someone might be able to answer as I&#x27;m still learning Go.<p>The Server package contains the Register function. Main package implements the QueryUser function that does the work of querying the DB. When Main calls Server.Register to register the function with Server, it sends the function name (QueryUser) and..something else? Is that the memory address of QueryUser on my computer? And when Server actually runs the function, it&#x27;s just pointing to QueryUser at the memory address given to it by Main?<p>If that&#x27;s the case, am I correct in thinking that this wouldn&#x27;t work as written if the Server package were running on a different physical server, because it obviously wouldn&#x27;t be able to access the memory location of QueryUser on a different machine. So in this case, the Server would need to implement QueryUser itself on its hardware, but otherwise would work.<p>Or maybe the use case of RPCs isn&#x27;t for two servers communicating, but rather for two different programs on the same machine only? Or maybe what Server.Register receives is the actual function, not just the memory location (though I see no evidence of this).<p>Can someone help enlighten me?"

"It&#x27;s always great to see public domain books being made available, and standardebooks is certainly worth a visit.  However, while I read quite a lot and in particular the sort of books that are available there, I mostly give the site a miss purely because of its design.  I don&#x27;t want to seem too sarcastic, but having huge images as a listing for books is odd when most of the users can read quite well.  I&#x27;m probably a bit sensitive about this, since our local library does the same thing - it almost looks like there is something about uncompromisingly textual information that provokes a reaction from web designers."

"I don’t understand the economics of Brex. I used to work for a large, analytics-savvy credit card company, and people would freak out if the percentage of customers going bad (not paying their debt) exceeded something like 3-5%. Given that VC-funded startups fail at a rate of 11&#x2F;12, isn’t Brex effectively throwing money down a massive black hole, assuming they’re extending credit? And this is at the top of credit cycle, probably within a few years of a recession, where a higher than normal percentage of good debt will go bad too."

"Suppose that it is true that it takes 10,000 hours to become expert at software development, just like for other arts and skills. Then, if the half life of IT is 10 years, you have to accumulate 5,000 hours of new learning every 10 years. Consequently, you have to devote about 10 hours&#x2F;week to learning new stuff in order to keep current. If you are lucky in managing your career much of this can be done on the job. Otherwise it must be done on your own time. It is the inability or unwillingness of software developers to devote this much time to continuing learning that accounts for their early obsolescence."

In short, maybe (least in my case) autistic people senses and other parts of the brain kick in earlier at a time when we are less able to process them and this becomes another party of the puzzle.<p>But would I change if I could go back in time and become normal  is a question I have asked myself and the answer for me is - no, though the thought of what life would of been like, naturally yields to pondering."

"I think what a lot of comments are missing is that the value of a browser is directly boosted by the value provided by its extensions.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t have switched to Firefox from Chrome if most of the extensions I was using wouldn&#x27;t have had readily available equivalents or workarounds. I would have held off on test-driving the new Edge as my daily workhorse browser if I hadn&#x27;t noticed an extension for my password manager in the Microsoft Store and found that I can install most extensions from the Chrome Web Store too.<p>Netscape and Opera prove that the paid browser business model is dead, sure, but that doesn&#x27;t mean browsers (especially browsers developed by companies with lots of related paid services) don&#x27;t represent value for the companies developing them -- and that those companies don&#x27;t profit from that value.<p>Google especially benefits massively from Chrome&#x27;s marketshare -- even to the extent that their own web services can get away with treating competitor browsers as second-class citizens. Extension developers contribute to the value driving that marketshare and open source extension developers do so with practically no return on investment.<p>This is just another example of the true sharing economy of open source clashing with capitalism (which is inherently based on extracting surplus value as profit, not sharing it back). Which would be fine, really, if the people participating in the sharing economy wouldn&#x27;t also exist in capitalism and have to rely on their success under capitalism to ensure basic subsistence like food, shelter and the means of extension development.<p>Extension developers using ads, tracking, malware or selling their extensions to malicious entities are just trying to find ways within the system to capitalise at least on some of the value they&#x27;ve provided. That&#x27;s undesirable and developers shouldn&#x27;t be in such dire circumstances to be willing to give in, but this is a systemic problem.<p>Luckily unlike with most systems, this system is almost entirely in the hands of browser vendors. Browser vendors could emphasize donation options -- just look at how big open source projects like some Linux distros push donations while still allowing for freeloading. But browser vendors currently have no direct incentive to do so -- in fact, doing so might actually harm their metrics."

"There&#x27;s a very obvious reason for why mobile Internet in Germany is flaky, slow yet at the same time ridiculously expensive:<p>During the UMTS spectrum licence auction in 2000 the incumbents, state-owned T-Mobil and Mannesmann (later bought by Vodafone) feared new entrants to the market and in order to keep other players out of the market placed bids much higher than the amount those licences could be reasonably expected to bring in in the subsequent years.<p>In the meantime, Germany and its finance minister at the time rejoiced in the sudden, unexpected windfall.<p>The whole spectacle was even televised. People just generally and shortsightedly assumed that the higher the amount raised by the auction the better.<p>The auction&#x27;s &#x27;winners&#x27; however wrote off the costs over the next few years and didn&#x27;t make enough profit to properly invest in the necessary infrastructure.<p>Apparently, none of the participants learned from this disaster because in 2019 when the 5G licences were up for sale they by and large committed the same mistakes again (though not to the same frivolous extent as in 2000):<p><a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.euronews.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;06&#x2F;12&#x2F;germany-raises-6-point-55-billion-euros-in-epic-5g-spectrum-auction"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.euronews.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;06&#x2F;12&#x2F;germany-raises-6-point-5...</a>"

"Insurance is <i>not</i> supposed to make routine things more affordable. It&#x27;s supposed to spread the risk of catastrophic loss from unlikely events around to a large group of people so you don&#x27;t have to worry about losing your house if you get struck by lightning. Everyone needs routine medical care at some point so an insurance model doesn&#x27;t work there.<p>You don&#x27;t have gas or grocery insurance, do you? If that were a thing would we all expect to pay less for gas and groceries, or would we just be tacking on overhead for routine expenses for no reason?<p>Using insurance for routine, affordable expenses is one of the problems. But it&#x27;s a race to the bottom where insurance companies win, because everyone in the U.S. thinks &quot;good&quot; insurance pays for everything and makes a 17% profit out of nothing.<p>In addition to the transparency the article advocates for, we&#x27;d probably be way better off with a universal health care stipend and very high deductible insurance for rare catastrophic events. Insurance should not be involved in routine care."
"8chan and its ilk are primarily symptoms. Of just exactly what, I&#x27;m not sure.

"Thought experiment (I don&#x27;t actually want to go down this road): can you out-market Amazon in this scenario? If you have a $400 committed spend for a $500 rent discount, can you find people who would buy things from Amazon anyway and offer to make purchases on their behalf at a 1% discount (which is, on paper, obviously rational for them), such that you&#x27;re now getting back $396 of the $400? Now you&#x27;re spending a mere $4 for the $500 rent discount.<p>And in turn, why would market rent for your area be N instead of N-$500 (or N plus discount matching), if that discount is generally available? If <i>everyone</i> gets the $500 Amazon discount, then <i>everybody</i> has the switching cost problem, and so landlords would want to match what the market is actually willing to pay, not what it looks like they&#x27;re paying on paper. This is basically the same scenario as early termination fees - when cell phone companies decided to increase the switching cost, other cell phone companies said they&#x27;d eat that increase in switching cost just to unlock locked-in customers that they couldn&#x27;t reach.<p>And ultimately all of these mechanisms are annoying and fiddly mental overhead, but could purchasers band together and join an organization that negotiates on their behalf, organizes boycotts, etc. for a relatively small fee?"

"Based on the short literature research I did that&#x27;s visible in my other comment, I came to some rough ideas on how to make a good sleep tracker. If there are people who want to work on it, feel free to reach out. Creating this as a side project might be something I was going to do anyway to learn about data science and some simple hardware hacking. It&#x27;s currently 2nd on the list (only beaten by the 1st thing: prepping for interviews).<p>What I think that technically needs to happen at minimum is:<p>1. Movement<p>2. HRV<p>3. EEG (brainwaves)<p>That will be the minimum viable product that may become as good as polysomnography and bring sleep lab tech to your home. Dreem claims to be doing this, but it isn&#x27;t clear whether their claims are true.<p>Companies like Zeo produced presumably good results, yet they are now bankrupt. It&#x27;s quite infuriating to see. So there&#x27;s a business model (or simply an organizational problem at Zeo at the time) and I&#x27;m not clear what it is. The tech is already here! For example, Somté PSG shows that it can be done, and I&#x27;m simply thinking to myself: this could be more user friendly, couldn&#x27;t it? [1]<p>Marketing-wise, I think the following needs to happen:<p>1. Get multiple unrelated universities to test your device against polysomnography and iterate against it.<p>2. Once it&#x27;s within the 90% agreement range, then even make a YouTube video about such tests. Keep testing it against the golden standard, because if you are as good as the golden standard, then you can really state you track sleep.<p>3. Also test different PSGs with each other, because while PSG is the golden standard, no study told to what extent they actually agree on sleep metrics. There probably are studies on it but they didn&#x27;t test this (or comment on it even, I believe) when wearables such as a Fitbit were studied as well.<p>4.

"From the article:<p>&gt; According to the European Court of Justice ruling, a site that embeds the Facebook “like” icon and link on its pages also sends user data to the US web giant.<p>This is categorically false. The site that embeds the like icon is sending absolutely nothing to Facebook. The user&#x27;s browser is the one sending information. You have control over your browser. You can do something about it if you don&#x27;t like it.<p>The EU&#x27;s regulations infantilize the public and removes consumer choice."
"For what it&#x27;s worth, I used to work for GS and was in the algorithmic brokerage business for 2009-2010.  One thing a lot of commenters on this thread are missing here is this isn&#x27;t the same as an HFT or hedge fund, this is the brokerage business - executing orders on behalf of GSs clients, who are largely institutional investors, hedge and pension funds etc.<p>The real-world impact of increased speed of execution by brokers is less money left on the table for HFTs to snap up and less slippage to the actual economic beneficiary (ie the actual retail investor or pension fund investing people&#x27;s money gets a better trade)."
"This issue arises because, if the site allows any public sharing, the &quot;create filter&quot; UI gives team members the option to share a new filter with &quot;Everyone&quot;, which sounds like an org-local scope but is in fact a public&#x2F;non-logged-in scope. The org-level scope is called, &quot;Open&quot;, and is not part of this UI. Sigh.<p>To prevent this issue as a site admin on Jira cloud, go to:<p><pre><code>    Jira Settings -&gt; System -&gt; General Configuration
</code></pre>
and disable &quot;Allow users to share dashboards and filters with the public.&quot; This doesn&#x27;t affect existing filters, which you have to manually fix.<p>In true Jira fashion, if you try to reassign a filter <i>after</i> flipping this setting, it will deny the operation and ask you to edit the ACL, which there is no convenient admin UI to do.<p>Jira is a disaster of UX."

"I always used public transport (metro&#x2F;train&#x2F;bus) to go to work.
Two years ago I had to commute daily by car (just 20 minutes) and felt miserable. For me it was a total waste of time and energy.<p>Two months ago I switched jobs and started to go to work on my bycicle because the office is just 1 metro station away from home and I have bycicle way from home to work (which is very unusual in Madrid, by the way). This is probably the best job perk I ever had."
On the one hand it sucks because clearly the quality might be lowered. On the other hand if Apple invests on Siri doing its thing mostly on the device like Mycroft does that would be worthwhile.

"This post is so wrong headed and misguided that it borders on parody.<p>Some choice quotes from the post:<p>&gt; It is a truism, too, in workplaces, that faster employees get assigned more work.<p>&gt; Whereas the fast teammate—well, their time feels cheap, in the sense that you can give them something and know they’ll be available again soon.<p>&gt; push yourself to go faster than you think is healthy.<p>Dude that’s not a feature. It’s a bug."
"...actually it doesn&#x27;t sound to me like this article is about HFT-based prop trading at all (prop trading would mean Goldman Sachs taking positions onto their own books), but about the business unit called GSAT (Goldman Sachs algorithmic trading) who execute trades on behalf of clients, so never taking any positions onto their own books.<p>The traditional market model used to be that at every point in time, a market maker would offer a price to buy&#x2F;sell at.  The bid would, of course, be lower than the ask, the difference being called the spread.  When a pension fund wanted to execute a trade, they would have had to cross the spread, and, statistically speaking, half the spread would immediately accrue to the market maker as profit.  ..so this is money that YOU, the holder of a pension, are losing, and that THEY, the rich folks acting as market makers that the public likes to get mad at, are taking away from you.<p>The business model of GSAT is that a pension fund can ask Goldman Sachs to use algorithms to do things on their behalf that are less naive than what I just described above and end up giving less money to the market maker.  For example, GSAT can become a market maker on your behalf, but make a market on only one side, i.e. only offer a price to buy at or only offer a price to sell at, with the resulting trades being executed on your behalf, so it is now you who makes money off those trades, in the same way as it would traditionally be a market maker&#x27;s privilege to do.<p>The public loves to get mad at Wall Street.  But they should please get their facts straight about who the good guys are and who the bad guys are."

In my personal experience they are mostly too lazy or anxious to switch because of FUD, and&#x2F;or stingy. The situation is complicated because in most places the so called last mile is in the hands of the former state monopolist, which now is playing a joint-stock company, while the state holds about one third of shares directly and indirectly via the <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;KfW"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;KfW</a>
Then there are the tv-cable companies and the really complicated &quot;Netzebene 4&quot;, the last mile equivalent for anything Docsis in .de 
Complicated because of ownership, and non-sharing. This all feels really backwards, and <i>IT IS</i>!
Nonetheless i got away from the Deutsche Telokom ASAP when i had the chance.
A few anecdotes...
Lived in a not so large town about 199x. Got ISDN and payed them insane amounts of money for dual-channel (128Kb&#x2F;s). Flatrate? Not existent. Moved to a smaller town some years later, first DSL available, but not in my part of smalltown. 
Too far away from the exchange. Well, there was another option from Versatal. ISDN Flatrate(which Telekom didn&#x27;t even offer!) for 40 or 50 DM a month. Most people didn&#x27;t even knew, or didn&#x27;t dare, because the company had some mishaps(years) before. I didn&#x27;t care and had an excellent experience for the time, one could see the way the packets went via traceroute, which was very different from the way the telekom routed. Of course! Different company, different network. Anyways, blazingly fast(for ISDN). The € came, DSL didn&#x27;t. I moved to Hamburg and had the option to choose 
DSL from <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;de.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;HanseNet"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;de.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;HanseNet</a>
Again, excellent service, the speeds went slowly up without getting more expensive! Then they&#x27;ve been bought by Telecom Italia and it was renamed Alice. Didn&#x27;t matter, speeds went up further without getting more expensive(€29,90 flat with landline flat to other german landlines)
Some years later Telekom Italia sold Alice&#x2F;former Hansenet
to spanish Telefonica, which is branded O² in .de
That was a sad story because one could see how a good company with a good product went bad. Slower speeds, crappy routing&#x2F;peering, disconnects, changing dsl-standards without announcing them,  or sending a modem capable of handling that. One hand not knowing what the other does.
What to do? <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;de.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Wilhelm.tel"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;de.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Wilhelm.tel</a> to the rescue! Another local provider born out of a public utility, very progressive since its beginnings, best thing i ever had. I even got <i>more</i> instead of the announced <i>up to</i>.
Fibre to the basement and some VDSL with 100&#x2F;31 for the usual €29,90 flat with landline to german landlines phone flat included. Excellent peering, latencies, whatever.
Which will be upgraded to fiber to the home until end of the year, begin next year with gigabit, which i don&#x27;t really need.
Anyways, this is not the only provider apart from the big, mostly crappy ones, or resellers of them. There are

"Is anyone else extremely bothered by the false equivalence of narcotics trafficking and the need for homeland security?<p>This blurring of the lines between a multi-billion dollar _business_ (probably around 1% of the world&#x27;s GDP) that in fact relies on the success of the state, and purported threats to the state itself strikes me as extremely dangerous.<p>I&#x27;m contrasting this to American intelligence involvement in central America in the 1980s. During that time, the same organizations involved in cocaine trafficking and production were also extremely political, and crucial to the CIA carrying out their (in my opinion neoimperialist) &quot;responsibilities&quot; in the region.<p>My point is: I am aware of absolutely no evidence that modern drug trafficking organizations (DTOs) operating within the borders of the US are political whatsoever, so can we really view them as a threat to homeland security?

"I grew up with cassettes, and random access (lack thereof) was always the big drawback for me. Even vinyl, their predecessor, gave you that.

The technology is better for listening in order. Hence mixtapes.<p>Footnote: from hearing certain songs in the same order many times, like on my best &amp; most-played tapes, I eventually grew to expect the next song upon hearing the previous one end. So even though I quickly and enthusiastically abandoned the technology of cassettes, I did recreate some of those mixes as digital playlists."

"This once again goes to show that you can do nothing illegal and still be virtually locked out of the internet.

The canary in the coalmine was The Daily Stormer; all the content there would be considered very objectionable and completely without merit by any remotely sensible person, so few people complained about it being shut down.

"There&#x27;s this notion of &#x27;bad money chases out the good&#x27;; stems from the time when coinage was made from expensive rare metals. Because weighing your currency is annoying, the state decrees that any stamped coin is to be treated as if it is worth precisely what it says its worth, even if it is a little light.<p>In such scenarios, everyone saves up their fat coins and spends their most shaved off misshapen light coins. Eventually ALL the money in circulation is the &#x27;bad&#x27; money.<p>The same seems to happen with social networks: _IF_ you allow questionable stuff on your site, soon all the other users will go elsewhere, and your social network eventually caters ONLY to the questionable stuff. The counterweight to that would be lots of users who put inherent value in the notion that the social network they are a part of &#x27;does not believe in censorship&#x27;, but I think we all know a vanishingly small amount of non-incel&#x2F;dailystormer&#x2F;etc users care enough about it to hang out on the incel&#x2F;dailystormer&#x2F;etc social network, where every stranger you meet, is likely tweaked in the head.<p>Give it some time and I bet soon the same thing again will happen to CDNs: If most CDNs band together to censorship such content, on one hand there&#x27;ll always be a CDN that sees a mission (and perhaps, a business case) in being anti-censorship. But, soon, the ONLY thing that CDN will be hosting is questionable content. And at that point, I bet plenty of sites, filters, firewalls, internet providers, etc, will just blanket-ban the entire CDN and be rid of it all.<p>And then sites like 8chan possibly truly cannot survive.<p>Or not. Maybe they&#x27;ll find a way.<p>But if that happens, the &#x27;council of CDNs&#x27; will have quite a bit of power to wield.

"I remember having a realisation regarding null in SQL data models that is probably obvious to other people who paid attention to the &quot;History of SQL&quot; parts of the lecture, but was along the lines that tables are sets, and all relations are sets, so where a relation has no value, you are really just talking about the empty set, and there is only one of those. i.e. You can remove all null &quot;values&quot; from your tables by normalising on that column -- null was just where the join is now empty. (But obviously don&#x27;t actually do that, it was more a thought experiment for a null-less nirvana.)"

"I work on a large, legacy codebase (the oldest modules date from the mid-nineties) that&#x27;s slowly being rewritten from Perl into Python.  A handful of developers have been involved with the project from the beginning.  Looking at the long term contributors, readable or un-readable code seems to be more about the person than the language.  Unsurprisingly, the person who produced the most unreadable, unmaintainable code is now doing the same in a new Python only project.<p>I&#x27;ve always tried to look at programming in a similar manner as writing research papers, your ideas are no good if no one understands how they&#x27;re put to paper.  Explicitly stating your intentions is better than assuming the reader knows the subject matter.  If something is clever, overly-compact or your reviewer expresses confusion, rewrite it or at least spend an extra line or two in explanation.<p>At the language level, I miss Perl&#x27;s handling of regexps and shell commands (which consist of large amounts of this codebase).  Python requires a fair amount of overhead to handle both and always feels a little clunky.  While I&#x27;m far more fluent in Python, I typically reach for Perl when needing to quickly handle log files, automate shell tasks, and prototype ideas.  On the flip side, now that Python supports type hinting, function signatures are much more valuable, and overall I feel I can write far more robust tests in Python than Perl.  Given that the direction of the project is to move from a collection of one-off scripts that just kept on growing to a tested, maintainable, modular codebase, Python is the better choice."

"Denying your child access to an internet connected computer in 2019 would put your child in a very disadvantaged position in life.

There was never a centralized decision to make things this way. Nobody was ever asked if they were ok with this. It just happened.<p>Imagine that neuralink tech starts to become normal. Inevitably, some parents will opt to have their child linked. Many children will be linked regardless because it is medically necessary. The linked children perform five times better than the linkless. They socialize by electronic telepathy, even though they only have threads in their motor cortex in the early days. Being linked also enables them to engage in wildly addictive and inappropriate behavior that had never been widely anticipated before. You become a parent in the midst of this. Do you imagine that you would opt out? Do you imagine the parents of yesterday thought they would opt out of allowing their children to do what children do now?"

I could hardly believe that such a thing still existed anywhere in Europe, but even more surprising was that it was pay-by-the-minute.  There were a bunch of different providers that had different pricing plans where sometimes there would be a connection fee, but lower per-minute rates, and sometimes the rates would go down after so many minutes of connection.  The landlord set me up with some software that would try to minimize the cost of an internet session.  It would tell you which provider to go with based on an estimated connection duration that you gave it.  You could also configure it to hang up and dial into another provider if rates changed enough based on the time of day."

Further to the comments about the pager hammering the disk to read clean pages (mainly but not exclusively binaries) even if swapping is disabled: In many cases adding swap space will <i>reduce</i> the amount of paging which occurs.<p>Many long-lived processes are completely idle (when was the last time that `getty ttyv6` woke up?) or at a minimum have pages of memory which are never used (e.g. the bottom page of main&#x27;s stack).  Evicting these &quot;theoretically accessible but in practice never accessed&quot; pages for memory frees up more memory for the things which matter.

A range of socioeconomic and demographic factors are likely to confound these associations by contributing to mental health outcomes and to neighborhood selection. Previous research suggests that these factors are likely to include personal socioeconomic circumstances, such as how much money people have, whether they are employed, and their level of education, and other factors, such as age, sex, and relationship status. Accordingly, in this study, we adjusted for baseline measures of age, sex, annual household income, economic status (eg, employed, retired, or unemployed), highest educational qualification, and couple status.</i><p>There are a lot of measures that affect human wellbeing that this doesn&#x27;t take into account, however.

"Though nowhere near the epic event this is, one of the things I enjoy about watching Japanese shrines is when they go around and rebuild stuff.  Sometimes they even tear the whole thing down and build it again.  The first time I saw it, I was in shock -- Why are they tearing down the shrine?  But, no.  They built it again.  Sometimes they build it differently than before.  I&#x27;m not sure if this is due to finances or other constraints, or if there is some other reason.  The one thing that is constant is the trees.  You can almost always spot a shrine in Japan -- you see this weird outcropping of 500 year old trees :-)  Especially in the city it&#x27;s a bit like an oasis of nature -- an anchor to a more stable world.  Though I say more stable, really it changes all the time, but looks like it&#x27;s been like that forever.<p>I really enjoy these things.  I am not a religious person and I have next to no education in various religions.  However, these kinds of activities really speak to me.

Copyrights in their first 28-year term on January 1, 1978, still had to be renewed to be protected for the second term. If a valid renewal registration was made at the proper time, the second term will last for 67 years. However, if renewal registration for these works was not made within the statutory time limits, a copyright originally secured between 1950 and 1963 expired on December 31 of its 28th year, and protection was lost permanently.&quot;<p>* &quot;<i>Works originally copyrighted between January 1, 1964, and December 31, 1977</i>. Congress amended the copyright law on June 26, 1992, to automatically renew the copyright in these works and to make renewal registration for them optional. Their copyright term is still divided between a 28-year original term and a 67-year renewal term, but a renewal registration is not required to secure the renewal copyright. The renewal vests on behalf of the appropriate renewal claimant upon renewal registration or, if there is no renewal registration, on December 31 of the 28th year.&quot;<p>So there is a cutoff before 1964.  However, it&#x27;s not at all clear to me how many times the copyright holders didn&#x27;t renew their copyrights.  I would be unsurprised if the big publishers <i>did</i> typically renew them.  If a book was published in 1950 and it <i>was</i> renewed, then the copyright would continue until 2045 (1950+28+67).<p>I&#x27;ve only listed 2 cases (just before &amp; just after 1964), but there are actually many more cases and it&#x27;s all quite complicated.<p>I think copyright duration is grossly overlong, far in excess of what is needed to get people to create works."

Finally he switched back to Minecraft and got disgusted with the game quality of Roblox and dumped it.<p>I was relieved because if he hadn&#x27;t, I was getting ready to ban it. I had set up the account with parental controls to turn off chat because I knew adults played the game, but I ultimately decided it was inappropriate for kids after digging a little deeper and seeing what a toxic waste dump it is."

"&gt; The unresolved question is how should the law deal with platforms that ignore or actively thwart the Rule of Law? That&#x27;s closer to the situation we have seen with the Daily Stormer and 8chan. They are lawless platforms.<p>This doesn&#x27;t make a lot of sense. They are suggesting that it&#x27;s the fact that 8chan is <i>unmoderated</i> that is a problem, and they&#x27;ll similarly refuse service to any unmoderated discussion platform?<p>I actually totally approve of them refusing 8chan as a customer.<p>I don&#x27;t think this is really the reason, or a good reason. Articulating the real&#x2F;good reason is hard. I&#x27;m not sure I can do it either.<p>But when they say &quot;The Rule of Law requires policies be transparent and consistent&quot; -- that obligation is actually incumbent upon THEM, cloudflare. What is their own transparent and consistent policy that led to this? The <i>implication</i> is that... any unmoderated discussion forum would be banned, but they don&#x27;t go out and say it, which isn&#x27;t quite &quot;transparent&quot;.<p>And I don&#x27;t think they really mean that (so it&#x27;s not &quot;consistent&quot; either). An unmoderated discussion forum that <i>wasn&#x27;t</i> being used to egg on mass murder, they probably wouldn&#x27;t ban. I think the possible &quot;consistent&quot; approach here would be simply admitting that they dont&#x27; want as customers sites whose owners seem to have no problem with them being used to egg on mass murder.<p>As they said in another statement quoted by media, a site that has &quot;repeatedly proven itself to be a cesspool of hate.&quot;  This is more honest, and really no less vague, than dancing around talking about &quot;actively thwarting the Rule of Law&quot; (I really don&#x27;t know what that means; I&#x27;m not sure you can really &quot;actively thwart the rule of law&quot; without being in the government). And I personally agree it is a fine reason to refuse someone as a customer, that they&#x27;ve repeatedly proven themselves to be a cesspool of hate.<p>They are correct that the first ammendment in fact gives them the right to refuse as customers entities whose actions they find abhorent and whose business they don&#x27;t wish to aid. The principle of &quot;transparent and consistent&quot; requires them to try harder than they are to explain what their standards are in an honest way. (It can be a process, I&#x27;m not totally sure what they should be either, even though I totally support refusing 8chan as a customer).<p>I think calling an unmoderated discussion forum &quot;actively thwarting the Rule of Law&quot; (in all caps nonetheless!), then calling for government discipline of such, is something you gotta back up with more reasoning than they did here, and is not in fact necessary for them to justify denying service to 8chan. They&#x27;re trying to get out of actually explaining their reasoning&#x2F;motivation (what is required for THEM to be &quot;consistent and transparent&quot;) by hand-waving about all-capitals Rule of Law."

Highly effective teams have super high levels of trust and mutual accountability.<p>The moment you lose trust, you now have to replace trust with some other type of mechanism. This leads to process&#x2F;bureaucracy.<p>Trivial example for those that don’t “get it”: think about why do we need code reviews? If we knew people would write perfect code every time, they would never be needed. However, we hold them because we know that even in our own “best code” we may miss something&#x2F;forget some detail.<p>However, think about your own process, at least for me, depending on a feature&#x2F;the engineer, my code review might be cursory rather than super line by line. The difference? How much I trust that engineers ability in that specific type of code.<p>But that was a digression, my main point is that hight trust means high speed, low trust causes slow speeds.

Cuture fit is a blank check to fail a person&#x27;s interview just because you didn&#x27;t like them in the first 30 seconds. Short of the candidate showing some glaring interpersonal issues (I once had a guy who used the word &quot;fuck&quot; during his interview like 100 times) it is categorically impossible to establish in a 45 minute interview whether a person is actually a &quot;fit&quot; or not.

"It&#x27;s funny, these discussions go around and around in circles on HN.<p>Really, we should all just reference Popper&#x27;s Paradox of Tolerance[1].<p>A just, tolerant society should tolerate anything other than intolerance. Yes, this isn&#x27;t as simple as &quot;freedom of speech&quot;, but it makes a lot of sense.<p>Popper&#x27;s words argue this as well as anyone:<p><i>Less well known is the paradox of tolerance: Unlimited tolerance must lead to the disappearance of tolerance. If we extend unlimited tolerance even to those who are intolerant, if we are not prepared to defend a tolerant society against the onslaught of the intolerant, then the tolerant will be destroyed, and tolerance with them. — In this formulation, I do not imply, for instance, that we should always suppress the utterance of intolerant philosophies; as long as we can counter them by rational argument and keep them in check by public opinion, suppression would certainly be unwise. But we should claim the right to suppress them if necessary even by force; for it may easily turn out that they are not prepared to meet us on the level of rational argument, but begin by denouncing all argument; they may forbid their followers to listen to rational argument, because it is deceptive, and teach them to answer arguments by the use of their fists or pistols. We should therefore claim, in the name of tolerance, the right not to tolerate the intolerant.</i><p>[1] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Paradox_of_tolerance"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Paradox_of_tolerance</a>"

"Hm. I&#x27;ve been in the practice of figuring out plain old URLs to use as hrefs for social share. No JS. No loading of images or other content from the third party social network.<p>This, when it is doable, of course provides no tracking (until&#x2F;unless a user clicks the share button anyway) with no need for &quot;two clicks&quot; -- the remote site receives no network traffic at all unless you click the button, it&#x27;s just an ordinary static link.<p>I have generally been able to figure this out for major social network sites, either from documentation, third-party documentation, or watching HTTP requests made by the &#x27;official&#x27; JS solution. I guess it&#x27;s possible it violates the &quot;ToS&quot; of the remote site to do this, although I&#x27;m not sure ToS can really restrict my linking to the site with a URL. I guess this technique could be more subject to breakage, if the remote site changes it&#x27;s URL patterns, and the &quot;official&quot; (JS&#x2F;tracking) solution from the remote site is updated, but I&#x27;m not using that.<p>So there are potential downsides -- but I&#x27;m curious which of them (or something I&#x27;m not thinking of) leads people to a more complex (and slightly worse UX) solution like this, instead of just using static URLs."

Personal note:<p>I as a software developer myself was initially rather critical about taking a position at a gaming company due to stories of crunch time and low pay, but my experience has been very positive in both regards at InnoGames: Crunch time does not really apply to a mobile gaming company (very few hard deadlines), and especially not to our team, as it is not a game team; and I was offered a better compensation package than what I had initially asked for. The workflow and processes in the team are driven by ourselves, and the two worlds of the job between creating and maintaining software on one side and providing support to game teams on the other are challenging in a very positive way and provide a lot of variety.<p>We have several open tech positions but this one is directly in my team so feel free to shoot me any questions about the position at dennis dot neufeld at innogames dot com<p>Link: <a href=""http:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.jobvite.com&#x2F;m?3LZ4zkwc"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.jobvite.com&#x2F;m?3LZ4zkwc</a><p>Other open positions: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.innogames.com&#x2F;career&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.innogames.com&#x2F;career&#x2F;</a>"

"Germany&#x27;s internet is slow because it relies heavily on unbundling, implemented poorly: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.telekom.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;media&#x2F;media-information&#x2F;archive&#x2F;faqs-on-the-unbundled-local-loop-ull--358710"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.telekom.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;media&#x2F;media-information&#x2F;archive&#x2F;f...</a>. Telekom has little incentive to invest in upgrading its infrastructure because it has to lease it out to its competitors anyway.<p>Contrasting Germany and the U.K. offers a really good illustration of how important it is to set incentives correctly. The U.K. also relies heavily on unbundling, through BT. But when British Telecom was privatized, the U.K. intensely studied the issue of how to set the appropriate incentives: <a href=""http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bath.ac.uk&#x2F;management&#x2F;cri&#x2F;pubpdf&#x2F;Conference_seminar&#x2F;31_Model_Utility_Regulation.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bath.ac.uk&#x2F;management&#x2F;cri&#x2F;pubpdf&#x2F;Conference_semin...</a>. The end result was a regulatory structure where rates were set such that BT ended up being very profitable. (Last year, BT&#x27;s profit margin was around 16%, versus 3% for Telekom.) That created the incentive for BT to invest in pushing fiber further into its DSL network."

"The article says:<p>&gt; The main reason scientists have historically been resistant to using Bayesian inference instead is that they are afraid of being accused of subjectivity. The prior probabilities required for Bayes’ rule feel like an unseemly breach of scientific ethics. Where do these priors come from?<p>It&#x27;s not just &quot;being afraid&quot;; the problem is that random guessing (of priors) is not a reasonable replacement for science.<p>Bayes&#x27; rule is great if you can find a reasonable justification for a prior. Bayes is widely used for decision-making (for example), where you need an answer quickly &amp; you aren&#x27;t trying to make general scientific claims.  But if you can&#x27;t find a justifiable prior in a scientific work, using Bayes&#x27; rule just replaces one statistical fallacy for another one.  After all, Bayes&#x27; rule will give nonsense answers if you give it a nonsense prior!<p>Bayes&#x27; rule is a great tool in many circumstances!  But it has a great weakness: it requires a prior.  That doesn&#x27;t make it useless; few tools are useful in all circumstances.  But requiring &quot;everyone to use Bayes&#x27; rule, even though we have no reasonable way to find a good estimate of the priors,&quot; is unlikely to ever happen (and rightly so).  The article rightly points out a serious problem with the typical application of statistics, but there needs to be a better justification for priors than is suggested in this article.<p>I could imagine systemic worldwide ways to deal with this.  For example, perhaps the scientific community could allow people to propose initial priors, and then allow multiple different papers to improve the estimation of the probability over time.  But that would require much more than articles repeatedly saying &quot;there&#x27;s no serious problem with priors&quot;; having a justifiable way to estimate and update priors <i>is</i> the fundamental problem with Bayesian analysis in the scientific community."

"The big mess seems to be in the CSS&#x2F;Javascript space, where fad frameworks come and go rapidly. There&#x27;s more change than improvement. Visually, most web pages haven&#x27;t changed much, and web development has become much harder.<p>But we can now scroll forever. Slowly and jerkily.<p>On the language front, we really should have had a replacement for C&#x2F;C++ by now. We don&#x27;t. D never got traction. Go is mostly for web back ends, where it has really solid libraries heavily used within Google. Rust looked promising but was taken over by the &quot;functional&quot; crowd and is doomed to Haskell obscurity. C++ itself is now trying to fake ownership tracking at run time, with mediocre results. The abstractions always leak because too many old things need C pointers. Java was supposed to replace C&#x2F;C++ but became tangled in its own libraries and ended up replacing COBOL.<p>There&#x27;s been some progress. There&#x27;s now grudging agreement that the way to go is type declarations with some type inference. Having to type everything is too much of a pain. Not typing anything makes for unreadable programs. Function definitions really do need type info. So C++ added &quot;auto&quot; and Python added &quot;advisory typing&quot;, moving both towards the center. Which is about where Go started."

"One complicating factor that I put into every thread about random things being associated with autism: the diagnostic criteria for autism doesn&#x27;t just measure how autistic someone is, but also how well they&#x27;ve learned to cope with being autistic. It measures things like frequency of meltdowns, ability to handle their everyday life without assistance, ability to &quot;mask&quot; by doing things like holding eye contact or memorizing social scripts, etc.<p>Better brain function in general means that someone on the autism spectrum is less likely to have general life issues that lead to an official diagnosis. <i>Anything</i> that could reasonably be linked to a decrease in IQ can also reasonably be linked to autism.

"How would a commercial venture plan to recoup their investment cost when (if) they finally reach a viable reactor design?<p>If an American&#x2F;European company came out with a working reactor, would India and China pay for the technology, or would they put hundreds of billions into developing their own? What about the opposite scenario? Even a tiny peek at the design would shave off a large portion of the cutting edge investment.
On the other hand, fusion could completely alter the course of climate change, perhaps it&#x27;s cheaper in the long run to just give out the technology."

"I think we are at the point of risk where the volume of discoverable information is so great that the parties at &quot;risk&quot; are needles in the haystack.  There may be some analytical value in combing the available data, but if a specific target were interesting, they are probably already compromised.<p>In a way, it is to say that few organizations have especially interesting information.  The few that do can be compromised with social approaches.  So exposures such as these are becoming less and less embarrassing.  Every organization is dysfunctional to some degree, and every org has some communications that (especially taken out of context) might raise eyebrows; but that is life, and that is what happens when you gather numbers of people in one place.<p>Point is, stories like these are useful for adding to a corporate checklist of exposure safety, but they aren&#x27;t worth much else (unless of course the org holds secrets that could hugely disrupt the world)."

"Maybe some folks here will find my perspective informative, speaking as someone who made the transition from individual contributor to engineering manager around the age of 40.<p>I&#x27;ve worked at big companies since I graduated college. As a software engineer, I remained hyper-focused on specializing in pretty much one specific thing. I&#x27;ve never considered myself particularly brilliant in comparison with some of my peers, but the thing I chose to specialize in just so happened to become super-important to the technology sector about five to seven years ago. I was in the right place at the right time. I cleared my calendar for about half a year, shut out the world, and focused entirely on embodying all the expertise I had accumulated up until then into a new feature.<p>Now the thing I created is a critical feature in the phone you probably have in your pocket right now. As in, if I hadn&#x27;t created the feature, it&#x27;s very likely that a team would have been spun up in a company like Google or Samsung to create it instead.<p>This catapulted me into a relatively senior position, and then I found that my hyper-specialization couldn&#x27;t keep me competitive among my more capable and more generalist individual contributor peers. I got to my position by pulling a rabbit out of a hat at a critical point in time, and then I (proverbially) got promoted to my level of incompetence. I can&#x27;t possibly keep delivering the same super-high impact on a continual basis.<p>Shortly after I got promoted, my organization started to grow very quickly. Upper management was scrambling to build levels of hierarchy to absorb the growth, and they pretty much pushed me into managing a team in addition to working on some of the residuals of the technology I had built. I soon realized that I didn&#x27;t have the capacity to continue designing systems and writing code while effectively managing people at the same time. I felt that I had to make a choice: Either give up management and focus on individual contributor work, or make the switch entirely into management.<p>Of course I had formed for myself a false dichotomy. I could always go into consulting, switch career ladders to sales or product management, or something else along those lines. But getting a taste, I was finding that I <i>liked</i> management. Politics started becoming less of a dirty word for me, and I felt fulfilled and useful when I successfully negotiated a mutually beneficial compromise among parties in the organization. I loved figuring out what my reports needed and helping them to achieve their goals. I loved that I could hack some code here and there and not worry at all about whether it ended up shipping in the near future, since my impact was not being evaluated by that metric any more.<p>And so now, a little bit past 40, I am 100% an engineering manager. It&#x27;s something that I just sort of grew into, but at the same time it feels sort of inevitable if I am to stay at my current company. At my level of seniority, upper management would only be happy with me going back to an individual contributor role if I were to pull more rabbits out of hats. I suppose I&#x27;ve accepted that those days are probably behind me, and I&#x27;m ready for the next set of challenges."

"It&#x27;s easy to challenge the subjectivity of a prior, pretending that frequentist testing is objective... until you design your own experiment, rather than just analyze one. Turns out this is a more important part. It&#x27;d be illustrative to explain that process.<p>A p-value of 0.05 (or a test with 95% significance) will, if there&#x27;s actually nothing there, tell you&#x27;ll think there&#x27;s something there 5% of the time (wrongly). It says nothing about error rates if there is something there, which is presumably what we&#x27;re interested in. So for that, you&#x27;ll do what&#x27;s called a power analysis. Power of the conventional 80% tells you, if there&#x27;s actually an effect size of X and you know all about your noise, you&#x27;ll think there&#x27;s nothing there 20% of the time (wrongly).<p>5% comes out of nowhere. 80% comes out of nowhere. A priori knowing your noise is often feasible, but not always. X, the presumed effect size you have to magically know before you run your experiment, comes out of nowhere. Getting this right is crucial to a reliable experiment, and it needs to really reflect your prior belief, even though it&#x27;s frequentist. It&#x27;s totally subjective.<p>What&#x27;s worse is that X is often taken to be whatever leads to a feasible&#x2F;fundable experiment that&#x27;ll be done fast enough, not anything scientific.<p>It&#x27;s waaay harder to understand the impact of the subjective 5%&#x2F;80%&#x2F;X decisions than it is to understand the impact of your prior. A prior takes way less training. Better yet, you can report your results assuming many different priors and let your reader subjectively decide what to think, so you don&#x27;t have to commit as hard.<p>tl;dr The &quot;gold standard&quot; way of doing science is already really subjective and that&#x27;s okay. Equally subjective alternatives can still be better science."

"Characters in fiction regularly behave sub-optimally even if they&#x27;re set up as geniuses, for the most mundane meta reason: It&#x27;s a work of entertainment, and the plot wouldn&#x27;t get interesting otherwise! We should always be very aware that any fiction, even ones that attempt speculative simulations, is always shackled by the need to keep being entertaining and interesting -- there are craptons of concepts and possibilities that _can_ occur or _will_ become deeply relevant to humanity but hardly ever gets explored in fiction because they&#x27;re boring to read or write about."

"We read her book Song of Solomon in my senior high school English class. It was one of my favorites of the class, along with Catch-22.

"This is a replay of a comment I wrote several years ago to the same topic:<p>I&#x27;m 60+. I&#x27;ve been coding my whole career and I&#x27;m still coding. Never hit a plateau in pay, but nonetheless, I&#x27;ve found the best way to ratchet up is to change jobs which has been sad, but true - I&#x27;ve left some pretty decent jobs because somebody else was willing to pay more. This has been true in every decade of my career.
There&#x27;s been a constant push towards management that I&#x27;ve always resisted. People I&#x27;ve known who have gone into management generally didn&#x27;t really want to be programming - it was just the means to kick start their careers. The same is true for any STEM field that isn&#x27;t academic. If you want to go into management, do it, but if you don&#x27;t and you&#x27;re being pushed into it, talk to your boss. Any decent boss wants to keep good developers and will be happy to accomodate your desire to keep coding - they probably think they&#x27;re doing you a favor by pushing you toward management.<p>I don&#x27;t recommend becoming a specialist in any programming paradigm because you don&#x27;t know what is coming next. Be a generalist, but keep learning everything you can. So far I&#x27;ve coded professionally in COBOL, Basic, Fortran, C, Ada, C++, APL, Java, Python, PERL, C#, Clojure and various assembly languages each one of which would have been tempting to become a specialist in. Somebody else pointed out that relearning the same thing over and over in new contexts gets old and that can be true, but I don&#x27;t see how it can be avoided as long as there doesn&#x27;t exist the &quot;one true language&quot;. That said, I&#x27;ve got a neighbor about my age who still makes a great living as a COBOL programmer on legacy systems.<p>Now for the important part if you want to keep programming and you aren&#x27;t an academic. If you want to make a living being a programmer, you can count on a decent living, but if you want to do well and have reasonable job security you&#x27;ve got to learn about and become an expert in something else - ideally something you&#x27;re actually coding. Maybe it&#x27;s banking, or process control, or contact management - it doesn&#x27;t matter as long as it&#x27;s something. As a developer, you are coding stuff that&#x27;s important to somebody or they wouldn&#x27;t be paying you to do it. Learn what you&#x27;re coding beyond the level that you need just to get your work done. You almost for certain have access to resources since you need them to do your job, and if you don&#x27;t figure out how to get them. Never stop learning."

"Redesign reducing visibility of donation button, and no real support for selling &#x2F; monetizing your extensions in the stores: totally agreed, they can and likely should do better there.

Or other popular extensions.  Plus they&#x27;re a non-profit, so their cash-in-hand isn&#x27;t too likely to change dramatically, unless we can convince more companies to donate (which could allow donating to extension devs)."

"Some unrelated (to each other) comments.  1. These trapping effects already exist when people won’t quit an otherwise disadvantageous job because of medical benefits.  2. A leasehold is not entirely one-sided in our system.  It is designed to confer the full benefits of property ownership to the lessor, for a given amount of time, in return for the lessor’s paying of rent.  All the Alexa-like machinations described seem to be modifications of the way rent is paid.  3. The book Surveillance Capitalism, by Shoshana Zuboff, attempts to quantify various forms of forward value extracted from consumers by social media and intelligence gathering platforms."

"They&#x27;re also failing to support users, as hinted by the article. The fact that developers are able to simply hand over control of extensions to a third party, who are going to do god knows what with it, without the user being informed at all, is ridiculous.<p>I have a few extensions with 10-100,000 users and have received many emails from people asking to buy one. The numbers in the article seem accurate - if you have 100,000 users you could be looking at offers for tens of thousands of dollars. So, it&#x27;s no surprise that developers cave in and compromise their users&#x27; security."

"I’ve found it’s easy to get much better performance in CPython by simply replacing their malloc with my own. Mine allocates a large block of memory on the stack, then pulls from it. Won’t work for large programs, but for smaller scripts it’s a good amount faster. I think this is because CPython makes something like 1000 malloc calls just to startup, so if those can be made ~instant you get a lot of benefit."
"Also, when you run low on memory, iptables can crash on you:

"Pretty sure that in my country Western imported hearing aids start around 300 or 500 dollars—mostly European ones. And afaik those aren&#x27;t the ‘just blare at 5x the volume’ type but tuned by the audiologist to the patient&#x27;s hearing profile. And they go behind the ear.<p>2000 bucks are the type with a dozen advanced effects, bluetooth connection to work as music player headphones, and adjustable with a remote or an app.<p>So, people in the US might find it cheaper to order European aids or smuggle something from Canada. (BTW, afaik plane tickets cost way less if you buy them in the airport just before the flight.)<p>----<p>Also, personally I&#x27;d be wary of twiddling the params of a hearing aid since I&#x27;m not an audiologist nor any kind of doctor at all and don&#x27;t know if my choice would cause more damage in the long term. And <i>if</i> audiologists mostly reside at hearing aid dealerships then I&#x27;m not sure they will just give you a chart of your hearing so you can walk home and tune your aid by it.<p>Ah, and azalemeth&#x27;s comment reminds me: if the board just has jacks for headphones then you can&#x27;t even use the hearing charts without also knowing the frequency response for the headphones."

"This reminds me of a talk I watched with Peter Thiel and Eric Schmidt. I know Thiel is controversial, but he was well-meaningly digging at Google for running out of ideas and no longer innovating.<p>The criticism was something like &quot;You have so much cash on hand but no ideas to invest in.

"Just to clarify: this article is against <i>gold standards</i>, not against <i>peer review</i>. It concludes by observing that peer review is a necessity. The argument it raises is that peer review doesn&#x27;t mean what lay audiences think it means.<p>I think they&#x27;re clearly correct, and that even on HN, in a community that (roughly) prides itself on being scientifically literate, there are broad misunderstandings of what peer review means (during the bogus &quot;Sokal Squared&quot; hoax, for instance, many commenters implied that peer review prior to publication was meant to encompass replication). Also, while I&#x27;m not a &quot;scientist&quot;, I&#x27;ve gotten to do some peer review work for ACM and Usenix, and even in the little bit of review I did, I seen some shit.

"This is the same argument cake shops make against taking order from gay people. I do believe that so-called manifesto is mind-numbingly dumb, fact-free and it is dangerous in the sense it will inspire more violence against innocent people. But that precisely what makes it a good test case for asking some fundamental questions. Can commercial businesses with deep reach, pricing power and critical function deny services based on their ideology and beliefs? The legal answer is yes and that only looks troublesome when you think of how tables could turn in future.

Just recently came across it and it addresses many of the topics in this thread.<p>&quot;We live in a society where kids and parents are obsessed with early achievement, from getting perfect scores on SATs to getting into Ivy League colleges to landing an amazing job at Google or Facebook–or even better, creating a startup with the potential to be the next Google or Facebook or Uber. We see software coders becoming millionaires or even billionaires before age 30 and feel we are failing if we are not one of them.<p>But there is good news. A lot of us–most of us–do not explode out of the gates in life. That was true for author Rich Karlgaard, who had a mediocre academic career at Stanford (which he got into by a fluke), and after graduating, worked as a dishwasher, night watchman, and typing temp before finally finding the inner motivation and drive that ultimately led him to start up a high-tech magazine in Silicon Valley, and eventually to become the publisher of Forbes magazine.
There is a scientific explanation for why so many of us bloom later in life. The executive function of our brains don’t mature until age 25–and later for some. In fact, our brain’s capabilities peak at different ages. We actually enjoy multiple periods of blooming in our lives.<p>Based on several years of research, personal experience, and interviews with neuroscientists and psychologists, and countless people at different stages of their careers, Late Bloomers reveals how and when we achieve full potential–and why an algorithmic acuity in math is such an anomaly in terms of career success.&quot;"

"Well I’m already a few years into my plan B which became working for gov. This article assumes that government tech is static but it is changing rather quickly. I’m knocking on the door of 40 and regarded as one of the younger leads. My commute is a 6 minute walk home and the high quality projects sometimes get scheduled out for completion in between 3-6 months or even a year if it’s a big one. Medical care and family time for all devs is a huge priority for management. Lots of vacation time, amazing benefits, and employer matched savings (or pension if you go that route). I’ve worked for a startup before and for a big corp as well but feel more secure now. Also, there is a tech allowance fund for equipment for home use and if you want to take classes part time they pay for some of the tuition. They pay for training and events (room and board, food, transportation). I’ve nearly doubled my salary since I started. I also get to mentor recent grads at times one of whom just got a position with Mozilla. So there ya go- with all the negativity this topic invokes there CAN be a silver lining (just like silver hairs beginning to appear on my head). For the younger devs: whenever you get tired of the ‘culture fit’ shenanigans or feel like you are more playing a role like an actor than solving real problems you may find yourself in my shoes. Whenever you get tired of practically living with ‘the team’ knowing that your reward for good work is even more caffeine you may find yourself wanting to get off the tilt-a-whirl just like I did. That day may come where you actually want to have your own uninterrupted thoughts as you work— then it’s time for Plan B."

"On a related note, 8chan has both a Tor&#x2F;hidden service version and a ZeroNet version, and there are ads going around on how to access those.<p>So it&#x27;s clear the folks running the site knew that something like this might happen, and set up alternatives (on &#x27;uncensorable&#x27; services) to provide access in such a situation.<p>It may provide for an interesting case study in whether a community site like this moving to P2P services or Tor can maintain the same level of activity as on the clearweb, or whether that effectively hides it for a decent percentage of the userbase."
"Same happened to me. A few years back, I got an offer from Amazon after going through the interview pipeline and the non-compete and outside-of-work IP assignment were the only thing I asked to be changed since they were draconian given Amazon&#x27;s wide breadth of products. They declined to make the change so I declined to accept their offer.<p>In general, Amazon doesn&#x27;t make positive impressions on potential employees by saying &quot;work for us and we could easily prevent you from working anywhere else for a year and a half (and please trust us that we won&#x27;t)&quot;."

"I have that beat, as I once made Google perform a 30-second query.  I know exactly how I did it, too.  I wasn&#x27;t sure whether or not it would find it...<p>So how does Google do a query?  Well fundamentally it has lists of sites that have a keyword, so it gets the list for each of your keywords, then finds the intersection of those lists, then sorts it by the pagerank of the resulting URL&#x27;s.  That&#x27;s how it used to work anyway.<p>So back in the day I decided to try to do a test.  I got the Gutenberg list of all of Shakespeare&#x27;s words, and I wrote a program to go through it to find the longest string of all &quot;stop&quot; words (which you could still force Google to include - normally it ignores them, since there are just too many sites that include words like &quot;the&quot; and so on).  Stop words are super common words like &quot;the&quot; which would be on millions or billions of pages.  A huge list of URL&#x27;s.<p>So I coded up my little algorithm that goes word by word through the text, keeping track of what the longest string it found so far is, that consisted entirely of stop words.<p>The longest string it found was: &quot;from what it is to a&quot;.<p>Just now I again did that query, and on the whole Internet it just found 4 matches (soon it will find this comment too and any archives of this comment), all being the exact phrase from Shakespeare:<p><a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;lvU1QSs"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;lvU1QSs</a><p>Impressively, that query now takes 0.84 seconds (I haven&#x27;t done that query in several years, it&#x27;s possibly cached but I doubt it.)<p>However, when I first performed it, it took 30+ seconds.  I didn&#x27;t take a screenshot but I was super impressed.  I brought Google to a crawl for 30 seconds, in the exact way I was intending.  Moohahahahaha.<p>&quot;Holy cow.  I just made Google&#x27;s databases join six lists each with millions of pages on them, find the intersection, and then go through all of them for which ones had my phrase in literal order.  And then it found it.&quot;<p>Pretty mind-blowing that today it can do that in &lt; 1 second."
"I totally thought the article was going to be about prolog. Datalog was formulated as a subset of prolog. Prolog generalizes datalog, and is functional, etc. So generalizing a language that was the subset of a larger one in the first place is something I find odd."

"The problem I have with all of these regex websites and tools is that they usually only use the regex dialect of whatever language they’re written in. Or at best, a very incomplete list of dialects.

"It&#x27;s not only the average&#x2F;median that&#x27;s bad, it&#x27;s the lower percentiles that are the most embarrassing.

It wasn&#x27;t only their street that was affected, but the whole part of town, including a newly developed (but mostly empty, what a surprise) business park built from EU development grants. In my mind the reason for disasters like this is a mixture of<p>1. De facto monopoly of the state-owned telecom provider suffering from mind boggling not-invented here syndrome. They&#x27;ve been pushing their proprietary custom-built hardware and protocols for decades while the world largely moved to china-built commodity which is orders of magnitude cheaper.<p>2. Political resistance against declaring broadband as an essential utility. There was a parliamentary vote in 2011 to declare a right for households&#x2F;businesses to get broadband connections (as is the case for electricity&#x2F;sewers&#x2F;telephone). It was declined with votes of the conservative&#x2F;liberal coalition at the time. Nobody even talks about this anymore, other culture war topics seem more important nowadays. Whether to allow wolves to be hunted seems like a more important topic  in the national debates.<p>3. In general there seems to be an unfortunate climate of hostility against technology that reminds me of the Luddites. Smart phones and laptops are banned in high schools, etc. People mostly focus on the dangers and downsides of technology vs the benefits.<p>Source: Born in Germany, I moved to California a few years ago and can see the difference."

I love seeing more Ruby implementations! Looking forward to seeing how it will progress. Are there any details on how it’s implemented? How does it execute Ruby? Does it have its own bytecode? Does it compile to machine code on the fly? What will make it faster than MRI?

"I always remind myself that Paul Gauguin started painting for the first time at 35, and almost at 40 decided to stop being a wealthy stock broker to live as a painter. Regardless of the ethics of that decision (he did leave everyone in his family behind, after all) I do think it&#x27;s pretty impressive that he picked up a profession like that so late and developed it in such an impressive way (I love his artwork, I think it&#x27;s incredibly beautiful)."

"I love reading, but only a handful of books have really changed the way I look at the world. The Bluest Eye was one of them.<p>Minor spoiler: in the bluest eye a young black girl obsesses over a white female doll with blue eyes. Before I read it, I never considered the impact that the idealization of white beauty could have on minorities. After reading that book, I realized how important it was for children to be able to look up to role models (fictional or otherwise) that look like them.<p>In my own life, I have had my own share of fantasy role models (I am a huge Tolkien fan, and when I was younger I loved all things fantasy) that shaped my own identity, and after reading The Bluest Eye I had to consider the idea: how would those books have affected me if all characters looked nothing like me? I do not think the effect would have been positive."
"I feel like the article misses out on two crucial truths:<p>1. Most of the new tools are pure nightmare to maintain. RoR has breaking API changes often enough that you need multiple people to maintain a large codebase, whereas in PHP you&#x27;d only need one person because things don&#x27;t magically break that often. And MongoDB is so convoluted and complicated that almost nobody can deploy it correctly. And then there&#x27;s &quot;new&quot; container techniques, which are basically just an admission that you have no f*ing clue on how to make your new tool set secure. In most cases, the loud new technology is just over-funded hipster stuff, but not ready for the real world yet.<p>2. Posting things online (e.g. Source Code) will not only attract the attention of peers. You might also get flooded with rather demanding emails by technically incompetent people who complain that your free source code release didn&#x27;t solve their problem.<p>Also, I wonder if the author is aware of IRCs ongoing popularity for private development discussion rooms. It seems many people thought Slack was new, but some of us programmers have been hanging out like that since 95."

"Finance 101: Being cash-rich is a major advantage in environments where fundraising is a major hurdle, and where the funds can be put to productive use very quickly. For example, for a startup to raise funds for a major marketing campaign, it has to go through a lengthy and attention-demanding process of pitching to VCs and negotiating terms. Hence why having a big war-chest ready to fire, can be a competitive advantage for a startup.<p>For big public companies, it&#x27;s the opposite. If a company wants to fundraise 10% of its market-cap, either for an acquisition or major investment, it doesn&#x27;t require nearly as much effort. It can issue new shares, and immediately sell them to investors the next day for cash. The hard part is finding profitable investments, not raising the funds to make it happen. Hence why there&#x27;s little competitive advantage in hoarding cash.<p>On the flip side, having a big cash hoard is bad for your investors&#x27; returns. It bloats your market-cap, without having any impact on earnings. This means that your P&#x2F;E ratio is now inflated, and your earnings yield is reduced. From an investor&#x27;s perspective, if you have invested $100 in the company, you&#x27;re only only getting back $6 in profits every year, not $7 or $8.<p>Another way to look at this, is that Google&#x2F;Apple invest their cash hoard very conservatively, in things like short-term treasuries, because of which their returns are very low. Whereas most of their investors would far prefer to invest the money in investments that produce better returns, such as the S&amp;P 500. By not returning the cash hoard to its investors, Google is essentially forcing them to make low-return investments that they would never make otherwise. Of course, investors aren&#x27;t going to be happy with this, and they will retaliate by lowering their valuation of GOOG stock, thus depressing the share price."

"OT: the fullscreen modal on pageload made me want to bounce immediately. But, in good faith, I tried to register. It took like 10 minutes, because required fields (Industry, Company Name, Job Title) automatically cleared in the case of a form submission failure, &quot;Other&quot; categories broke the form, and the user is required to sign up for at least one category of bulk mail, told it&#x27;s &quot;optional&quot;, and given the frequency options &quot;daily&quot;, &quot;weekly&quot;, or &quot;monthly&quot;. If no categories are checked the form submission fails and the form clears half of the fields. The password field gets reset but still appears to be filled, so if the user submits an otherwise correct form the second time the same fields clear again.<p>A new visitor is visually assaulted before even seeing the linked article (e.g. evaluating your site).

"It doesn&#x27;t help that German politicians think it&#x27;s a good idea to let companies bid on frequencies - 5g frequencies just went for 5.5 billion to 4 large companies.

"From the study:<p>&gt; This finding appears to contradict an earlier report by Windham et al. [32] that showed that lower levels of oestriol in second trimester were modestly associated with a later diagnosis of autism in the offspring. However, our samples correspond to a slightly earlier time point in pregnancy compared to Windham et al. (mean gestational week = 14.9 vs. 17.2 respectively) (see Table 1) [32], which could potentially better capture the steroid surge during the PMW [14]. Furthermore, our samples are of different origin, as Windham et al. assayed maternal serum, rather than foetal amniotic fluid. Steroid hormone levels in maternal serum do not differ relative to the baby’s sex and do not correlate to amniotic levels during the PMW [42].<p>So, high levels in blood reduce the autism risk and in amniotic fluid it&#x27;s the other way around? I&#x27;ll wait for a replication, I think"

"I would frame things a little differently. Light makes a lot of mistakes because the Death note is incredibly powerful and there would be almost no reasonable way for L to catch Light without Light making obvious mistakes (and would also make for a boring story). Undoubtedly, the biggest mistake Light makes is revealing the existence of the Death Note, and all the rules therein, which not only gives L (almost) all the information he needs, but also traps him from any subsequent activity.<p>Without knowing the rules of the Death Note, I don&#x27;t think L could have done anything (besides outright abducting&#x2F;murdering Light) to stop Light, even if he is 100% sure Light is &quot;responsible&quot;.<p>That said, I feel like a much simpler solution than what&#x27;s proposed at the end of the essay is:<p>1. Gather up the names you want to write over the course of a week.
2. Wait another week, then write it at a specific point of time of the week.
3. Keep to that schedule.<p>The names need to be as public and as well known as possible such that it would be impossible to trace the flow of information. (Remember, the goal is fear, not specificity.) Keeping to that schedule means you will never leak more information thereafter."

That makes throughput really critical for us: our typical PoC concludes within about 4—6 weeks.[1] Sometimes this is an evaluation of a vendored product, most times it&#x27;s building out our own in-house solution from FOSS components.<p>Current stack: Python, React, AWS, Linux, Docker&#x2F;Kubernetes, TensorFlow<p>What we offer: competitive compensation; full medical&#x2F;dental&#x2F;vision; 401(k); unlimited PTO; no dress code<p>Reach out to me directly at &lt;christopher.wetherill@stateauto.com&gt; if interested<p>[0] --- <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dispatch.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;20180422&#x2F;state-auto-ceo-readies-insurer-for-wave-of-change"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dispatch.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;20180422&#x2F;state-auto-ceo-readie...</a>

"&quot;The point is that we have good reason to be skeptical, and we should follow the mantra of the mathematician (and Bayesian) Pierre-Simon Laplace, that extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. By ignoring the necessity of priors, significance testing opens the door to false positive results.&quot;<p>Such an important quote. I believe the replication crisis is especially present in nutrition studies. We live in an age where headlines go viral and new wave diets are taken on in rapid succession.

"In your readme, could you add a mention of memcached and how you differ?"
As the author&#x2F;maintainer of a once popular text editor I feel it is easy to get started then very hard to finish. Modern text editors require a lot of details and even more demands from those who use it. It’s a fun programming challenge. I still find myself thinking about awesome features to add.
"Life Sciences VCs that incubate and spin-out their own companies put serious muscle behind the startups, in two main areas: money and leadership. The article notes the first, going on to suggest large upfront financing is no longer necessary, but glosses over the second. In biotech it is still very much the status quo to have seasoned execs leading startups. Not because younger founders are incapable, but rather this is what pharma execs want to see, and have connections with. It&#x27;s hard enough for a startup to get pilots and deals with pharmacos, exponentially so if the founders just took CS 270 with the CEO&#x27;s grandkid."
"If you&#x27;re affecting startup employees&#x27; (and prospectives&#x27;) perceptions of compensation, how do you deal with the appearance of potential conflict of interest, as a YC startup (which presumably has an interest in hiring and compensation by its startups)?<p>Also, do you have some kind of official fiduciary obligation, as part of giving financial advice?  And if so, to whom?<p>How will giving financial advice mesh with offering financial products?<p>(I mean these questions constructively, and I figure you have good intentions.  These are merely the kinds of questions that come to my finance layperson&#x27;s mind.)"

"As governments seem slow to action, would coordinating consumers shopping help combat the monopoly power of some industry? For example, having an app that notifies you to try and buy from a competitor like walmart for a few days to pressure amazon into bargaining?"
Perhaps keeping it separate is a good thing technically.<p>DoorDash app and website are a dumpster fire with usability and bugs galore.<p>The issue is as a user is if you bring this up to DoorDash support they have no internal process for handling reported issues with the app and website and letting the development team know.

These are YC style biotech startups which I don&#x27;t think have played out yet.  The traditional approach raises a few million to get to phase 1 and then usually gets bought if the data looks promising. Many of these have pharma partnerships and&#x2F;or investment.  Sometimes they IPO earlier to get some outside capital.  What&#x27;s good about that is that the public can get in on it sooner.  The bio side is very much driven by academia and spin offs.

"I hit this bug yesterday on my laptop (16GB of RAM &#x2F; 1GB of swap) with 2 instances of Firefox (about 60 tabs), Slack, Insomnia (Electron-based Postman clone) and a couple of `node` processes watching and transpiling.. stuff. `kswapd0` was running at 100% CPU, I guess trying to free up some RAM by moving things to swap (the swap partition was full by this point).

Chrome and Google not caring or supporting these kind of things I get but Firefox&#x27;s recent efforts seem to be either gross negligence or targeted moved to destroy their addon ecosystem.<p>I thought Firefox was going to get better with their redesign but it seems like it just resulted in lost functionality. Their misguided quest to get more market share has been a completely failure and pushed anyone who valued their customizable experience away.
"I&#x27;m wary of Amazon since they have a terrible reputation for tech work in addition to warehouse and delivery work. People who I&#x27;ve talked to who work there have not entirely refuted this for me.<p>Non-compete agreements are garbage and are unfortunately very common - I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised to find them at Google, Apple, etc.. Employment contracts are usually &quot;take it or leave it&quot; in that regard, though personally I try to cross out everything I disagree with before signing one.<p>I&#x27;m surprised it&#x27;s even legal to require employees to sign an agreement preventing them from quitting to work for a competitor. It seems like just the sort of violation of freedom to work, and a harmful restriction of the labor market, that should be illegal under labor law.<p>Like all employment agreements, it&#x27;s also absurdly asymmetrical. Imagine this &quot;if the company ends your employment for any reason, company agrees not to compete with you or your next employer in any way - including but not limited to products, services, and labor - for a period of 18 months subsequent to the end of your employment.&quot; No sane company would agree to this, since they would effectively have to shut down for 18 months (and lose 18 months of income.) But they are perfectly OK enforcing such an agreement on their employees."
"The fact that you go mostly &quot;unseen&quot; online seems completely orthogonal to whether you love programming and keep up with the latest technologies, etc. I would consider myself &quot;dark matter&quot; in the respect that no one knows who I am and I&#x27;m not constantly blogging or tweeting about stuff. That doesn&#x27;t mean I&#x27;m not interested in, passionate about and highly competent in technology. I find it kind of insulting actually that someone would assume that just because I&#x27;m not loud about it means anything else about how much I care about it or how good at it I am. I&#x27;m not totally surprised by this though; for most people, if you&#x27;re not jumping up and down telling them about how awesome you are they have no way of knowing. I see this a lot in my current job; all the developers know which of their colleagues are kick-ass at their jobs, but you have to sell yourself and your accomplishments to everyone else.<p>TL;DR, I know this is an old article, but it seems there&#x27;s still some perception that us dark matter folks are all just passionless drones in it for the paycheck, and while there&#x27;s surely some percentage of us for which that&#x27;s true, I think it&#x27;s completely wrong-headed to assume that&#x27;s how we all are."

"Personally I think this is sort of missing the forest for the trees.  The big picture is, Mozilla and Google don&#x27;t like extensions or extension developers.  They don&#x27;t like people customizing their browsers.  We see feature after feature drop from being a button in the menu, to being an option in the about:config, to requiring an extension, to requiring manual modification of files, to being entirely disabled.<p>Look at something as simple as putting the tabs below the address bar.  If Mozilla respected their users, it would be as simple as hitting the Customize button and then dragging the tab bar to the bottom.  Then they stuck it in an about:config option.  Then they required you to make a custom userChrome.css.  Now guess what, in the newest version userChrome.css loading is disabled by default and you have to manually turn it back on.  How long it will take before it&#x27;s entirely disabled?  I have no idea, but the message from Mozilla is clear: &quot;You can use it the way we want you to or you can go to hell&quot;."

"Thanks for the reminder.  I have a sprawling mess in my basement and have only done wire lacing once (it&#x27;s trivial to do well, a little harder to do obnoxiously well) and had forgotten about lacing them -- it&#x27;s perfect!<p>I used to work in Telecom and I remember when I first saw a monstrosity of laced wiring.  This was at a (staffed) phone switch (raised floor, all hardware and technicians) so there was an amazing amount of wiring and I recall admiring the cleanliness of everything (there&#x27;s a point at which the various colors of running wire, perfectly laced, is a very interesting piece of modern art).  The wires weren&#x27;t done by an amateur; each cable was lined up -- it looked as though there was a harness specifically designed for the bundles of wires that placed them perfectly parallel (or perpendicular when one ran off of the bundle).<p>I made an off-hand remark about how long it must have taken to do all of that and was informed from the ops guy that they had just completed it last month.  Prior, it had been partially laced, partially tied and generally &quot;clean-but-haphazard&quot;, however, the switch had just brought in a new manager and somewhere between his first and second day he went on tear through the switch and demanded it be corrected on the short-order.  So over about 8 months, every run was separated and laced[0].  Frankly, I would have been proud if any of my personal equipment were as well maintained as the &quot;before&quot; pictures, but the difference after lacing made the &quot;before&quot; look like spaghetti by comparison.<p>The benefits are huge, though, for anyone who has encountered a run of wire with heavy-duty zip-ties and a misplaced set of clippers[1].  You can lace wires about as fast as a zip-tie if you&#x27;re only aiming for &quot;good enough&quot;, but you can rip through and redo laced wires with a car key or something that is far less likely to slice a wire.<p>[0] ...according to the tech, &quot;Twice&quot;; they really didn&#x27;t like the new manager.  I&#x27;ve never seen a lace job this excellent -- it wasn&#x27;t a bundle of clean wires, it was a perfect rectangle of multiple laced wires laced together with each loop&#x2F;knot hit with a low-temp heat gun to strengthen the knot (which -- while I can&#x27;t speak to how much value it really adds strength-wise, it had the effect of making the looped&#x2F;knotted spots look really straight and clean.<p>[1] I must own thirty pairs of clippers of various sizes&#x2F;shapes purchased for the sole purpose of cutting zip ties.  I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;re all in a container ... somewhere ... all together.  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever had one available to me when I actually need it."

"It&#x27;s also worth noting where the terms &quot;UCS-2&quot; and &quot;UCS-4&quot; come from.  For a while there was the idea of the Universal Coded Character Set[0] as an <i>alternative</i> to Unicode.  This would have been a natively 32-bit encoding.  However, it wouldn&#x27;t have allowed the full 2^32 possible characters, because of its insistence that none of the 4 bytes could be any of the C0 or C1 controls.  Still, it would have about 2^29 possible characters as opposed to Unicode&#x27;s about 2^21.<p>But the insistence on avoiding C0 and C1 controls would have led to some odd codepoint numbers, and definite incompatibility with ASCII and Unicode; for instance, &#x27;A&#x27;, instead of 0x41, would have been 0x20202041!  Whereas Unicode of course made sure to copy ASCII (indeed, to copy ISO-8859-1) for its first block.<p>Of course, this didn&#x27;t come to pass because, well, people were already supporting 16-bit Unicode and didn&#x27;t want to switch <i>again</i>.  And I&#x27;m kind of glad it didn&#x27;t -- while it would have meant not having to deal with the compromise that is UTF-16, imagine living in a world where &#x27;A&#x27; is not 0x41, but rather 0x20202041!  (Or imagine opening up a text file and finding three spaces between each character...)<p>[0]<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Universal_Coded_Character_Set"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Universal_Coded_Character_Set</a>"

"Nice resource.

"So this has mostly to do with a non-complete clause. The author is pretty explicit in their view:<p>&gt; This clause is, to be direct, abusive.<p>As far as I&#x27;m aware this is something that has been apparent for quite some time, and isn&#x27;t limited to just Amazon. I can&#x27;t personally conceive of why anyone subject to one of these would have any reason to believe that this isn&#x27;t just another tool that benefits the company alone, and could perhaps even be used against you.<p>A discussion about clauses such as this is well needed in general, not just the tech industry. Honestly, the real story that perhaps has more relevancy to tech is having (as the author correctly recognizes) the kind of privilege to turn down a job with Amazon.

Parisians who work and commute by public transit spend an average of 116 minutes a day on public transit: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thelocal.fr&#x2F;20160418&#x2F;parisians-spend-23-days-a-year-on-public-transport"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thelocal.fr&#x2F;20160418&#x2F;parisians-spend-23-days-a-y...</a>.<p>Viewed from a different perspective, a country where most people can spend 48 minutes a day commuting, because it’s rich enough for everyone to afford a car,[1] might be considered better than one where many people have to endure two-hour public transit commutes. Maybe utopia isn’t Paris, with rich people living in beautiful walkable downtowns, but rather Houston, where middle class people can afford big houses with a pool and a short, direct commute.<p>[1] The median disposable income per US household is a staggering 50% higher than for a French household."

"The opposite also happens, where the uninsured price is a lot more than the insured price.<p>I was in this sort of situation once.  I needed a CT scan, but it was on a late friday afternoon, and the hospital couldn&#x27;t get prior approval from the insurance company.  They quoted one price that they would bill the insurance company if it was approved, and another much larger priced that I would have to pay if the insurance company rejected the claim.  (I ended up getting the CT scan the next day at a hospital that charged a lot less.  I think it was covered by insurance.)<p>The thing about this that&#x27;s bad is that it&#x27;s over-charging the people least likely to be able to repay, and (if they can come up with the cash) they&#x27;re effectively subsidizing the insured customers.  This is the other side of narrative that poor people are driving up health care costs for everyone else because they don&#x27;t pay their bills."

A thought in the back of my mind is fear of government oppression in a world without prevalent cars.<p>If you have a car you can travel hundreds of miles with few limitations and it&#x27;s particularly hard to quash this even in an oppressive state.<p>If you only have your feet and public transit you are very limited to distance and location and tracking movements is an easy feature of the system.  Things going wrong? The government can shut down the trains at whim.<p>A car grants a whole lot of freedom that many progressive people are really excited to give away.

It&#x27;s a psychologically hazardous job, and it gets no fanfare.<p>It doesn&#x27;t help that the relationship between customers and businesses is so often just directly antagonistic, customer service isn&#x27;t something that businesses want to do, it&#x27;s something they have to do.

There&#x27;s a reason people hate working CS and retail; it can be legitimately traumatic, and they often have to find themselves being the friendly face pasted over an uncaring machine.<p>For all the hate that open offices get, I appreciate the fact that my desk is within earshot of CS taking phone calls.

"Probably, system administration or the rest of IT is the closest to a natural fit for a programmer going into other things. For people with the MS programming certifications this may be a pretty clear path and aided by their programming skills.<p>I’ve got family who seemingly bucked this problem, though. He has maybe going on 40 years of C experience, now. I think he’s said it’s become harder to find work that really needs his skillset, but he’s been doing the contractor thing for much of that time and always kept employed."

"I&#x27;m self taught and have been doing this for 20 years. Most of that in a sort of survival serial startup mode that eventually stabilized into me having a clue around the time I turned 30.<p>I got hired a few years ago for a senior dev&#x2F;architect&#x2F;ops + engineering manager position at a ~5 person startup despite the fact that I was &quot;a bad culture fit&quot; because most of the staff was phds or masters level educated. At the time I found it really offensive that they&#x27;d even say that. The CEO said in the same breath &quot;I think hiring you is the closest thing I&#x27;ll get to cloning myself.&quot; Talk about mixed signals!<p>As it turns out, that assessment was solidly right. They were entrenched in policies and behavior that basically guaranteed a tragic failure. And because of those policies the rescue from mistakes always fell on my doorstep well past when it would be trivial to solve the problem. This created a horrifically unpredictable work environment.<p>All and all, it was a growth experience and I probably gave the company a year of life it wouldn&#x27;t have had otherwise. I would never take another job where that was said to me though."

"I recently moved to Germany. I used to work as a software dev in India before this. I was horrified to learn that (urban) India has way better internet than Germany. When it comes to mobile data it&#x27;s even more depressing - back in India I used to get 1.5GB  _daily_ 4G mobile data for 200 rupees (around 2.5 euros) a _month_. Even after adjusting for purchasing power, 2.5 euros a month for virtually unlimited mobile data is super cheap. In comparison, I pay 10 euros a month for a _monthly_ quota of 1.5 GB with O2 here in Germany. Not to mention that it&#x27;s slower, and yes, there are a lot of patches with no data reception.
Considering that Germany has otherwise superb infrastructure, the internet was a let down."

"This was my preteens&#x2F;teens. What a rush that was! Seeing all of those groups&#x2F;logos and I was on half those sites, and the transition from BBS&#x27;s to the dawn of the internet, or at least when it started to be used by the public. My fav BBS was Fear and Loathing (in Las Vegas). It had a ton of LD lines to connect to, which was important since it could take many hours to DL a single game as they grew in size&#x2F;spanning multiple disks, so the lines were full a lot. I learned a lot of area codes lol, as you could usually tell which BBS&#x27;s were good ones based on the city they were in on the BBS lists. So many hours spent tweaking connection string parameters on the good ol US Robotics to make it dial faster, pause less in between tones, etc., so you could try to connect to a board faster. It was almost like you were hacking the BBS just to connect to it (redialing over and over lol). There wasn&#x27;t even caller ID back then, so they couldn&#x27;t prevent you from hammering them. It was like a lottery system whether you connected or not, as hundreds of others were doing the exact same thing at the same time 24&#x2F;7. Oh, and you had to dedicate a lot of your phone line time to hacking LD codes so you could spend the rest of the time phreaking so you could actually connect&#x2F;download without paying LD charges. It took a dedicated phone line. It was always fun when someone else in the house picked up the phone and ruined your download.

"I&#x27;ve noticed there are SO many of these &quot;coding interview prep&quot; courses lately. Like, obviously it&#x27;s a hot job market, but there&#x27;s just so many and of a certain vibe that it seems like some are selling a dream.<p>There&#x27;s a common narrative too, that it&#x27;s all about algorithm question prep and it&#x27;s a &quot;game&quot; you can win. One youtuber who recently landed a ~$275K TC gig said it&#x27;s not about being &quot;intelligent&quot; it&#x27;s about practice and rapid pattern recognition (he also was pitching his own coding interview prep course). Said he forgot half of it after getting the job.<p>This could all be true but this narrative is coming from sources that have a financial interest in making you believe that. What do you think HN? I mean I know algorithm prep is an important part of the interview but.. there&#x27;s just something sketch about all these outfits I can&#x27;t quite put my finger on.<p>(I also wonder if the people who get hired based on prep vs. aptitude then have a kind of survivor bias and hire others who are strong on this limited range of pattern recognition... could it be a problem for the industry?)"
There are far greater things to be worried about.

"I really cannot concur. I live in the depths of Bavaria in a small village with ~2000 residents. Our apartment is connected by two 100MBit&#x2F;s DSL and 500MBit&#x2F;s Cable lines, set up in failover configuration in case one goes down (which always only happens on Cable for a few minutes, and that setup exists only because I work 100% remote). The village is located in a mountainous region, yet everywhere I go, I have +100Mbit&#x2F;s LTE available, safe for the completely unpopulated areas between mountains.<p>For all of this I pay<p>- 39,99 for the cable
 - 29,99 for the DSL
 - 30,00 for unlimited LTE<p>On the other hand, there are very small villages with population &lt; 500 with only 10 or 20Mbit&#x2F;s DSL available. However, I think that this is to be expected in these areas and any complaint about it is, at least in this day and age, a first world problem and your own fault for living in the middle of nowhere."

"This is a great post and so spot on. At some point in my career my &#x27;review prep&#x27; (which was the time I spent working on my own evaluation of my year at a company) became answering the question, &quot;Do I still want to work here?&quot; I categorize my &#x27;review&#x27; in four sections (which are each rated at one of five levels, needs improvement, sometimes meets expectations, meets expectations, sometimes exceeds expectations, or consistently exceeds expectations)<p>I start by reviewing how I&#x27;m being managed, I expect someone managing me to be clear in their expectations of my work product, provide resources when I have identified the need to complete jobs, can clearly articulate the problem I am expected to be solving, and can clearly articulate the criteria by which the solution will be evaluated.<p>Second I review my co-workers, using a three axis evaluation, can I trust what they say to be accurate&#x2F;honest, can I count on them to meet their commitments, and are they willing to teach me when I don&#x27;t understand something and conversely learn when their is something they do not know.<p>Third I review what level of support do I get to do my job. Am I provided with a workspace where I can get work done? Do have have the equipment I need to do what is being asked? Is my commute conducive to the hours required? And finally and most important, does this job allow me to balance work obligations and non-work obligations?<p>Fourth I review whether or not the company mission, ethics, and culture is still one that I wish to be a part of. Am I proud of the company&#x27;s mission? Do I believe that the leadership will make ethical calls even if doing so would mean less profit margin? Can I relate to and am I compatible with the values that my co-workers espouse and the actions they take? (this is the &quot;company culture&quot; theme, is it still a company that fits me culturally)<p>A company that receives lower than a 3.0 rating I put on a 90 day &quot;company improvement plan&quot; (CIP). I bring issues to the leadership who are in a position to address the situations that I&#x27;ve found wanting and try to secure their commitment to change. If after 90 days they haven&#x27;t been able to (if they choose not to they&#x27;re done right away), then I &quot;fire&quot; the company and work to process my exit as expeditiously as possible."
"Grubhub&#x27;s process of creating fake websites that compete with the restaurant&#x27;s official site so that they can take a cut of any direct orders is so scummy.<p>I refuse to have anything to do with either company.   I care about my local restaurants, not slimy practices like that."
"What a good list.<p>Most Australians would tell you if you asked them that you can achieve something extraordinary, or begin something new after the age of 35. But I think people are just trying to say the right thing. They know it&#x27;s true in their heads, but I am not sure that their hearts know.<p>I am under the age of 25, so well under 35, and I am hoping to live out this advice, and spend my early years learning to learn, and constantly try out new stuff. But there are very few role models that I can look to in my life who have really kicked off their work at 30 or 35. I suspect this is true for a lot of people (regardless of age). Grandmothers getting degrees is still a quaint, publishable news-story.<p>I would love to hear from any people in the hacker news crowd that have changed careers &#x27;late,&#x27; or intentionally spent their early years taking career&#x2F;skill risks."
"Wait... We must having different definition of perfect. I would say Go is a very good language, and probably be one of the best in terms of simple and practical design, fast execution, fast compilation etc.<p>The perfection, however, is not something Go never meant to be. The perfect language possibly support fully dependent type like Idris while maintains zero abstraction cost like Rust, having precise syntax rule like Lisp, and a powerful runtime like Erlang, and the list goes on.<p>The success of Go lies in it&#x27;s trade-offs, the designers are opinionated, knowing well what they want and what they don&#x27;t, and executes things well in the implementation."

"Wouldn&#x27;t a more effective US strategy against China been to get the EU, Japan, and South Korea in on the tarrifs as well? Might as well throw in Canada and Mexico as well on account of being NAFTA partners. That would account for all of Chinas major trading partners. Japan and SK might have been difficult, but a combined North America + EU might have done the trick.<p>Maybe the Trump Administration tried this, but I find it unlikely since this Administration opened up lambasting our traditional allies. This trade war as it stands is going nowhere. China won&#x27;t budge."

"My favorite bar in Tokyo (in the whole world?) was a place like this, called Track Bar in the Ebisu neighborhood. $8 seating charge, no photos or talking above the music allowed, then you can sit at the bar and drink inexpensive but quality whiskey all night and listen to whatever the bartenders&#x2F;DJs were playing. Lots of rare cuts from the 60s thru the 00s. I also ended up having nice conversations with plenty of other patrons. Most were there for the music as well, a mix of locals and tourists, very friendly vibe. I wish I had a comparable place in NYC.<p>As a side note, the secret to drinking in Japan (or anywhere), known to alcoholics but not to many regular folks, is starting or finishing your night with a little bottle of vitamin C drink. Helps your liver digest the alcohol. I started buying Emergen-C packets when I got back to the States and it&#x27;s been a game-changer. Routine colds also seem to be less intense..."

"The next step is to allow voice&#x2F;touch-driven repositioning of elements that the initial model didn&#x27;t get right, e.g. telling it to &quot;move Submit above Cancel&quot; or just grabbing it and placing it there. That would clear most issues customers have and they could do that themselves, including changing styles&#x2F;themes and seeing how it behaves right away."
Glass is definitely my favorite material to work with. I started messing with it after following the instructions for setting up a lab in “The Golden Book of Chemistry Experements.” (I can’t believe that’s a children’s book haha)
"I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s that disruptive. One thing that the 2009 roadmap for additive manufacturing has emphasized is the need to move from point to line and area deposition[0]. This still scans a point like stereolithography has done since the beginning. We now have stereolithography machines capable of area deposition by using a DMD projector[1], often called DLP, that are approaching manufacturing products at high volume[2]. Some DLP stereolithography machines now have resolution on the order of 10 micrometers over a 160 mm by 50 mm area[2]. We&#x27;re having to develop new ways to describe 3d geometry just so that we can take advantage of this resolution. So there is potential here for both fast and incredibly high resolution using DLP stereolithography. We&#x27;ve also seen the development that the 2009 additive manufacturing roadmap couldn&#x27;t anticipate: volumetric deposition[3].<p>In addition, there are some potential disadvantages to prism scanning. Prism scanning can only do raster scans, we can&#x27;t define the outline of a part in vector mode. Although I will admit that this may not be as much of a problem if we can control the brightness of our laser. In addition, in stereolithography it is advantageous to carry out raster scans perpendicular to each other, this is because the photopolymer contracts as it cures and scanning in both directions helps make this contraction uniform.<p>[0]<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pdfs.semanticscholar.org&#x2F;4716&#x2F;c69f0b90a158589e54248a524a57ad78f4a3.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pdfs.semanticscholar.org&#x2F;4716&#x2F;c69f0b90a158589e54248a...</a>

"My opinion is that freedom of speech is a fine ideal to strive for, but it relies on having a stable society with some minimum level of education (moral and philosophical too, not just the technical kind). It requires people who are able to fully parse the implications of what they are hearing to make sound and rational judgements on the rejection of an idea or the embrace of it. It creates a moral duty for the people who are listening to not only reject, but to actively push back against ideals which are universally understood to be reprehensible.<p>The concept of freedom of speech falls apart if universally reprehensible speech is allowed to be publicaly espoused without being firmly challenged. Forums like 8chan and 4chan effectively incubate hate speech by providing a safe space for anonymized, like-minded individuals to congregate, espouse their basest thoughts and feelings <i>and receive gratification for it</i> -all without challenge. Moderate people are repulsed by such forums and the quantity of hate-speech they generate, which further compounds the negative feedback loop.<p>Unchecked extremism compounded by more unchecked extremism inevitably leads to scenarios like the ones we’re witnessing more and more often."

Vuejs template language is total chaos if you haven’t put in quite a bit of time with vue before, there are 2 or 3 ways to do everything. I am having trouble believing this was auto-generated from a deeply learned model. How do you write css, are you writing sass, vue inline styles, or something vanilla? Are you bundling with with webpack, what custom modules does your webpack use for handling those inline svgs? So so many questions about how and if this was auto generated..."

This is not a result of this affair - but something that already existed. Can we rely on this power always being used for good purposes? I dunno. If you deal with controversial stuff, better have a backup plan. Good thing 8chan were too stupid to have one.<p>Conclusion: the result is good, the path indicates some troubling realities. I often oppose the &#x27;get a good result in a dubious way&#x27; method, but here the balance tilted strongly towards action. My tolerance drops to zero when it comes to terrorist breeding sites and the &#x27;damage&#x27; merely shows us what already existed. There&#x27;s an argument this should have been done much earlier."

So I hope that people will do some research into the history and current use of censorship.<p>The other difficult problem is that people think that their country is an exception to all other countries and history with regards to censorship and everything else.<p>One other issue: corporations that have as much or more centralized power as governments.  In line with the rest of my comment, one reason this is problematic is because it is much easier for governments to assert control over individual companies.  And those policies (sometimes good or sometimes very bad) affect masses of people.<p>It really seems to me that we are moving towards a more homogeneous global political system that honestly appears to be modeled after the Chinese one and will probably be controlled from there."

Mods have continually allowed the proliferation of perspectives that are civilly, socially, and scientifically illiterate and encourage the usage of these platforms without being able to talk about their downsides and their real world effects they have on society.<p>The blind allegiance to a system of ideals that continually shows that there are negative, consistent symptoms and characteristics of those ideals always immediately gets swept under the rug.<p>Then of course the organization or person that finally stands up to hate communities and its platforms gets bombarded with the most asinine opinions on these threads.<p>Some of the most upvoted posts in this thread involve whataboutism on Twitter, ironically usually lambasted for its content moderation policies but in this instance they don&#x27;t go far enough. I guess you can have it both ways to fit a techno-libertarian perspective. And as alluded to previously, in some other upvoted posts cloudflare is accused for doing this just as a PR stunt.<p>Fix your forum.<p>&gt;The unresolved question is how should the law deal with platforms that ignore or actively thwart the Rule of Law? That&#x27;s closer to the situation we have seen with the Daily Stormer and 8chan. They are lawless platforms. In cases like these, where platforms have been designed to be lawless and unmoderated, and where the platforms have demonstrated their ability to cause real harm, the law may need additional remedies. We and other technology companies need to work with policy makers in order to help them understand the problem and define these remedies. And, in some cases, it may mean moving enforcement mechanisms further down the technical stack.<p>Take a hint. Technology companies have a civic responsibility to not act as platforms for radicalization and hate. This includes HN."

"&gt; [Interoperability between all banks has] been one of the arguments for blockchain-based payment systems like Facebook&#x27;s (FB) Libra, which would circumvent the need for third-party payment settlement. During two Congressional hearings on Libra last month, some lawmakers called on the Fed to create a real-time payment system itself rather than having to rely on a network developed by Facebook.<p>It&#x27;s a reminder that blockchain solutions aren&#x27;t as useful if there actually is a trusted central entity, upon whose sterling reputation the global economy relies in the first place, to record transactions. And it does speak to a mission to regulate and facilitate interstate commerce. If they get the branding and execution right this could be huge for enabling micro-entrepreneurship. Of course, they won&#x27;t get it right, but one can dream."

"The problem with pushing right up  to borders of tolerance is that borders shift.  Sometimes suddenly and violently.<p>As I&#x27;d commented a few days ago[1], Google&#x27;s then-CEO Eric Schmidt said &quot;The Google policy on a lot of things is to get right up to the creepy line and not cross it&quot;.<p>The problem with such a policy is in thinking that cultural and legal boundaries are fixed and inviolate. The very process of repeatedly pressing up to a border may trigger the backlash which moves it, and can leave the fate-tempting party in deep water -- with its own culture, processes, amd institutions unable to adapt, or with goodwill so badly burnt it never recovers.<p>In particular, the resource most being burnt is <i>trust</i>, a commodity that&#x27;s expensive to acquire, quick to burn, and that big business in particular has had in short supply for most of the past 50 years[3].  Trust, once earned and deserved, <i>hugely</i> reduces costs of business in that counterparties -- not just customers, but vendors, employees, regulators, and even competitors -- tend to be inclined to cooperate and assist.  And when squandered, makes every interaction (including customer service) a scorched-earth battleground.  The topic is something of an evergreen in the business field, I&#x27;d posted an item recently on it.[4]<p>There are numerous places where customer service gets it wrong, but breakdowns of trust across multiple boundaries is hugely evident:  the company doesn&#x27;t trust its customers, <i>or</i> CSRs, marketing doesn&#x27;t trust manufacturing, sales doesn&#x27;t trust service, engineering doesn&#x27;t trust sales, and more.

"As noted in the article, hydrogen is currently unfortunate, because the most economical way to produce it is through steam reforming of natgas. Germany already has supply issues with natural gas, not just the pressure to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Electrolysis of water is another method, but requires a lot of electricity. Using it in the short term is highly wasteful, when the source fuels could just be used directly.<p>Nonetheless, on a longer timescale, hydrogen effectively becomes a roundabout instrument of space-, time- and demand-shifted energy storage, but potentially bulk-conveyable using portions of existing gas pipeline infrastructure. This compares favorably to batteries (which are heavy, solid, contain other commodities, and are non-bulk-conveyable in a comparable way), and other energy storage schemes (which are immobile or lack effective the distribution of work). It&#x27;s broadly similar to hydrocarbon natgas and syngas, but without the direct release of carbon during actual combustion.<p>The hope in this effort to encourage progress and deployment of hydrogen-based technologies, infrastructure, and business models, and tolerate some short-term wastefulness to target a more favorable goal in the long term."

"This article makes a common mistake: Scrum and Agile are not synonymous. Given that error, the conclusion is nonsense. And besides, even Scrum doesn’t require a delivered product each sprint. Just an updated status and increment completed.<p>If I’m building a new server and client architected system, the early sprints may be getting certain design details down. More documentation than code. Later on, I may have sprints that only establish the handshake between client and server and no real functionality. The point is taking milestones (big chunks of work) down to smaller chunks of work that can establish a clearer goal set for the near future.<p>And that isn’t even unique to Scrum. If you don’t establish small iterative goals it becomes difficult to measure progress. Saying, “We can’t measure success until this large number of lines of code are completed” is folly. If you have that design, you can measure your progress towards completion by creating inch-pebbles for the next few iterations. Like in my example, finalize design docs based on R&amp;D efforts, make prototypes or simulations, create basic handshake code, then build up server and client features in tandem to ensure they make sense (maybe the design can be simplified when you realize several commands or messages are really specialized versions of a more generic one, or maybe something is more complex and requires a reexamination of the design). And yes, a lot of this is common sense to good engineers. Problem is, common sense isn’t common and you’ll get people pushing Waterfall again and again."

"Agile as implemented at almost all companies fails to account for the possibility of software with simple observable interfaces requiring extremely complex and intrinsically non-modular internal design. Most high-end platform infrastructure work looks like this if you are doing it correctly. As a consequence, it becomes difficult-to-impossible to do any kind of hardcore platform software engineering work in most organizations because their model for what successful agile software development should look like doesn&#x27;t allow for it. There is no appetite for software development where there will be no visible progress for many months and demonstrable functionality is extremely backloaded.<p>A related issue is software that cannot be meaningfully prototyped because any design that is reflective of the desired product has the same order of effort as the actual product, for many of the same reasons.<p>There are certain kinds of high-value software that cannot be built inside most tech companies now because it pattern matches so poorly to the way people think &quot;agile&quot; software development should look like."
"I was under the assumption, that Linux and Mac OS (size of(wchar_t)==4, ergo UCS-4, because it was clear from the beginning, that 16bit won&#x27;t do it.

But they went out all the way through the stack.<p>Linux goes for byte stream encoding (e.g utf-8), because it isn&#x27;t (&#x2F;wasn&#x27;t) doing any string processing. So, encoding efficiency beats algorithmic complexity of string operations. If you need an algorithmic more efficient encoding, that&#x27;s up to your application, and ucs-4 was the way to do it."

"That’s funny. I’m some debates related to nuclear power very recently, I had the thought that it’s probably better to focus on using excess power from renewables to generate synthetic gas and simply use the existing gas pipelines and power plants.<p>The world still needs hydrocarbons. They need to be made renewably. That might only be affordable when wind and solar is overproducing, ie we’re getting “free” energy. Producing those hydrocarbons solves a lot of problems, including balancing the power output from those renewable power plants<p>I’m not so sure about hydrogen specifically. It just doesn’t have great properties. It’s just that it’s pretty easy to make renewably. Making synthetic hydrocarbon gases is harder, but it helps capture CO2 (at least temporarily) and is more energy dense and versatile. We also have better hydrogen fuel cells, but that could also change with time. Besides, I think this article was mostly about burning gases.<p>I think this is a good direction for Germany."

Whereas musicians seem to either lose inspiration or interest as they get older, maybe it&#x27;s just a medium that benefits a lot from the enthusiasm and discovery of youth.<p>That being said, I do suspect there will be a much greater number of people emerging at older ages over the next few decades as more people opt to not go down the typical path of obligations and more flexible work situations allow for more time to focus on passions (for those who can afford to not be working all the time)"

"&gt; The elevators, for example, will only take residents from the lobby to the Poor Floors and back if there are zero outstanding requests from the Rich Floors; this effectively forces the lower income residents to either walk thirty flights up to reach their units, or else wait forty minutes at rush hour to use the elevators – a pretty thinly veiled analogy to what happens today with commuting inequality.<p>But here&#x27;s the kicker: the people on the Rich Floors have to pay <i>more</i>, effectively subsidizing the rent of the people on the Poor Floors."

"I&#x27;ve had a sneaking feeling that a lot of the phyto-estrogen compounds out their were eventually going to be linked to autism.

"reCAPTCHA v2 has prevented me from doing so many things. A recent example: I attempted to make a LinkedIn account. When I got to the captcha, it gave me one of the really nasty ones where you wait for each new image square to slowly appear, and almost every new square also contains a bus or whatever it wants me to click. Then after hitting submit, it still thinks I’m a bot, so I get sent back to another captcha, infinitely. I never ended up creating the account. I attribute this to me using ublock and not using google products, but I can’t say for certain, and I’m not changing that just so I can pass a captcha. One of the stated purposes of reCAPTCHA v2 is to prevent actions from taking place altogether by wasting a user&#x2F;bot’s time, so this was probably one of those cases. Somehow it felt certain I was a bot, so to prevent the signup from being possible it instead sent me on an infinite captcha solving tangent. It would have been nice to know before solving tons of them that this would never work and I was just wasting my time."
"I have way too many domain names, but I like it. I have several .uk, .no and .com for my own name, e.g. firstname.tld or firstnamelastname.tld. All redirecting to my main site.<p>For the first decade or two that was fine as usually the first page or two on a Google search of my name was all me. Very vain. Though I think there are many that shares my Norwegian name, most were not early internet adopters.<p>However in the last few years, some of the people that also share my name have started to creep up the search result, i.e. they have been covered in news articles or websites of their own. I have now started to feel guilty for hogging all the good domain names. If one of them reach out I would probably hand one of the domain names over at cost or share it somehow.<p>Though recently I have &quot;reclaimed&quot; some of the first page on Google as the search now states the infamous &quot;Some results may have been removed under data protection law in Europe&quot; at the bottom. Someone did not want to be infamous. Wasn&#x27;t me, honest.<p>I also feel slightly guilty for the few Irish people that have my username as their firstname.

"I tried to get Sonic at 100 Grand Avenue in Oakland after they put fliers on homes and businesses all around saying &quot;We are coming to Oakland with our own fiber and offering gigabit!&quot; (they have been in Oakland for a long time with their AT&amp;T DSL product). Turns out, they decided to not install to my building (254 unit high-rise), most likely due to a, what I believe to be, illegal exclusive line ownership agreement that my commercial landlords signed with AT&amp;T.<p>Thankfully, a recent entrant to the inner Bay Area market, Wave G (which has roots in Astound, a name those of you with connection to Walnut Creek might recognize, and RCN) is now providing me symmetric gigabit point to point internet for $80&#x2F;month with no caps. Just very glad to finally be rid of Comcast.<p>I will say though that I&#x27;ve previously gotten Sonic at business addresses, both DSL and Fiber, and they have been super great. Glad to see the small guy winning in such a competitive market as the Bay Area."
"&quot;when you punch someone you need to pull your arm back, before you launch it forward.

There is a price for every freedom we have. Free speech also comes with some price. Which can include riots and deaths. All we need to ask if whether slippery slope of restrictions on free speech would lead to a higher price or a lower price.<p>An FBI agent working on child rape cases told me how on one occasion he was 100% sure who the criminal was and yet he had to let him go because the person had rights. Now many such freed criminals are the price for having 4t hand 5th amendment in first place.<p>USA as a society needs to debate whether the freedoms of having free speech or freedom to own guns are worth it. Either ways it is their choice and outsiders like me would only be curious as to what choice americans would make.

So I&#x27;m guessing if you&#x27;re approaching 40 and want to become a developer you should seriously consider other options.<p>I&#x27;ve actually seen this talked about a lot. The arguments against it is usually anecdotal but the arguments for it is usually statistical. It&#x27;s a tough thing for people to accept I think.  Is there any statistics out there that actually disputes this claim? Not arguing for or against it just out of curiosity.
"I&#x27;ve been in this industry 30-some years. I thought I&#x27;d seen the worst SV has to offer, but my jaw is just on the ground. I mean, I <i>knew</i> Yelp was constantly up to no good, but...just wow.<p>I suppose I should be furious at Yelp (or GrubHub, or...someone), but I&#x27;m really more furious at Apple for having not cut that partnership a <i>long</i> time ago. It just gets my goat every time I click an icon in Apple Maps, Yelp pops up, and there&#x27;s no way to change data sources. And now this? I&#x27;m normally not one for a strongly-worded letter, but I might fire off some feedback on this one."
Worked at a company where the old school cable runners would still use wax string to lace the cables...<p>That was until the heat from the exhaust from the servers started to melt the wax and it became a really nasty sticky mess.
"It feels as though much of tech has gone from helping people accomplish their goals efficiently to a business model of extracting rents while providing no or little value.<p>In this example, what benefit is GrubHub providing to anyone? The person used Yelp solely to look up the phone number of a restaurant. GrubHub deserves 15% of his order for that? Why, because they made a deal to give X% of it to Yelp, and convinced the restaurant this was a good deal?<p>What value did they provide here?<p>Meanwgile, Yelp used to be a resource to find good businesses. Now it&#x27;s... Something else. It&#x27;s leveraging it&#x27;s market power to make money rather providing customers with any value.<p>I don&#x27;t know what the answer is but it feels like society needs to come up with a new word, new idea, (or probably an old one we&#x27;ve forgotten) and make it both an ethically bad thing and then also an illegal one (or at least one that is taxed higher)."

"Quote (from memory) from Rob Pike, a few years before he wrote the editor &quot;sam&quot;: &quot;Everybody writes a screen editor. It&#x27;s easy to do and makes them feel important. Tell them to work on something useful&quot;.<p>This was not long after he had left Caltech, where he had been a system admin&#x2F;system programmer for CITHEP (Caltech High Energy Physics), for Bell Labs. CITHEP hired a few undergraduates as the new admins and system programmers. I was one of those undergraduates.<p>Most of us used the line-oriented editor QED, but as programmers were wont to do in the early &#x27;80s, said that someday we were going to write ourselves awesome screen editors.<p>One evening, Karl Heuer and I were both boasting about how great our screen editors would be, and it somehow turned into an editor writing throw down. We took terminals at opposite sides of the room, and both started hacking away, designing as we coded.<p>This continued all night, mostly in silence, with the occasional boast (&quot;I&#x27;ve got text search working!&quot;) and counter-boast (&quot;I had that an hour ago--I&#x27;m doing regular expressions now!&quot;), and frequent trips downstairs to the vending machines for soda and snacks.<p>Another of the undergraduate system admin&#x2F;programmers, Norman Wilson, then arrived, and saw what Karl and I had been doing all night. He sent an email to Pike about it, and the quote at the start was Pike&#x27;s reply."

"I couldn&#x27;t stop thinking of the comedy potential of hypothetical conversation between a French person, who keeps saying &quot;non&quot; profusely, and a Japanese person who is appalled, and is trying their very hardest to not say &quot;no&quot;.<p>&gt; French ‘no’ is often an invitation to debate, engage and better understand one another,<p>To someone who can read and sometimes understand spoken French, that seemed like a good approximation. Also liked that part where they explain that &quot;non&quot; is just another way of saying &quot;I don&#x27;t know&quot;.<p>From the personal point of view,  would say a French &quot;non&quot; is also easier to say, it just rolls off the tongue in a way and seems less abrupt and confrontational than a &quot;no&quot; in English, for example."

&gt; When I find myself itching to interrupt someone with my thoughts about a topic I try to ask myself “what am I being asked to be an expert in here?” Often I realize that in my enthusiasm to show my casual knowledge I’m about to correct someone that who has devoted a considerable amount of time and effort into developing their expertise in the topic. I never regret keeping my mouth shut and letting them speak.<p>This definitely resonated with me.
Memory management was my favorite topic to study during my time as an undergrad. I considered going back to school to get my MS in CS solely because I loved learning about this topic so much. Fascinating to see how it works under the hood in Python. Bravo!
"Solid interview.  But one thing I saw that was missing was that Amazon also doesn&#x27;t charge itself the 15% marketplace fee (it varies slightly depending on category but most are 15%) that it charges 3rd party sellers.  Since Amazon directly sells tens of millions of items, it had at least a 15% head start on every single one of those products in terms of price competition.  Since we&#x27;re talking retail here, the margins on most items don&#x27;t exceed 15% in many cases.  The fact that they have been allowed to charge 3rd party sellers this fee while not facing it themselves or being forced to stop selling products at all if they are going to run the marketplace is mind-boggling to me.<p>At the previous company I worked for, they were very careful about this issue.  It was a fintech company that had 20+ different lines of business&#x2F;revenue.  Due to the nature of the fintech space, certain business units wanted information&#x2F;data&#x2F;services from the other divisions.  For example, the index and ETF team wanted corporate actions data from the team that monitored all corporate actions globally and delivered it via a standardized feed.  The ETF and index teams were forced to take money from their budget and actually buy the service from the other team to avoid legal issues.  They knew that if other ETF and index providers found out <i>they</i> had to pay for the product but our internal team got everything for free and could then undercut them and charge less for the ETF and index products, I guaran-fucking-tee you they would have sued us.  Every division in the company was financially separated for <i>exactly</i> this reason.  There should be some sort of class-action lawsuit on this basis from all sellers against Amazon, in my opinion.  Amazon should be forced to separate that business that actually sells its own products into a new legal entity and have to pay the fees."
"How on earth did Amazon not catch this first, that it took a police officer to notice?<p>Every month or so, run a report correlating customer reports of missing boxes or missing items in boxes, with all fulfillment and delivery people who handle it along the chain.<p>If there are any strong statistical correlations which pop up, bingo -- you&#x27;ve probably got a thief. Tail them and catch them.<p>Feels like delivery theft prevention 101, and so much benefit for so little cost."

We replaced our custom built dialup racks with something fancier and supported ISDN for the handful of customers who wanted it. The coming of DSL and cable internet was the writing on the wall to get out. The owners sold it to a larger ISP during a frothy period of mergers and acquisitions while the marketplace tidied itself up.<p>There used to be dozens of ISPs you could choose from in a big market. Sigh.
I’ve always wondered what Apple does with all the cash it has and this seems like a great place to ask.  What do companies do with it all?  Is there an article that goes into the details?  Is it invested?  In what?  Hoarded in a bank vault?  What precautions are in place for such large amounts?
"Shameless plug: My company Althea (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;althea.net"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;althea.net</a>) is making router firmware that makes it easy to people to set up incentivized mesh networks in their communities. It allows routers to pay each other for bandwidth which means that everyone hosting a node earns money for the packets they forward.<p>We have 2 networks live, one in rural Oregon and one in Medellin, Colombia. Also, 4 more networks people are currently pre-registering subscribers for in their communities, for example <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;althea.net&#x2F;hilltop"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;althea.net&#x2F;hilltop</a>."

"The artist search is very picky. E.g., &quot;cat ctevens&quot; does not work. &quot;yusuf&quot; does not work. But &quot;yusuf &#x2F; cat stevens&quot; works.<p>Some of the genre memberships seem odd. Barry McGuire is bubblegum pop? As is Zager &amp; Evans? Roy Orbison? That whole category seems to be a weird mashup of what I&#x27;d expect in bubblegum pop plus a random dump of &#x27;60s rock.<p>For artists that appear in more than one genre, it seems to use the same sample clip for all of them, so don&#x27;t be put off from checking out an artist in a genre you like because the sample doesn&#x27;t fit."

"Can I give a very practical advise to people who are reading this and trying to learn math ? As someone, who received a very strong mathematical training in a former Soviet Union, here is my practical advise:<p>1. Calculus books, just like this one, are absolutely impractical in real life situation, especially, if your goal is &quot;Industrial Mathematics&quot;. All you will learn, are basic calculus notations. You will, at best be able to solve very basic toy problems. 
2. Instead, learn basic algebra and combinatorics on extremely proficient level. This is what often is missing in US education.<p>In order to get to 2. 
3. Learn how to do a. complex algebraic manipulations, b. solve complex algebraic inequalities, c. basics of number theory, d. combinatorics. Notice, nothing going beyond Real Numbers and I&#x27;m not even including Euclidean geometry.<p>4. Best sources for that are Math Olympiad problems and technique to solve them. You will learn how to crack extremely complicated algebraic expression, how to factor them and represent them in different forms, how to do tricky substitutions. Same technique is applicable in working with complicated integrals&#x2F;diff. There is an entire layer of mathematics that devoted to inequalities and they are very applicable in solving calculus problems. Most of the technique and materials to solve those problems aren&#x27;t taught in high schools and even college course.<p>Being able to solve moderately complex algebraic problems is must before learning calculus and analysis. Crush your ego, google&#x2F;amazon for books and materials on how to solve (basic) Olympic problems that are intended for HS 9-12 graders and see what you can do."
"Lots of potential to undermine this. Start every customer service interaction with “I’m going to cancel my service”. Make yourself sound angry but don’t attack the representative directly of course (don’t be an asshole). Say you’re angry, definitely. Sense of urgency, and other social engineering techniques.<p>Companies can’t stop this that easily. If they do, they basically have to try to call bullshit and confront them. Any system that counters this will end up harming normal customers who are generally angry."
"I&#x27;d take this with... not quite a grain of salt, but maybe a small dose of healthy skepticism. Simon Baron-Cohen is a legitimate and respected researcher, but he&#x27;s well known in autism research circles as pushing very hard a theory that autism is a manifestation of an &quot;extreme male brain&quot;, which is a theory that almost every other significant researcher in the field disagrees with. I&#x27;d suggest taking a critical view of any research coming out of his lab that bolsters his pet theory, like this does - there&#x27;s a lot of context here that&#x27;s lacking."

"This is R&amp;D - not a commercial path.<p>These types of fusion projects are trying to prove the most basic piece of the puzzle: net energy generation. And it is a big problem, even for Commonwealth. I&#x27;ve heard that the magnets are underperforming by about a factor of 2 - and that&#x27;s 4 years into the project.<p>But commercialization is a lot more than just proving that the concept is physically possible. It was proven possible that man could walk on the moon, but it&#x27;s not a commercial activity 50 years in. Commercialization for nuclear energy systems means global deployment, mass manufacturing, lack of proliferation risk, extreme safety, etc. Fusion systems like Commonwealth&#x27;s do not meet any of these criteria. They are constantly generating radioactive waste because they have to breed their fuel and reprocess it on site.<p>To commercialize, you have to be able to deploy the technology in a significantly better way than traditional fission. These large fusion prototypes ($65B for ITER and $5B for Commonwealth based on their 2015 white paper, so probably 2-4x larger now) exacerbate traditional nuclear&#x27;s cost problems because they are construction projects that will last decades.

"what&#x27;s really missing in all this GDPR and privacy discussion is a technical way to enforce it. If you have a large multinational company with 50 TLD&#x27;s you might have several hundred (including all the subdomains) that are Internet facing.<p>For a company on that scale to remain compliant to things like cookie law (mention every cookie and what it does for opt-in) there is no easy way to see if you&#x27;re compliant. We need some standard (like security.txt) which defines how cookie data, impressum or other site specific links are expected which has to be machine readable. Right now every company creates it&#x27;s own mess of html which is no fun scraping to figure out if the company is compliant or not.

"A couple of minor typos and nits:<p>The for loop body should use &gt; $i<p>Inconsistent use of redirection (which requires a root shell) and sudo &lt;command&gt; | tee, which doesn&#x27;t.<p>I think the S in SMT is for <i>symmetric</i><p>And a comment - I liked the mention of mean vs minimum, though I would have liked the median to be included as well, and more info on when and why each may be more appropriate. Minimum is good when you want to answer &quot;how much time is required to do just what is required for what this code is trying to accomplish&quot;. The minimum is the closest approximation you can get; the &quot;true time required&quot; can never be more than the minimum. Mean is good for something you&#x27;ll be doing a lot of, and want to predict how much total time it&#x27;ll take. Median gives you a realistic measure of how long a task will take; if you tell someone that phase X will take 3 seconds, and 3 is the median, then you&#x27;ll be too high half the time and too low the other half, which is better than reporting the minimum which will be too low nearly 100% of the time. But then again, your article is more about eliminating noise when measuring the effects of changes, so minimum is probably generally the most reasonable thing to be looking at.  (Though if it&#x27;s a large phase with many constituent sources of variance, you have to be careful because your minimum will keep shrinking the more repetitions you do!)"

"Slightly off topic - has anyone else noticed that in the last couple years Google results have just become....crap? Like, as a programmer I&#x27;m used to googling all sorts of things, but lately it&#x27;s almost useless.

Top result was some website offering courses in programming. What the shit Google. I personally think it&#x27;s the rise of devices like Google Home that&#x27;s to blame - Google tries to reduce every search query into something that can yield a short snippet that can be read back to you - so it&#x27;s very aggressive towards highly technical queries that it used to be so good at."

"I&#x27;ve taught a few &quot;intro to regex&quot; classes and have settled on a very simple explanation that seems to work even with fairly non-technical audiences. In short:<p>1) Regular expressions and &quot;regex&quot; are different things. Regex is a superset of regular expressions. But if you can understand regular expressions you can understand a huge number of regexes and have the tools to understand the rest of the syntax that the system uses.<p>2) There are many many many regular expression and regex dialects and engines. It&#x27;s useful to learn the dialect you are trying to use.<p>3) Originally, regular expressions were used to describe a generator of strings. It can be helpful to approach writing regexes from this standpoint. It&#x27;s not about what it matches, but what strings the regex can produce. I&#x27;ve had many students go from bewildered incomprehension to immediate eureka when I describe this.<p>4) There are only three rules that the beginning regex user has to know:<p>i) Concatenation - you can make a bigger generator by combining one generator after the other. For example: the regex &#x27;a&#x27; and the regex &#x27;b&#x27; can be concatenated into &#x27;ab&#x27; and produces only the string &#x27;ab&#x27;.<p>ii) Alternation - you can specify one character or another using the pipe character in most dialects &#x27;|&#x27;. For example the regex &#x27;a|b&#x27; produces either the string &#x27;a&#x27; or &#x27;b&#x27;.<p>iii) Repetition - the character &#x27; <i></i>* &#x27; is a postfix operator that means that the character that preceeds it can be repeated zero to an infinite number of times. For example: &#x27;a<i></i>* &#x27; produces the empty string, &#x27;a&#x27;, &#x27;aa&#x27;, &#x27;aaa&#x27; and so on.<p>5) By combining these (i.e. using concatenation) and the grouping operators &#x27;(&#x27; &#x27;)&#x27; you can write a regex for almost anything.<p>6) Nearly all of the other character you see in regexes that don&#x27;t make sense are simply syntactic sugar that make it easier and shorter to write common expressions in a more compact form. Examples:<p>Writing lots of alternations of single characters (called character classes)
- &#x27;a|b|c|d|e|f&#x27; can be written as [a-f]
- an expression that is the alternation of every character except the newline character can be written as &#x27;.&#x27;
There&#x27;s a whole host of these kinds of things.<p>Writing lots of different kinds of repetitions introduces lots of new operators
- &#x27;aa<i></i>* &#x27; can be written as &#x27;a+&#x27; where &#x27;+&#x27; means &#x27;repeat the previous character <i>1</i> or more times
- &#x27;a?&#x27; means &#x27;repeat the previous character 0 or one times&#x27;
- &#x27;a{1,5}&#x27; means &#x27;repeat the previous character 1 to 5 times&#x27;
There&#x27;s also an entire table of these things.<p>After that it&#x27;s mostly practice and referring to the description of the operators for the dialect you are using.<p>I usually cover capture groupings (e.g. \1, \2, \3 or $1, $2, $3) later on if necessary as it requires people to have a good handle on the particulars of their languages way of handling those things. At this time I&#x27;ll also over the &#x27;(?:.)&#x27; non-capture group operator if their dialect allows.<p>About as frequently I&#x27;ll have to introduce &#x27;^&#x27; and &#x27;$&#x27; and begin and end string operators and also deconflict it from &#x27;[^.]&#x27;.<p>All the crazy-ass back&#x2F;forward reference stuff I usually leave out as people almost never need or come across those except in pretty rare instances. In those cases they usually have enough regex under their belt that it&#x27;s just another topic to pick up.<p>This doesn&#x27;t get anybody to pro-wizard level and there&#x27;s always edge cases and weird Perl-golf stuff that&#x27;s out there, but it&#x27;ll get most people to generally functional inside of a day or two and I&#x27;ll just make myself available to spot answer questions or remind them where they forgot something."
"Is no-one else running into FastLeaderElectionFailed? When you have a system that writes a lot of offset&#x2F;transaction info to zookeeper you can push the zxid 32-bit counter to rollover in a matter of days. When this happens  it can bring zookeeper to a grinding halt for 15 minutes after 2 nodes try to nominate themselves for leadership and the rest of the cluster sits back and waits for a timeout.<p><a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;issues.apache.org&#x2F;jira&#x2F;browse&#x2F;ZOOKEEPER-2164"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;issues.apache.org&#x2F;jira&#x2F;browse&#x2F;ZOOKEEPER-2164</a><p><a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;issues.apache.org&#x2F;jira&#x2F;browse&#x2F;ZOOKEEPER-2791"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;issues.apache.org&#x2F;jira&#x2F;browse&#x2F;ZOOKEEPER-2791</a><p>Requests (can&#x27;t find them in JIRA at the moment, so I need to paraphrase) in the past to have a call to initiate a controlled leadership move to another node have been turned down as &quot;you don&#x27;t need this&quot; yet leadership election fails in some circumstances! In addition there&#x27;s no command or configuration to disable FastLeaderElection.<p>So the zookeeper maintainers keep operators limited to having to flip nodes off and on again, which is really a bad way to manage software because it impacts clients as well as leadership (and even if clients recover, most code that I&#x27;ve seen like to make some noise when zk connections flap). I would really like to eliminate all use cases for zookeeper where there is a chance that the zxid will exceed the size of its 32-bit counter component in the span of, say, a decade so that as an operator I don&#x27;t have to set alerts on the zxid counter creeping up, and having to reset zookeeper and restart all of its clients (many versions of many zookeeper clients don&#x27;t retry after connection loss, don&#x27;t retry after a timeout, don&#x27;t cope with the primary connection failing, will have totally given up after 15 minutes, etc.).<p>I think that the kafka maintainers have been doing a better job of actively maintaining their code and ensuring it works in adverse conditions, so I&#x27;m on board with this proposal.<p>Zookeeper isn&#x27;t magic, it&#x27;s just pretty good at most of what it does, and I think that projects that understand when they&#x27;ve pushed zookeeper into a bad corner may benefit from this kind of move, if they also have a good idea of how they can do better."

"I&#x27;m not an economist, but my impression is that if the Chinese currency is allowed to float, the major effect is that they would begin to import more goods from abroad and that their exports would be less competitive. But what would China import that they are not already importing?<p>Personally I would rather see the rules about local ownership of businesses open up so that foreign people can actually freely do business in China. Now that China is not a super poor country anymore, it seems fair. And this way they can keep their currency devalued as there is still a way for trading partners to use it to their advantage, while the majority of the advantage remains with China"

"&gt; <i>It is a regular occurrence to hear about open source developers selling their browser extensions, only for their users to be exploited later on by the new owners. ... We are witnessing the failure of browser vendors to recognize the value of our labor and the important role it plays in a healthy browser ecosystem.</i><p>So this is an interesting philosophical question - the market value of the extension is the value of &quot;monetizing&quot; it by stuffing ads, or worse, monitoring&#x2F;tracking&#x2F;exfiltration, into the extension. It&#x27;s the market value of the trust of the extension&#x27;s userbase. Is that the value of the extension developer&#x27;s labor?<p>I would argue not really. The value of a bank, for instance, is <i>not</i> the amount of money in all of the vaults. That money is held in trust for customers, and it is not for the owner of the bank to dispose of. Therefore, nobody who makes a <i>fair</i> offer for the bank should expect those resources in the transaction, so a fair market price for the bank is much less - such as the present value of the interest earned by the bank minus the interest returned to customers.<p>In particular, the only reason the bank has customers is they expect to get their money back, generally with interest, at some point in the future. If they didn&#x27;t, they&#x27;d put their money elsewhere. So if a bank is willing to sell the contents of the customer accounts, that indicates incomplete information in the market - customers didn&#x27;t know the bank wasn&#x27;t trustworthy. The true market value of the bank, in a perfect-information market, would be close to zero.<p>It seems like the problem here is that we know two ways of compensating browser extension developers: &quot;don&#x27;t&quot; and &quot;breach your users&#x27; trust.&quot; Those point to wildly undervalued <i>and wildly overvalued</i> estimates of the fair market value of the developers&#x27; work. And we should come up with some fairer way to value their work (or, more fundamentally, to compensate them; we may not need to monetize the extension, necessarily) first, and I&#x27;m not totally sure it&#x27;s the fault of browsers for not having had such a clever idea - it seems like we collectively need to figure that out."

"I do not support 8-chan, but by doing this and what they did with the daily stormer they are no longer a neutral platform. A neutral platform is like a utility, barring illegal activity, users have a right to use the service as long as they pay for it. Once it is curated, it is not. This is why efforts are afoot to have companies that do this to not get section 230 protections for content hosted on the platform.<p>The last thing I want is a large, un-elected, tech company moralizing about content hosted on it. Frankly, they are not good at it. If what 8-chan is doing is illegal this can be addressed through the legal system.

"As a Roblox programmer (Builder’s Club) scripting a game, the draw of addressing this huge user base by way of simply coding Lua scripts to release a product that invites In App Purchase is downright tempting!<p>Then you discover the apparently wide spread client side hacking (speed, teleport, aim bots... you name it) and content theft (models, geometry, Localscripts) and pervasive scam attempts so frequently reported.

If our US location tickles your fancy, you get to help setting up a brand new office too.<p>Smarkets develops a reliable, low-latency, highly concurrent betting exchange based on trading exchange designs. We&#x27;re also building a fast, modern web interface to allow for a smoother experience. Servicing our users is top priority.<p>The Smarkets platform is written predominantly in Python, C++ (replacing still present Erlang[ß]) and Javascript for React, relying heavily on asynchronous programming techniques. The tech stack sports Kafka, Postgres and increasingly Kubernetes. We use REST where we can. Life at Smarkets circles around people, version control, configuration management and automation. We can - and do - deploy to production several times a day.<p>Our entire production is in AWS. In fact, Smarkets was the first gambling operator under the Maltese regulator to get permission to run everything in the cloud. We push the envelope where needed and educate auditors when necessary.<p>We are looking for engineering talent all across the board: frontend, infrastructure, trading engine, security - and of course generalists, those yet to find their calling.<p>If you like the idea of flat structure and practical engineering approach, see our jobs at <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;smarkets.com&#x2F;careers"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;smarkets.com&#x2F;careers</a> .<p>---<p>ß: to pre-empt questions on why C++ or why not Erlang - our exchange team have promised to put together a proper write-up on the tradeoffs, design constraints, performance needs, etc. In fullness of time, that is, when the most painful (and probably interesting) migrations are behind them."
"First, I disagree with the author&#x27;s post that all software developed at Google is revolutionary low-level technical infrastructure. But that&#x27;s not the only type of software development that benefits from avoiding the productivity tax that agile imposes.<p>There are teams at Google that look to use agile methods. E.g. I see standups, there are internal tools that track sprints, etc. I think these are mostly front end teams.<p>I&#x27;ve never worked on front end but was on a team that used scrum at a previous job. I hated it. It seems like a huge impedance mismatch for my kind of work.<p>I&#x27;m guessing some consultants sold management on the miraculous benefits of scrum at my previous job, they like the snakeoil they were sold and forced scrum on everyone. The amount of overhead process it brings is an enormous tax on productivity.<p>Some people call this &quot;corporate scrum&quot; to try to distinguish it from real scrum. But this feels like a No True Scotsman fallacy. Why is it so damn hard to do &quot;real scrum&quot; and actually get the productivity benefits it promises? I&#x27;ve never met any SWE in real life who has tried scrum and liked it.<p>At Google, the development process is not just &quot;develop 10000 lines of code on their own&quot; like some posts here have imagined. There is typically a design phase that gets wide buy in, and then code reviews, and extensive testing every step of the way during development. This feels far more realistic as a process.<p>And it is NOT some &quot;waterfall&quot; process which only seems to exist as a strawman for agile consultants to knock down. There is no architect who designs the code and then hands it off to code monkeys to go implement exactly as written. That&#x27;s ridiculous and now how software is written anywhere as far as I can tell.<p>If I were to answer the question in the title myself, it&#x27;s that Google has allowed engineers to build a process that works for them, and they almost never pick scrum or other agile methods."

"Wow never thought I&#x27;d see this on HN! I paid $20k to go to tech school for aviation maintenance. After doing that for 3 years I figured it just wasn&#x27;t for me and I decided to go to university for computer science.<p>But before my last day of being an aircraft mechanic, I &quot;accidentally&quot; brought home a roll of high temp (non-waxed) lacing tape because I was already in the habit of using string to tie cables together (common in aviation). Figured if I paid $20k to go to school that I better at least find some other use for it. So far it is just cable lacing. I&#x27;m the only one I know that does it instead of zip ties.

"I majored in English lit at university and one of my early requirements was a single author course. Having little general knowledge of famous authors, I chose the Toni Morrison class at random. I remember on the first day being surprised to find our that Toni Morrison was a woman and that her writing had such a strong focus on race and slavery. I was rather intimidated.<p>Turned out to be one of the best classes I had during those years. It was a very small group (I feel like only ten people or something) and there was a lot of really excellent discussion about the books. Jazz stood out to me as one of her best works, the focus shift in narrators throughout the novel was, I think, my first real exposure to the &quot;unreliable narrator&quot; concept and it made the story so powerful."

"I think the answer badly misconstrues the purpose of &quot;short term planning&quot; and &quot;continuous integration&quot; as though these concepts preclude long proof-of-concept projects. The point of short delivery cycles is <i>not</i> to deliver a viable product to an external customer every two weeks. Rather it simply ensures that code remains in-sync with its intended use-case and guards against individuals going off on untracked tangents.<p>Basically, developers who try to develop 10,000 lines of code on their own, without sharing it for a month, create massive risks and are an impediment to their team.

"What kind of free speech are we exactly advocating here? The freedom to spread cheap hate, fake news and bigotry against minorities? I&#x27;m sorry but moderating such offenses isn&#x27;t a limitation to free speech. For the same reason why, if you start shouting nig<i></i> or monkey to black people in a shopping mall, the police is likely to intervene and take you away - and I don&#x27;t think that any sane person would argue that they&#x27;re violating your freedom of speech. Popper taught us that we can&#x27;t be tolerant towards intolerants, if we really want to protect our tolerant rule of law.<p>You can still have freedom of speech while implementing moderation to make sure that hate speech, bigotry and fake news don&#x27;t spread - because if those things spread then they leak into the real world as death. 8chan has been shut down not only because it hosted hate communities, but because it refused to apply any moderation there.<p>However, the problem is not 8chan alone. It&#x27;s good to shut down websites where hate speech proliferates without constraints, but a couple of days or weeks later new *chan websites are likely to pop up to replace them, or maybe they&#x27;d make a Telegram group. The root problem is Americans. And I&#x27;m honestly not sure of how to fix the problem with a whole population that has become so irrational, polarized, ignorant and sensitive to hate speech."

"Free speech is a fascinating debate to me.<p>When I was younger, I was a free speech absolutist.  I believed in rationality and that if you couldn&#x27;t defend&#x2F;oppose ideas then your position had no strength.  Censorship was a sign of weakness.  Even clearly &quot;good&quot; censorship (say, banning child porn) has problematic boundaries.<p>Now...I&#x27;m far less confident.  I still believe in rationality, but I also see clear weaknesses in human&#x27;s ability to process.  Rationality emerges over time, not in the moment.  Speech isn&#x27;t just ideas, it&#x27;s emotion.  It creates social pressure, fears, threats.  And humans are social creatures.  Even this forum is chock-ful of signaling patterns and inclusion.  These aren&#x27;t personal failures, but human facts - to be without these would be to dissolve the functions that make us form communities - to remove the items that make us NOT be &quot;defectors&quot; (to signal).<p>We have to trust others, or we&#x27;ll spend all our time verifying all the information we get and never accomplish anything.  But this introduces the ability for others to exploit this.  Speech has never been inherently good nor bad, and thus &quot;free speech&quot; is also neither inherently good nor bad.  It is just a force multiplier for whatever you try to do.  And &quot;good&quot; speech can&#x27;t be solely dedicated to battling &quot;bad&quot; speech if it wants to achieve any change, while bad speech achieves its goals just by existing, or even by demanding the attention of those giving &quot;good&quot; speech.  An inherent imbalance.<p>In the big picture, this all shakes out over time.  The good speech investigates and explores ideas.  Bad speech is beaten.  Speech in the middle helps ensure that the &quot;good&quot; speech really is good, and periodic bouts of bad speech help the system enforce the boundaries that move everything in a healthy-for-society direction.  But to zoom out to that level is to ignore all the suffering such a system entails.  &quot;You can&#x27;t have a society that is afraid of hurting feelings!&quot; free speech advocates will cry out...correctly.  Some amount of suffering is unavoidable.  Pick any arbitrary line between restricted speech and unrestricted speech and it&#x27;s easy to see that people will suffer as a result.   But that does not mean that we should automatically accept that unrestricted speech is the answer.  That we should be blind to all the suffering that IS happening because we fear the suffering that MIGHT happen.<p>Or perhaps unrestricted speech IS the answer...but a lot more of us need to be calling out for the societal responsibilities.  Free speech is a powerful tool, and like any tool should be used wisely.  If we aren&#x27;t calling people out for using it poorly, but are calling out people for any attempt to restrict it, we&#x27;re empowering only one side of the equation.  But that gets into a circular argument, because if you replace government restrictions with social ones, you have the same result - restricted speech.<p>I don&#x27;t know where I stand on this.  The only thing I see clearly is that the number of people that seem to be seriously examining the issue is vanishingly small relative to the population."
"Sonic customer here, but will try to be neutral. The value proposition was probably the best selling point, and they rarely raise prices. There is a certain satisfaction when the odd piece of Comcast advertisement comes by mail offering 2-3x the price for 1&#x2F;8 the bandwidth from Sonic. Fiber customers can return the residential gateway and use their own router, which saves you $10&#x2F;month. You have to agree you understand the implications of loosing remote troubleshooting, but I&#x27;m sure HN users are savvy in this department.<p>Prior to getting symmetrical fiber, I didn&#x27;t have a clue what all that bandwidth could be used for, but again the value proposition was icing on the cake. Years later I still haven&#x27;t a clue what all of this bandwidth was for. Imagine a kid on a fieldtrip to a famous chocolate factory imagining swimming in a chocolate fountain. The fountain is real, but you dip maybe one strawberry when you get there.<p>The only customer support call was easily enough to self fix.

"This post feels a little disingenuous...<p>First of all, it&#x27;s not like most engineers at Google are working on Bigtable or Borg, with a &quot;very simple interface and tons of hidden internal complexity&quot;. <i>Plenty</i> of them are working on normal consumer-facing products, the &quot;software with a simple core and lots of customer visible features that are incrementally useful&quot;, although maybe that&#x27;s not the hype people want to believe.<p>But either way -- he insists &quot;companies like Google write revolutionary software which has never been written before, and which doesn’t work until complex subcomponents are written.&quot; But putting aside the &quot;revolutionary&quot; hype, there&#x27;s no reason subcomponents can&#x27;t have agile philosophies applied.<p>A big part of agile is ensuring developers actually understand the requirements (consensus via point estimation), seek to <i>define</i> requirements where they&#x27;re suddenly discovered to be vague&#x2F;undefined, and have frequent check-ins to demonstrate that their software is making progress towards those requirements and raising any potential blockers early on, and not accidentally going down a rabbit hole of building the wrong thing (despite best intentions) for weeks at a time which nobody notices until too late, and the project is delayed by months.<p>That&#x27;s just as important for a subcomponent of a subcomponent, as it is for a service dashboard. To assume agile is only for &quot;consumer-facing&quot; software is a deep and fundamental misunderstanding."

"And the tragedy of early adoption! Microsoft looks antiquated for using UTF-16 today, but it was actually pretty cutting edge when it happened. They adopted a lot of tech pretty early too, like XML.

I accomplished similar prior using API hooking but a Microsoft solution can simply do a much better job across the board.

Your brain has to backtrack and figure out where it was in the first place.&quot;[2]<p>[1] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ekmillerlab.mit.edu&#x2F;tag&#x2F;multitasking&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ekmillerlab.mit.edu&#x2F;tag&#x2F;multitasking&#x2F;</a><p>[2] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.today.com&#x2F;health&#x2F;multitasking-doesn-t-work-why-focus-isn-t-just-hocus-t69276"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.today.com&#x2F;health&#x2F;multitasking-doesn-t-work-why-f...</a>"

"I&#x27;m an author on CPAN who pushes one or two releases a month[1]. I&#x27;m actually surprised the number of uploads is still as high as it is, and a few thoughts struck me about the graph:<p>1) Most long time libraries have pretty much reached stability and the (still relatively high) backwards compatibility promise of perl5 means they don&#x27;t have to be updated to support changes in the language, which still has releases every year.<p>2) The quality of uploads to CPAN is of the form of solving more complex problems or interfacing with core Unix&#x2F;network&#x2F;internet&#x2F;lower level lib stuff stuff - you don&#x27;t see so much of the leftpad type modules on CPAN.<p>3) It definitely feels like the number of authors has shrunk significantly, even though the graph suggests that has stayed relatively level. I suspect there&#x27;s a long tail of active authors and most signups never actually upload anything<p>4) The biggest problem now is finding modules for newer APIs - I wrote some, including for more well known services such as GoCardless and Monzo<p>5) Holy crap, the graph covers almost 24 years of uploads. You will probably see the same pattern in Python, JS, Go, and so on if you come back in an equivalent number of years - the most common problems get solved first, and libraries uploaded for those.<p>6) The graph covers uploads to CPAN, I&#x27;d guess a far more important one would be downloads from CPAN as that will probably give you more information about the relative level of use of the language.<p>[1] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;metacpan.org&#x2F;author&#x2F;LEEJO"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;metacpan.org&#x2F;author&#x2F;LEEJO</a>"

"Common Lisp addresses some of these problems out of the box. It returns a second value from some functions to distinguish between &quot;nothing was found&quot; vs. &quot;A value was found, and it is nil.&quot;<p>CL also uses a special reserved value to mean &quot;unbound&quot; so it&#x27;s always clear when a symbol or instance is uninitialized vs. initialized with nil. It&#x27;s not possible for the programmer to portably see this value or assign it but there are functions to find out if a container is unbound and set it to such.<p>Having said that, problems remain. I prefer to use maybe and error monads in my CL programs now rather than just returning nil. That solves most of the remaining issues."

Few understand the iron grasp Google has on the ecosystem. Soon they are changing the model to allow for fair competition, but thus far Google AdX has had a massive advantage by having the first and last price in every bid request. They get to see what other ad networks are paying for each request. They get to optimize their profits using data from users, publishers, ad exchanges, and advertisers, mostly because of the absolute monopoly Google DFP&#x2F;Ad Manager has in the ad server market.

"Ok I&#x27;ll bite. I had the realization yesterday that I peaked at 25 (I&#x27;m 42). I got my computer engineering degree in 1999 and used to do things like really complicated integrations in calculus, and solve weird 3D intersection formulas for different variables to do change of coordinates on various surfaces for rasterizing before wolframalpha.com was a thing. I look at my invention lists from 20 years ago and they were pretty far out man. Like, they expected a future where maybe we had real multiprocessing with FPGAs or something instead of proprietary video cards.<p>But now, I can barely install a new software stack without this primal sense of exhaustion. I can&#x27;t explain it, but it feels like everything is just.. wrong somehow. Or a little off. Like maybe the profit motive and disruption became the primary motivators instead of progress and scientific discovery.<p>It&#x27;s to the point where I could probably write my own programming language more easily than learn the various idiosyncrasies&#x2F;dealbreakers&#x2F;errata of whatever industry standard language I&#x27;m supposed to use. I find major problems with most any framework in the first 5 minutes, and then spend most of my time after that figuring out how to use tricks with inheritance or pointing the package manager to a forked version of the repo with fixes so that I can extend the framework to do very first principles kind of things.<p>I think what it comes down to, is that I see programming as this giant spreadsheet where data reacts to other data changing, constraints get satisfied or exceptional situations happen. But unfortunately, the most overly hyped languages (like Ruby for example, or Java, not to pick on them) seem to go out of their way to block the developer from staying in a functional paradigm. Almost every codebase I&#x27;ve seen has descended into spaghetti code hell.<p>And unfortunately, that nebulous ball of cruft is where the money is in software development. I&#x27;ve spent the last 20 years knee deep in code so ugly (from assembly code up through SQL) that I feel like a plumber who sees code as.. sewage. There is just so much code, filling every crack where declarative and data-driven solutions would accomplish the exact same thing but with no side effects.<p>But new devs don&#x27;t seem to care to learn where I&#x27;m coming from or why my code might be better in fundamental ways even though it looks a little strange to them. Sometimes in a conversation I&#x27;ll see myself and think &quot;wow, I really do resemble a crazy person&quot;. I just feel too old to begin the training, but too young to be this burned out. I fantasize often about giving up all worldly possessions and moving to an artist compound in the woods.<p>I worry I&#x27;ve just reached the point where I&#x27;m a fish trying to ride a bicycle but I don&#x27;t know of an ecosystem that would value my natural and hard-earned talents for making the world a better place. There&#x27;s just an endless stream of soul-sucking contracts, each more punishing than the one before. All of the money is tied up in the establishment now. No room for creative daydreaming along implausible trains of thought in the universe of possibilities. Just the grind. Always the grind.<p>If I&#x27;m depressed then it&#x27;s environmental, and I feel stuck with it because I can&#x27;t change the world. But that&#x27;s why I learned to code in the first place 30 years ago. So now what? I guess I&#x27;m just curious if any older devs here have reached similar conclusions. And like, were you able to rise above it? Were you lucky enough to start 5 years earlier than me and capitalize on the booms to the point where you&#x27;re independently wealthy now? Or is that a widespread fallacy, that &quot;if I was just a little older&quot; maybe I could have ridden a bubble? Or do you fantasize about being 20 years younger, starting in the world today where you have access to all the secrets of entrepreneurship online and still have a beginner&#x27;s optimism?<p>I think the gist of my melancholy is that I have a knack for solving very difficult problems handily (nobody seems to need that skill anymore) but my short game stinks and I struggle to summon the motivation to do the mundane things (that are in demand). I&#x27;m tired of learning new languages and frameworks because they are each terrible in their own way but collectively the software engineering industry can&#x27;t see the flaws so they inevitably remain.<p>Sorry this was a bit of an overshare but hey it&#x27;s Friday."

What are the upsides?<p>* Less bandwidth and energy and mobile phone battery is wasted.<p>* The site will still load in the same time that people are normally used to anyway.<p>* Rich people and poor people get the same experience; you don&#x27;t pay a poor people tax if you are poor.

"Let me provide a counter-anecdote.<p>I purchased a utility sink&#x2F;cabinet combo from Home Depot last year for $200. The same product is sold by Lowes and all over the Internet in various styles. The OEM is this company called Conglom, but Home Depot markets all its plumbing products as &quot;Glacier Bay&quot; and has its own support system for those products.<p>So anyway, I install the sink and the faucet has a small leak. So I call the Glacier Bay number expecting terrible service. The call is answered immediately. A lady takes my information and says she&#x27;ll contact the OEM and get a new part sent to me and puts me on hold. She picks back up a minute or two later to say the OEM is closed for the day but she&#x27;ll contact them the next day. I think that&#x27;s the end of it, but then I get a call from her the next day to confirm she&#x27;s reached the OEM and the replacement part is on the way.<p>HD can&#x27;t make but a few dollars if anything on this product.<p>Aside, Moen also provides insanely good customer service.

"Performance is part of accessibility. I haven&#x27;t realized this earlier, but now it&#x27;s clear to me. I think accessibility is much more than what we believe it to be. It&#x27;s about allowing as many people as possible to access our services. This, in my opinion, is a moral issue, and I think not doing that is just plain unethical. Making a website that&#x27;s not WCAG compliant, i.e. doesn&#x27;t work well for disabled people, one that is not available in specific countries or for specific age groups is bad, but making website that wastes resources is bad too. If you&#x27;re doing one kind of accessibility because moral issues, you should be doing the other kinds too."

"IMHO this reflects poorly on CloudFlare.<p>The supreme court has ruled time and time again that the right to free speech implies the right to be heard.<p>While CloudFlare obviously isn&#x27;t legally required to serve 8chan, the only service they are really providing is making it so that 8chan can&#x27;t be DDOS&#x27;d.

So really by no longer serving 8chan, the only thing they are doing is allowing and&#x2F;or encouraging others to violate 8chan&#x27;s constitutional rights.<p>It reminds me a lot of Charlottesville, where people showed up to try to shout over the white nationalists and it just ended up with a bunch of people getting run over by a car.

"Unfortunately this post does not give me much confidence that YC will replicate its success in biotech. To illustrate why I’m just going to focus on the first example they give, Shasqi, because coincidentally this is the type of idea I and my colleagues would regularly propose to each other and play “find the flaw.”<p>In this case, this falls into the bin of, “are you absolutely sure this is the reason why cancer therapies fail?” Localized drug delivery sounds great in paper, but to my knowledge and what I’ve learned talking to people who know more than me, its not the most important issue - its actually hard to even be absolutely sure that the effects of chemical chemotherapy are fully explained by tumor-local effects (there’s a huge immune system component to it), so its efficacy compared to real chemotherapy is hard to predict.<p>Their publication also reads like one of tens of thousands of similar papers and approaches that often get published in the hundreds or thousands of journals. The paper is not bad at all, its a good proof of concept of the _chemistry_ and the fact that it does at least something inside a living organism (as opposed to chemical methods and derivatives that are not even biocompatible), but it does not convince me a bit that this is actually a worthwhile method to think about.<p>While there are numerous issues that lead to it, the most important is the fact that this (and virtually every other) paper that tries to show efficacy in cancer therapy uses xenograft mouse models to show it; this is where you take mice which have most of their immune system knocked out and inject HUMAN cancer cells (that have been cultured in petridishes for decades) to make a tumor and then try out various drugs to see which cures the tumor. Why do we need to use immune-compromised mice? Because otherwise the mouse’s own immune system will recognize any cell that did’t originate from its own body as foreign and quickly kill it. So now, we have a system where this drug-modification is compared to its baseline (which as I mentioned above, is probably going to need a viable immune system  to function as it does in a real patient) in a system that inherently stifles it. So even if it shows to be better in a wildly artificial model, it says nothing about its efficacy in a human. I’ll go out on a limb and say that there’s actually enough evidence in their papers that this will never be better than regular chemo in a human (will be glad to go into detail if anyone’s interested) but even otherwise there’s not enough info available to say that this will work in humans.<p>While that might have been more detailed than some might like, the point is that I’d personally not even consider myself an “expert” in cancer therapy; I merely did a PhD in a lab that used to do some stuff related to it. But I can already see so many red flags in this single effort (I’ve seen similar reflags, wherever I knew some stuff, in other YC funded companies too). So, at least for therapeutic areas, I’m still not convinced that optimistic outlooks towards such projects is a good thing.<p>Of course, just saying you shouldn’t be optimistic with biotech projects is not enough, and I’ve struggled till now to put it in reasonable words why biotech (especially therapeutic) is different from technology companies and projects. But this article solidified it in my head and I boil it down to two points:<p>1. In tech, when you show a proof of concept for a product, you have essentially created the final product in the final environment as its going to be used by at least some users. Almost always, the main things you need to figure out are how you can “scale” it, and how you can make it appeal to a wider audience; but the premise of the product is proven with the prototype. With biology however, the premise is most definitely not proven with anything short of a phase II clinical trial. Almost all animal models (or anything in a lab dish) are significantly different from humans in ways that are fundamentally important for the mechanisms of action for these drugs.  The only way to be absolutely sure that a drug has a really good chance of working in a human being is to inject it into a human with that disease and see if they die. So no matter how fancy the xenograft model or what caliber the nature publication might be, its still at best comparable to a deck of powerpoint slides in the tech VC pitch analogy and not anything comparable to a real prototype.<p>2. In tech, its a reasonable assumption that you can build more or less anything as functionality in an app&#x2F;website, as long as it makes reasonable physical sense, because many engineers can have a fully comprehensive mental model of what is and is not physically and computationally possible inside computers. In biology its not at all a good assumption that if it makes sense in your head, then it will work in a human being, because no single person (not even a mythical House MD) has a full mental model of what we currently understand about all our biological systems.  Our systems are too complicated and intricate (and without an organized creator) to keep in head by anyone, so its really hard to predict what will fail and cause a problem with our hypothesis. To some extent, every biotech project we do, even as an expert, is akin to someone who has barely used a smartphone coming up with an app idea - of course once in a while its going to make sense and be brilliant, but most of the time they have no idea how technology works in the backend and hence cannot say what is and is not possible.<p>Given these fundamental differences between biotech and tech, I’m going to remain skeptical until someone tells how they have figured out a solution to them."

"When I started grad school, one of the things my thesis adviser suggested I do was to spend a few hours looking at the Palomar Sky Survey plates (this was in 1980).   I spent many pleasant hours doing that, and what was striking was how few perfectly symmetric spiral galaxies there are, in relative terms.  You see beautiful symmetric galaxies pictured in your Astronomy text books, but in truth most spirals are warped, or show distortion from a nearby companion, or obviously are merging with another galaxy, etc.   Most spiral galaxies are deformed."

And when you need one, you can rent one, borrow one or use a taxi&#x2F;uber&#x2F;lyft.<p>And as we are talking about dense cities, the usual argument of &quot;but wait, US is not as dense, we need cars!&quot; is moot. US cities need cars because of being designed for cars. That&#x27;s it, and that could be changed but that would require massive investments."
"I wish this elaborated more on how Amazon is a monopoly. The interviewee defines it as having the power to set prices and exclude competition. I don’t see either of those happening. There’s a ton of competition, more than enough to severely limit their ability to set prices."

"Another instance of the scientific community converging to a consensus congruent with the Genesis account of creation. Genesis 2:5-6 &quot;the Lord God had not sent rain on the earth ... but streams came up from the earth and watered the whole surface of the ground.&quot;<p>Two other notable instances: the universe had a beginning (a Big Bang) and evolution occurred generally in the order described in Genesis 1 (nothing, plants, water creatures, avians, land animals, humans).<p>An old story not transgressing truth (truths that are being progressively discovered in more detail) should not be easily ignored. Though it is indeed a story for a spiritual purpose, not one meant to match the contemporaneous description of observations. If it were, it would be outdated (or too ahead of the times to be understandable or acceptable at all)."

"The flipside of the coin needs to be mentioned too.  What Europe is doing around zoning and infrastructure is, as is often the case, the &quot;Big Government&quot; model, compared to the U.S.&#x27;s more &quot;Small Government&quot; approach.<p>I get the impression that, outside of a few major metropolitan areas with real estate booms, most areas within the U.S. have been comparatively more successful than most areas within Europe at enabling decently-sized real estate at affordable prices and at enabling the younger generation to get on the real estate ladder without their parents&#x27; help.<p>Cities where infrastructure is super-dense and everything is walkable, like NYC and many European city centers are nice for young people, students, urban&#x2F;digital nomads, tourists, etc.<p>When you get to a certain age and want to settle down and start a family, priorities start to change and you realize how trapped you are, with the European model.<p>You&#x27;re paying a fortune to rent a shoebox.  Add to that the high taxes and mandatory social security that exists in Europe.  This means, you find yourself in a situation where you&#x27;re wealthy but cash poor, and have little opportunity to accumulate wealth in the form of cash.  (The kind of cash that would be needed as a down-payment on larger real estate).<p>The option that people exercise in the U.S. is &quot;move to the burbs&quot;.  ...but this option is not so readily available in Europe.  Here, high standards of infrastructure are enforced before planning permission for residential development in suburbs&#x2F;exurbs can even be granted.  This means that this kind of real estate is pricey pretty much the day it becomes viable to build there.  Further out, in properly rural areas, zoning laws will often permit building there only when buildings have an actual agricultural purpose.<p>The car plays a pretty important part in that: Rezone a bunch of agricultural land into residential.  Build some roads that go there and connect it to the powergrid and telecommunication network.  Boom.  Affordable real estate.  People can move there, and after you have enough people, you can start to think about public transportation, schools, things to do, and all that other stuff.  But you do that AFTER it has become economically viable to offer that stuff, not as a prerequisite for allowing people to build there.  This is, in my mind, something that the U.S. has a lot of and that we could really use more of in Europe."
"I see there&#x27;s one more problem with thinker sculpture study, that has nothing to do how we analyze the data.
There was another study a while ago, where a dime was placed (or not placed for control group) in the public copying machine. And then researchers would ask those people who were using that copying machine a few questions, one of them was &quot;on a scale from 0 to 10 how happy you are?&quot;
People who found their dimes reported significantly higher happiness scores, but I don&#x27;t remember by how much.
Assuming this experiment was true, and not some journalists twisting the data wihtout understanding statistics, I see there&#x27;s some analogy with the sculpture study.
In particular, the conclusion I would make is that asking people questions about happiness or religion or anything whatsoever doesn&#x27;t tell you much about their actual believes, since their answers are heavily affected by their mood at the moment.
I asume this statement can be turned into another study verifying its correctness, and then after we collect the results, we&#x27;d have to start arguing about Bayes vs. Fischer all over again..."

"One way to think about text, is as the only data we use that shrinks over the years.  Every other type of data continues to grow.<p>The way this can be stretched to make sense is by thinking for example how much these have grown over 20 years.<p>Media (music, video, images) grows staggeringly because of 200p &gt; 4k, 128bit mp3 to flac or whatever and there&#x27;s more of it all that&#x27;s gone digital.<p>Code size continues to grow quite significantly even.<p>But text? Even the massive wikipedia&#x27;s size, only a fraction is text content.<p>Then as memory capacity also grows it&#x27;s really a back and forth battle between computing resources and all other data, except text.<p>Hard to think of many places 4 byte chars would matter nowadays, maybe the tiniest devices for a few apps?"

"I use a swap file these days because in the 4 years since I purchased my computers I went from never hitting 32gigs of memory used at the same time, to hitting it once a week. The worst offenders are browsers and the JVM. The swap file saves me from those 20 seconds of distraction when running a variable memory workload that suddenly jumps over the limit and hardlocks the computer for hours on end. If I was doing something important I will wait for OOM killer to maybe reap the evil children, but otherwise I just power cycle the system and add a note to put the swap file in fstab."
"I don&#x27;t know much about the medieval periods, but in the 16th century, people certainly didn&#x27;t bath very often.<p>They tended to wear fresh linen everyday, which did a remarkable job of cleaning the skin of dirt and sweat, then washed their clothes regularly.<p>&quot;Method&quot; historian Ruth Goodman has described trying this herself, and claimed that it was a very effective way of keeping clean, saying that even after a few weeks, she still lacked significant body odour."

"&gt; Consumers can pay for ad-free video subscription services like Spotify Premium or Hulu—why can’t they in search or social networking?

"In college, one of my computer science professors was giving a lecture in which he explained all the low level things (like setting up the stack) that go into calling a function. Then he compared it to the context switches that occur during multitasking. That comparison has stuck with me ever since.

"I&#x27;ve never liked the approach Linux kernel and userland take to memory exhaustion. Many people confidently asserts that it never happens. The somewhat better-informed suggest that it&#x27;s unreasonable to write programs that recover from memory exhaustion because unwinding requires allocation --- a curious belief, because there are many existence proofs of the contrary. Then we get a feedback loop where everyone uses overcommit because everyone believes that programs can&#x27;t recover from OOM, and people avoid writing OOM recovery code because they believe that everyone is using overcommit and allocation failure is unavoidable. And then they write kernel code and bring this attitude there.<p>Memory is just a resource. If you can recover from disk space exhaustion, you can recover from memory exhaustion. I think the current standard of memory discipline in the free software world is inadequate and disappointing."

"It&#x27;s odd, in that I never really thought about Caviar as a competitor to DoorDash -- but that&#x27;s because I know them mostly as the company that bought Zesty (just before Caviar itself was bought by Square). Zesty specializes in catered <i>group</i> meal delivery. The company I&#x27;m at now uses Zesty once a week; the company I was at before used them five days a week, and the company before <i>that</i> used a competitor (ZeroCater, I think) five days a week.<p>As far as I know, DoorDash wasn&#x27;t in that space before; I wonder if that&#x27;s part of the reason for the acquisition. (The alternative is that they may not be interested in that side of the business at all and shut it down.)"

"The idea that in scientific publication, more is better, makes little sense to me as a practicing scientist.  The scientific literature is already filled with papers with conclusions that are not well supported by the data, and that is after 50-80% of submissions are rejected.<p>To argue that publication should have fewer restrictions, one needs to show that the modest number of papers that are improperly rejected by every journal (not just the first submission) equals or outnumbers the overwhelming number of submissions that should not be published because they reflect a misunderstanding of their field or a misinterpretation of the data.  For many (most) scientists, the problem is not that important results are unpublished, the problem is that it is almost impossible to keep up with the current gated literature, particularly when that literature is full of mistakes.  While it is certainly true that some reviewers are biased and some ill-informed, most of the time papers are rejected because the authors did not communicate well (for papers that should be published) or because the authors did not understand that their data did not support their conclusion (papers that should be rejected).<p>The scientific literature needs a better signal to noise ratio, not more noise."

The FedNow Service would authenticate the sender’s bank and validate the payment message, for example, by verifying that the message meets the FedNow format specifications. Before the Reserve Bank executes the payment message, the service would place a provisional hold on funds in the master account of the sender’s bank and would then send an inquiry message to the receiver’s bank seeking confirmation that the receiver’s bank, among other things, maintains a valid account for the receiver included in the payment message received by the Reserve Bank. If the receiver’s bank sends a positive response to the inquiry, the FedNow Service would execute the payment for the Reserve Banks by sending a payment message forward with an advice of credit to the receiver’s bank and nearly simultaneously processing a final debits and final credit to the master accounts of the sender’s bank and receiver’s bank, respectively.104 The banks are responsible for debiting and crediting their customers’ accounts and providing further notification to their customers that the payment has been completed.

"Something that I found works well is just emailing influential people who you think would really benefit from your product and asking them for feedback. Since you&#x27;re not selling your product, people (even busy ones) do reply.

Most exchanges have an auction process that sets opening and closing prices. They let everyone get their orders in and then run an algorithm to find the price that will execute the most volume.<p>They could do the same process every 5 minutes and only allow stocks to trade in the auction. Then all of the resources used on pointless HFT could be used on something economically productive.

Thats a very One sided view.<p>Biotech is overly regulated today (for good reasons). Because of that the entrance barrier is very high. It costs a lot more money today to start and run a biotech company.<p>To run a clinical trial for FDA submission process will cost you from several $ million to $ 100+million. To bring a drug to the market is ~$1B.<p>Only big guys with deep pockets can afford the expenses. If anything biotech is getting consolidated and monopolized (similar to tech world where FANG own everything) just like the rest of the industries.<p>My prognostication for next 20 years - big pharma and a few other biotech giants will own everything promising in the biotech world.

"A lot of extensions are made because people need them for themselves, not to live of extension development.

All the development stuff can go into something like AUR on Archlinux, where users have to explicitly participate and accept more risk. And this is something not very evil browser vendor might be willing and be able to do.

"I interviewed for a software role in Amazon Business, had spent several years with a quite high engineering rank in Apple, and was warned by the hiring manager that the roles to be filled considered the people as, and i quote, &quot;fungible&quot; assets.<p>Pretty much the most damning confession the hiring committee could have admitted to, and I imagined a good-hearted warning.

"A long time ago I had to write a Windows custom control for text rendering. This was really hard to do in a performant way  once you dealt with different fonts, pages sizes, scrolling and all the other stuff we usually take for granted.

"Cassettes aren&#x27;t actually that bad. A local radio station I worked at for a while used them for reruns. With a good cassette deck, brand new chrome tapes and Dolby noise reduction, it&#x27;s hard to hear much of a difference between that and a digital recording. Cassettes only sounded low-fi because most people listened to cheap tapes on cheap players with cheap speakers. Even some of the better portable players from the 1990s sounded very transparent if you attached them to a good pair of headphones or a good stereo system.<p>I feel we reached transparency for professional analog recordings some time in the 1980s, and I would argue that this applies to analog film as well. Pee-Wee Herman&#x27;s Big Adventure (1985) and Top Gun (1986) don&#x27;t look blurry or grainy at all. Analog media kept improving until they were made obsolete. Everyone was trying to approach digital perfection long before it actually existed. Actually wanting artefacts and colouration is more of a recent phenomenon."

This can be defined by the distribution using the startup privileges.<p>So, why is this so difficult?"

Only when all of the squares had been created could you see the end product with the combined imagery created from the imaginations of artists who expanded upon the edge pixels from another artist.<p>Thanks for posting this.

"&gt; Meyer suspects one of the factors leading to this divide can be found in the numbers: according to her book, there are 500,000 words in the English language, but only 70,000 in French. This means that Anglophones are more likely to have the exact word to say what they want, whereas Francophones must often string together a series of words to communicate their message. This not only forces the French to be more creative with language, it also allows them to be more ambiguous with what they want to say. As a result, ‘non’ in France does not always mean ‘no’.<p>This is definitely a case of bad linguistics.<p>Without even cracking the nut of how many words are in either language,<p>* French tries to have an official authority while English does not. The academy is reluctant to admit new words, especially if they are borrowed, even when a word is otherwise in common use.<p>* English, like other Germanic languages, likes to compound words. French also compounds but it&#x27;s not as productive. Very successful English compounds drop spaces or hyphenate and get inducted into the dictionary. Lexical procreation.<p>N.B. A word being in a dictionary is a matter of judgment, as a common word can be missing or a word that is almost never used can be present!<p>* Where a word is needed but absent, one will be invented or borrowed. Speakers are not constrained to be &quot;creative&quot;  under the tyrrany of a limited lexicon from this time until the end of time.<p>* It&#x27;s not clear that a limited lexicon would mean playing games with a concept as simple as &quot;no&quot;. This seems strictly cultural.<p>* English may have, in some sense, 500k words but the vast majority of those are rare and not part of the principal vocabulary. And why would you think this is related to ways of expressing degrees between yes and no?<p>* Why should number of words be used to estimate the expressive power of a language?"

"The worst thing about this in my opinion is that as much as I personally dislike Trump, the WaPo has lowered the quality of its journalism tremendously over the past decade and so unfortunately Trump’s critiques of the WaPo are not lacking in substance.<p>Bezos should have stepped in to make certain that the WaPo improve the quality of its journalism even if the easiest path to profits is just to provide entertaining stories to the #resist partisans.<p>There is plenty to write serious investigative journalism about that will have the consequence of weakening Trump politically (if that is the goal) so there was no need to become a tabloid.<p>Arguably the WaPo’s reporting on Saudi Arabia led to the grudge match that culminated in outing Bezos’ philandering, and the subsequent major decrease in Bezos’ wealth.<p>KSA is led by an abhorrent group of royals, but the WaPo’s coverage of the disappearance of khashoggi was tabloidesque and immature."

"Ah, ever since I&#x27;m doing consulting prep (for a couple of weeks now), I have a new perspective on this. It&#x27;s just a new perspective, that I happen to trade in in for my soul, not as a price, but as a side effect really, but whatever. I guess that had to happen if you want to know what game the executive suite is playing :D<p>The question is: why wouldn&#x27;t they?<p>Big corporations exist for one reason which is brought about by a myriad of incentives from stakeholders (e.g. consumers, shareholders, employees and the state).<p>That reason is: <i>to generate as much profit as possible.</i> Some say it&#x27;s about growth or revenue, IMO those are all indirect ways to potentially generate more profit.<p>That&#x27;s it, that&#x27;s why big corporations exist. They&#x27;re quite mindless in that sense because this mostly comes about by the interaction of all the stakeholders.<p>So from Activision Blizzard its perspective, I applaud them. This is what they should be doing. There&#x27;s less financial pressure on employees (aka layoff season is probably even further away now), shareholders see more signs of their favorite currency in their eyes, the regulator&#x2F;state is simply picking a victim that isn&#x27;t as savvy and the consumers can play new amazing Warcraft games for years to come! Oh, and the victim has trouble to organize itself, so that helps.<p>In short, they are doing well.<p>For the state and economics researchers I&#x27;d say: if you care about wealth distribution to the people, then figure out how to get their money.<p>I wonder, if the state wants tax money so badly and the state is represented by the public, then why doesn&#x27;t the state compete or invest in companies? You can&#x27;t tax Activision Blizzard, but you definitely can tax a state owned company (right? Or is there something I&#x27;m missing)."

"When I was much younger, I remember being filled with wonder when I learned about the Skokie case[1], where the ACLU went to court to protect the rights of Nazis to hold a rally in a mostly-Jewish town.<p>&quot;Wait, they faced down criticism from every direction, and took a massive loss in donations, to stand up for the fundamental rights of people they despise?

"The main gripe I have with this analysis is it weds the short-term sprint cycle with customer exposure &amp; feedback. It then argues that, well, we can&#x27;t let customers change their minds every two weeks and Big Serious Things take 20 months to get working so this is just for like web contractors and stuff.<p>I don&#x27;t see agile as exclusively requiring you to expose everything you do to your end-users as you make it. I get that <i>it can accommodate</i> that if that&#x27;s what you want, but the real essence of it is about <i>de-risking</i> a project by breaking things down into shorter milestones.<p>Do you remember those Microsoft Press software management books? So good. One point was &quot;Beware of a Guy in a Room&quot;.[1] Which is to say, don&#x27;t let developers shut their door and go dark for months at a time without surfacing with something working. It can take a bit more work to adapt a big project into smaller &quot;working&quot; milestones and seem silly and inefficient, but in the end this helps avoid a lot of risks that can lead to deathmarches that can truly kill a project.<p>One way to adapt the &quot;customer&quot; aspect of agile is to not have an actual live customer but rather a &quot;voice of the market&quot; that the product manager represents. After all, you do want to empower them to course correct because the world can change over 8-20 months.

"I love the idea, but the implementation is IMHO poor. It doesn’t require non-nullables to be defined by the end of the constructor. Instead it moreorless adds a new type of NULL to the language (always a mistake) which causes parameters to throw runtime errors on <i>call</i> if they were not defined.<p>This adds up to essentially making everything nullable, regardless of if the type is defined as nullable, and adding an entire class of runtime errors that could have been avoided."

"There is a big difference between domain squatting and domain investing. Or simply buying domains that drop.<p>I don’t understand how you can say that it’s “domain squatting” on “your” name if you don’t own a trademark on the word or on your name. As others have pointed out, there may be other people who have the same name as you. How is it your name versus their name?  My definition of domain squatting is buying a domain name that already has a trademark on it. The “rule” states that even if a word has a trademark, if someone bought the domain before the tm holder applied for the tm, then the domain owner still can own the domain. As long as it was not registered in bad faith.<p>The key here is “bad faith”.<p>Python scripts are no longer necessary to grab expired domains, that’s what backorder services are for. I recommend backordering the names of all your current sites just in case you fail to renew the name. Backorder it on multiple services, as it truly is a race to see which service gets it."

"There is one word that every vendor hates: &quot;vendor agnostic&quot;. Minor differences in SQL dialects are not a bug, they are features for most vendors.<p>Most customers running on Amazon (or any cloud) want to move from having to maintain their own databases (which takes a lot of effort) to paying someone else do it. Amazon knows this.<p>This move looks like Amazon has everything to win and every other vendor has everything to lose. Even if they say the opposite (you can switch from Amazon to your own) - they know that extremely few customers have the will to operationalize their own databases. So they know that only the opposite will happen - customers will switch from self hosted to Amazon services. They have also been openly predatorial towards other open source databases (e.g. aws elasticsearch and mongo). No wonder all Amazon services already support this.<p>In that context, who is the target audience and what is the deployment model here? Are vendors going to integrate this directly into their databases? Or users have to run their own proxy instances? Or is it compiled into the application as a library?"

"Spent the last 6 months in Seoul and the surrounding cities in Korea. Never needed a car. You can literally do everything without a car, everything is a short walk. I truly believe it makes a huge positive impact on happiness when you can just walk anywhere instead of having to drive. Also you&#x27;ll notice that in Korea&#x2F;Japan there are way more small businesses and things to do (eg. karaoke, cafes, etc) because people of this. In America there&#x27;s relatively less to do because leaving the home is more of a hassle and less interesting, so people just stay in more.<p>My least favorite thing about living in America is the dependence on cars (outside of a select few cities like NYC). Now that my parents in the suburbs sold their spare car, whenever I go back to visit, I&#x27;m stranded there during the weekdays because the nearest bus stop is like a 40 minute walk, and the nearest subway would be maybe a 90 minute walk. If I need to go anywhere, I&#x27;m dependent on Uber&#x2F;Lyft. Even if I get access to a car, there&#x27;s relatively much less to do as I mentioned above."

"On the one hand, I like the idea of a free, open, and distributed internet, where no one company or government has the power to control what is distributed or discussed.

"&quot; they have proven themselves to be lawless and that lawlessness <i>has caused multiple tragic deaths</i>.&quot;<p>What insane nonsense. Whatever motivates mass murderers caused the deaths, not where they posted. They get rewarded with tons of attention from all forms of media, too.

They revel in it. 8chan disappearing doesn&#x27;t change that.<p>I&#x27;ve always favored all the mass media agreeing to not even mention the killers names, achievements, etc in favor of just belittling or dismissing them. Focus on everyone else in the tragedy instead. Make sure the abusers or killers get nothing out of it.

As though there never was a time when they didn’t love it.

"As a free expression absolutists I see no problem with private companies refusing service, as long as they are not breaking their contract. And ideally it should be perfectly fine to have whites-only restaurants, or do a discriminatory hiring practice and not hire any women. Because I see no logical reason why freedom of association should have any limits, as long as you are not bound by some obligations that you have agreed to.<p>As for people crying about how internet is getting censored - don&#x27;t be an impotent and start programming decentralized alternatives. Like Fediverse and Crypto devs do. If you really care about freedom that is. At this point it should be pretty clear that the major enabler of internet censorship is the whole paradigm of centralized services, because it concentrates too much power in one hands. In order to combat it we should create high-quality decentralized alternatives, where everyone owns a small chunk of the system and can only ban somebody from that specific chunk."

"A few random comments:<p>• Obviously, this is typeset with TeX.<p>• Though originally Knuth created TeX for books rather than single-page articles, he&#x27;s most familiar with this tool so it&#x27;s unsurprising that he&#x27;d use it to just type something out. (I remember reading somewhere that Joel Spolsky, who was PM on Excel, used Excel for everything.)<p>• To create the PDF, where most modern TeX users might just use pdftex, he seems to first created a DVI file with tex (see the PDF&#x27;s title “huang.dvi”), then gone via dvips (version 5.98, from 2009) to convert to PostScript, then (perhaps on another computer?) “Acrobat Distiller 19.0 (Macintosh)” to go from PS to PDF.<p>• If you find it different from the “typical” paper typeset with LaTeX, remember that Knuth doesn&#x27;t use LaTeX; this is typeset in plain TeX. :-) Unlike LaTeX which aims to be a “document preparation system” with “logical”&#x2F;“structured” (“semantic”) markup rather than visual formatting, for Knuth TeX is just a tool; typically he works with pencil and paper and uses a computer&#x2F;TeX only for the final typesetting, where all he needs is to control the formatting.<p>• Despite being typeset with TeX which is supposed to produce beautiful results, the document may appear very poor on your computer screen (at least it did when I first viewed it on a Linux desktop; on a Mac laptop with Retina display it looks much better though somewhat “light”). But if you zoom in quite a bit, or print it, it looks great. The reason is that Knuth uses bitmap (raster) fonts, not vector fonts like the rest of the world. Once bitten by “advances” in font technology (his original motivation to create TeX &amp; METAFONT), he now prefers to use bitmap fonts and completely specify the appearance (when printed&#x2F;viewed on a sufficiently high-resolution device anyway), rather than use vector fonts where the precise rasterization is up to the PDF viewer.<p>• An extension of the same point: everything in his workflow is optimized for print, not onscreen rendering. For instance, the PDF title is left as “huang.dvi” (because no one can look at it when printed), the characters are not copyable, etc. (All these problems are fixable with TeX too these days.)<p>• Note what Knuth has done here: he&#x27;s taken a published paper, understood it well, thought hard about it, and come up with (what he feels is) the “best” way to present this result. This has been his primary activity all his life, with <i>The Art of Computer Programming</i>, etc. Every page of TAOCP is full of results from the research literature that Knuth has often understood better than even the original authors, and presented in a great and uniform style — those who say TAOCP is hard to read or boring(!) just have to compare against the original papers to understand Knuth&#x27;s achievement. He&#x27;s basically “digested” the entire literature, passed it through his personal interestingness filter, and presented it an engaging style with enthusiasm to explain and share.<p>&gt; when Knuth won the Kyoto Prize after TAOCP Volume 3, there was a faculty reception at Stanford. McCarthy congratulated Knuth and said, &quot;You must have read 500 papers before writing it.&quot; Knuth answered, &quot;Actually, it was 5,000.&quot; Ever since, I look at TAOCP and consider that each page is the witty and insightful synthesis of ten scholarly papers, with added Knuth insights and inventions.<p>(<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.computationalcomplexity.org&#x2F;2011&#x2F;10&#x2F;john-mccarthy-1927-2011.html?showComment=1319546990817#c6154784930906980717"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.computationalcomplexity.org&#x2F;2011&#x2F;10&#x2F;john-mccart...</a>)<p>• I remember a lunchtime conversation with some colleagues at work a few years ago, where the topic of the Turing Award came up. Someone mentioned that Knuth won the Turing Award for writing (3 volumes of) TAOCP, and the other person did not find it plausible, and said something like “The Turing Award is not given for writing textbooks; it&#x27;s given for doing important research...” — but in fact Knuth did receive the award for writing TAOCP; writing and summarizing other people&#x27;s work is his way of doing research, advancing the field by unifying many disparate ideas and extending them. When he invented the Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm in his mind he was “merely” applying Cook&#x27;s theorem on automata to a special case, when he invented LR parsing he was “merely” summarizing various approaches he had collected for writing his book on compilers, etc. Even his recent volumes&#x2F;fascicles of TAOCP are breaking new ground (e.g. currently simply trying to write about Dancing Links as well as he can, he&#x27;s coming up with applying it to min-cost exact covers, etc.<p>Sorry for long comment, got carried away :-)"

"People here seem to be missing a few things.<p>1: The <i>737 family, including the 737 MAX, still use manual&#x2F;hydraulic controls</i>, not fly-by-wire. A computer failure isn&#x27;t supposed to be as catastrophic as it would in a fully fly-by-wire system. 737 pilots are already trained on other automatic system failures, such as a pitch trim motor runaway.<p>2: The original design of MCAS had a limited scope - stop pitch instabilities from causing an uncontrolled pitch-up into a stall in high AoA and high power regimes, such as just after takeoff. It read from both a G-sensor and the AoA vane and both sensors had to be reading excessive values for the system to trigger. This was probably the justification for not requiring higher levels of reliability.<p>3: The plane was found to have handling issues in slow flight regimes. In order to improve the handling, Boeing engineers modified MCAS to be active in more of the flight regime, removing one of the sensor readings. Now it would trigger if it detected the plane was near a stall, even in level flight without a high G loading. It is unclear whether MCAS was recertified within Boeing for continuous use. Wikipedia states &quot;The FAA did not conduct a safety analysis on the changes. It had already approved the previous version of MCAS, and the agency&#x27;s rules did not require it to take a second look because the changes did not affect how the plane operated in extreme situations.&quot;<p>4: Pilots could not disable MCAS without disabling electric trim control. In at least the LionAir case, the pilots did disable the electric trim, but were unable to re-trim the plane manually against the aerodynamic forces of their dive. They re-enabled the electric trim to re-trim the aircraft, and MCAS re-triggered and put them back in the same situation. Remember, <i>these aircraft use manual controls</i>. The pilots need to put a serious amount of force into the control column when the plane is out of trim and at a high airspeed. This greatly diminishes their ability to do anything else.<p>5: Both accident aircraft were missing an <i>optional safety feature</i> - the AoA disagree warning. Both aircraft experienced a failure of one of their AoA vanes. I don&#x27;t recall whether these failures happened in flight or before the flight, but such a warning would have likely stopped the pilots from taking off.<p>6: The single computer issue was not uncovered until simulator testing after the crashes. It is not directly related to the MCAS problems.<p>Wikipedia is your friend, as usual. <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Maneuvering_Characteristics_Augmentation_System"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Maneuvering_Characteristics_Au...</a><p>Here&#x27;s even more detailed information: <a href=""http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.b737.org.uk&#x2F;mcas.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.b737.org.uk&#x2F;mcas.htm</a>"

"It&#x27;s amazing how some parts of the kernel barely get maintained explicitly. A year or two ago I was digging through the block driver subsystem and at some point took a look at the loop device as a simple reference. I learned that it supports encryption, because that was actually the only way to implement encrypted volumes about 15 years ago. Dmcrypt didn&#x27;t exist yet. I would be surprised if anyone still uses that feature, yet nobody bothered removing it. Loop is mostly ever touched if anything changes in the block layer. It was the first block device to be switched over to multi queue though, most likely due to its simplicity. Which is most likely also the reason nobody bothers becoming the official maintainer."

&quot;Unlike web SSL servers there is no need to send a certificate back to the owner. LF is a global shared data store and therefore makes use of itself to publish certificates.&quot;<p>Nice! Thinking a bit about this - this sounds like it has real potential vis-a-vis traditional CA. With a (many) globally trusted db - it sounds quite feasible for eg Mozilla or Debian to simply store (or &quot;bless&quot;&#x2F;trust) any number of root certs - and record that in lf.<p>And the same could be done for signing binaries (whether via x509 or some other scheme - &quot;all&quot; that is needed is some way to &quot;discover&quot; trust of the signing key after all - be that a gnupg key or a x509 cert etc).

"The hardest part of working with really smart people is that they can rationalize pretty much anything. Worse still, if they have been on the project for years and you’re the new guy, you’re working from a deficit of knowledge and they’ve had plenty of time to cook up a “coherent but wrong” model of the universe. The only thing that saves a group like that is humility. Trying to see the system through the eyes of the new person helps loads. I call people out for complaining about “having to” train a new guy. It’s “getting to”, man. Take advantage of the opportunity.<p>The first time I worked with a stable group where everyone was a smart as me, even the old new guy with a massive inferiority complex who managed to sneak one really profound comment into every meeting, there was a lack of humility on everybody’s part and things did not go well.  Planning meetings were exhausting because you could get them to bash their own old work but couldn’t get them to admit to needing to change process at all. I should have quit, but I had a string of experiences with persistence paying off and I had not been beaten yet. That was the first time, and my current employer the second (I should probably quit here, too).<p>Cognitive dissonance is at its absolute worst in the head of a scary-smart person."

"Google did not create reCAPTCHA. They bought it; it was started by Luis von Ahn, who went on to create Duolingo.<p>When reCAPTCHA was created, the alternative was CAPTCHA, which tried to impede bots but did not generate any social benefit. This was the genius of the original reCAPTCHA concept: the time taken to &#x27;confirm humanity&#x27; could be channeled into the socially-useful endeavor of digitizing books.  Capture some of the heat emissions of impeding bots for a useful purpose, rather than letting it all go to waste.<p>Now, yes, Google is using it to train their self-driving car AI, and there&#x27;s a bunch else happening in it to connect to Google&#x27;s surveillance apparatus. There&#x27;s much to legitimately criticize there.  I personally don&#x27;t view training Google&#x27;s proprietary AI as the same kind of intrinsically altruistic purpose as digitizing the world&#x27;s pre-digital books.<p>But putting the entire concept on blast with erroneous history that can be corrected with about 60 seconds on Wikipedia doesn&#x27;t help the argument at all."

Namebase is a domain registrar and onramp for the Handshake blockchain.<p>Handshake is an experimental peer-to-peer root DNS. It&#x27;s a protocol that&#x27;s similar to Bitcoin, except that instead of using the coins for money, you use Handshake coins to register names on the Handshake blockchain. Handshake names are top-level domain names (.com, .io,. org, etc), and they&#x27;re different from normal domain names because they&#x27;re unstoppable; no one can censor, tamper with, or seize your name from you. Furthermore, Handshake names are associated with public keys, which enables SSL without relying on Certificate Authorities (a failure point in the security of DNS today).<p>Namebase is a domain registrar and exchange for Handshake (we&#x27;re a separate company from the Handshake Foundation). You can register and manage Handshake names on our website, and if you don&#x27;t have any coins, you can buy some using dollars or bitcoin on our exchange.<p>We&#x27;re looking for a generalist marketer to run content marketing, community events, influencer marketing, SEO, and various growth experiments. If you have experience in developer relations that&#x27;s a big plus!<p>Our mission at Namebase is to give an unstoppable name to everyone on the internet. Handshake makes it possible to have DNS that can&#x27;t be shut down — even the Great Firewall of China can&#x27;t censor Handshake names. We have the opportunity to change how the internet works, and our team is small enough that you&#x27;ll have immense impact on our software development and company direction.

"Essence from this site (from my understanding, read the whole article):<p>WhatsApp is using VoIP iOS features to display end2end encrypted notifications in iOS. This loophole will be closed on iOS13. So either WhatsApp does not display any notifications text on iOS13 with WhatsApp or WhatsApp will remove end2end encryption for the sake of having notifications with text on iOS.<p>This is really alarming for privacy. Seems Apple does not care about privacy and comfort unless it&#x27;s software from Apple.<p>I just hope WhatsApp will stay strong and never give up on end2end encryption."

"My 8-year-old daughter has paid a lot more attention to Roblox than Minecraft lately. Being able to connect with friends there is definitely a factor, but I think she&#x27;s also drawn in by the seemingly endless supply of new content. One game or genre getting boring or frustrating? There are dozens of not-bad others waiting right there, clamoring for attention. And honestly, that makes me a bit uncomfortable: it feels like it&#x27;s actively encouraging a short attention span and shallow engagement.<p>The thing that I miss most about her Minecraft phase is that as far as I can tell, at least on a tablet (where she usually plays) Roblox is all about consuming other people&#x27;s content rather than creatively building your own. That makes me sad. I&#x27;m sure she&#x27;ll shift gears again eventually (in fact, she and her friends have been occasionally picking Minecraft back up lately), so maybe I shouldn&#x27;t be so antsy waiting for that time to come."

"&gt; with intent or reason to believe that it is to be used to the injury of the United States<p>There are two versions of the United States.<p>1. The People of. The ones that benefit from whistleblowers. They are not injured when classified information is distributed - they get valuable insight they don&#x27;t normally get into the doings of their employees (government officials that take their salary from taxes). The ones upon whose whims the government has power, and allegedly upon whose whims that power can be revoked.<p>2. The Government of. This is the actual entity of power in the USA, and probably has been forever (though the way the Executive branch reacted to union riots makes me wonder - it was genuinely concerned it was about to be deposed, I wonder if that was a valid fear?) This is injured when word gets out about it breaking its own laws - it makes the USA look bad, it destroys trust and thus the ability for the government to maintain control of the people, etc. This is a living creature and that&#x27;s what many 2nd amendmenters don&#x27;t seem to realize, that the government of the USA isn&#x27;t The People of, it&#x27;s an organism that will maintain its form by any means necessary. Legal ones are the safest, illegal and immoral ones if needs must. Anybody challenging this power is an enemy of #2, even if they aren&#x27;t an enemy of #1. Great examples are some of our industry&#x27;s favorite persons of interest, namely Snowden, Manning. Back in the day it was Civil Rights activists (note I&#x27;m not drawing a comparison between current leaks and that era, just saying it&#x27;s another example of enemies of #2 but not #1).<p>As per the article, the line &quot;be used to the injury of the USA&quot; is obviously being interpreted by the current administration to mean &quot;to the injury of #2&quot; above."
"I personally think that it is all matter of risk. The risk of contract work (which is what the agile manifesto writers were facing most of their careers [they are all consultants), is building something that the customer do not want or did not intend do. The actual tech risk is very low (e.g. ruby on rails on postgres) since most of them use mature technology. In this case the agile manifesto make sense - I.e. we can build something really fast and literally ask the customer if this is what he wants every two weeks.<p>When you building hard tech products (e.g. borg or tensorflow), the actual risk is technology and competition, and since this is new technology, there are not that many customers. In this case the risk is in the architecture (i.e. it would be hard to change the core architecture) and in the technology, since you do not know what kind of application will be build on top of this new technology. In addition, you face general competition risk, since the market can usually absorb only one dominant architecture.<p>So in this case, you invest much more time in design and careful construction."

"The thing which is not.<p>In most mathematical logic systems &quot;false&quot; or &quot;⊥&quot; has the nice property that anything can be derived from it (⊥ -&gt; p, for any sentence p).

How much value does like and other sharing buttons provide to anyone other than Facebook&#x2F;Google&#x2F;Twitter these days?

This is totally ridiculous. Every major political issue in the USA has been injected with a “protected” group so any criticism can be silenced as it now fits the criteria for hate speech.
"In many ways, she embodied the spirit of our current cultural moment. Obsessed with one&#x27;s own victim-hood and &quot;self-esteem&quot;, and the synergistic expansion of one&#x27;s sense of personal grievance that can be obtained by viewing one in the light of the other, recursively, ad-infinitum. Her death can be seen as symbolic of the diminishing relevance of these qualities. Power via wielding guilt, and resilience via narcissism can only persist for so long, after all."

"One other example of the flaw (I think) that came out in pop culture was a few years ago during the Serial podcast about Adnan Syed.<p>Near the end when the hosts were wrestling about whether they should think he was guilty, the interviewer&#x27;s friend (the producer? Dana?) came on and shared why she thought he was guilty, and it was this convoluted argument about if Syed was innocent, he&#x27;d have to be the unluckiest guy in the world, so therefore he was probably guilty.<p>Her point was that it was just too strong a coincidence that it was <i>his</i> ex-girlfriend that got killed, on that particular day during some period of time when he didn&#x27;t have an alibi, etc etc.<p>That seemed to me like it could be a bad Bayesian argument - like it would have been a good argument had Serial selected a random citizen to interview, but they selected someone they already knew was connected to the story. Murders happen and by definition the circumstances are always highly unlikely because murders are so rare, and innocent people closely connected to the circumstances of the crime are very, very unlucky by definition. You can&#x27;t point to that unluckiness as evidence that they&#x27;re probably guilty."

This allows easy and honest comparison between them, and makes it trivial to go back to the old reliable path when the spiffy new one starts showing flaws.  The difference between changing a console variable to get a different behavior versus running an old exe, let alone reverting code changes and rebuilding, is significant.</i><p>This is great advice, always being able to compare and easily switch between parallel implementations is key to maintaining systems long into the future and not doing the v2 rewrites every 6 months.<p>Creating a solid system that doesn&#x27;t have breaking changes, but new paths&#x2F;flows to use at will is key to debugging between the two and maintaining a live app&#x2F;game&#x2F;system&#x2F;infrastructure.<p>Parallel implementations sometime takes more work and more care to signatures and surface&#x2F;facades in the app, but the benefits in debugging, comparing multiple implementations and easing into new systems when they are fully ready, not rushed, is iterative knowledge from the trenches of the shippers that was learned through pain."

"It&#x27;s a futile quest to find the perfect programming language. Any language that gains popularity will face a vocal demand for new features at some point. But it&#x27;s not just about adding new concepts. Programmers also want new shortcuts for existing features to save them a few keystrokes. That then entails issuing recommendations on when to use such shortcuts to keep code consistent.<p>There are plenty of small languages, but they lack popularity or rich libraries. The only language I can think of that remains in widespread use and is fairly small in language size is C.<p>I&#x27;m strongly in the camp that small languages are preferable to large ones and wish language designers would follow this principle more closely. But small does not necessarily mean more readable. And language syntax design remains a neglected aspect of programming language design."

"Benchmarking is hard -- I&#x27;ve spent far more time investigating it then I ever wanted to. Much of the advice in this article matches the advice I give when people are foolish enough to ask me (though CPU pinning can have very odd results for systems which expect to use all of a CPU&#x27;s cores). However, there are two related points where I respectfully disagree with the author: disabling ASLR is probably not a good idea for most people; and using minimum values is almost never a good idea. Ultimately, the traditional idea that programs have a single performance number doesn&#x27;t generally hold true on modern systems: one needs to accept that programs have a set of performance numbers. The Stabilizer paper [1] does a very good job of articulating this, IMHO, and does so particularly in the context of ASLR. As soon as you accept the idea that programs don&#x27;t have a single performance point, it then becomes fairly clear that the best way to get a good idea of a program&#x27;s performance is to run it as many times as possible and compute some basic statistics over that. ASLR is one aspect where simply running a program enough times gives you some idea of the overall performance of the program. Some modern benchmarking tools make calculating reasonable statistics fairly painless (e.g. things like Criterion for Rust).

"I used to be a big support of Sonic for years, but have changed my mind as of late.<p>They skipped my block for fiber, and I thought there could be some issue (like the fact that a Muni electric line runs down it) that might make it impossible for them to install it. So I asked their tech support if it was going to someday come, or never come.<p>Sonic would not give me any information. They wouldn&#x27;t confirm or deny that they&#x27;d ever be able to install fiber.  They said it would probably happen eventually, but refused to provide even a ballpark figure like &quot;next month, next year, 2 years, 5 years or 10 years&quot;.<p>I finally got a response saying that there were overloaded utility poles on my block and the next block, and that was what was preventing them from stringing fiber. They even sent a map showing which poles were at fault.<p>So I went to the PUC and worked with them to get the poles replaced, all while sticking with Sonic&#x27;s slow and expensive ADSL.<p>Once the poles were replaced, I went back to Sonic and they still refused to say if or when they&#x27;d be able to install fiber. Finally (several years have gone by now) someone from the responsible department said that there would never be fiber on my block because of the Muni electric line. What? That&#x27;s what I asked in the 1st place!?!<p>After that someone else replied and said that they could actually do it on Muni electric blocks now, but they again refused to give me any semblance of a timeframe. Finally, someone else at Sonic admitted that it could be a very long time, perhaps more than 7 years, because &quot;it&#x27;s as time consuming to do permitting for a block as it is for a neighborhood&quot; and my block wasn&#x27;t a priority.<p>That&#x27;s all fine, but if so why didn&#x27;t they say so in the first place rather than giving me a run-around for 3 or 4 years? Wait, I think I know the answer: if they admit that fiber isn&#x27;t coming any time soon (if at all) people might go to a competitor for faster service!<p>Pretty cynical, and not what I&#x27;d hope for in an ISP committed to transparency. But there you have it: as far as I&#x27;m concerned, Sonic just isn&#x27;t as cool as they seemed.<p>TL&#x2F;DR: If Sonic skips your block, they ain&#x27;t coming back any time soon, if at all, even if the issue that made them skip is corrected."

"Non nullability is probably one of the most important concepts I&#x27;ve learned. People can talk your ear off about macros or about borrow checking or whatever cool feature is in their favorite languages. But non nullability isn&#x27;t a feature as much as the removal of a terrible one: types being automatically unifiable with null.<p>What does that mean? Well basically that every single (reference) type in most languages comes with an implicit &quot;and null&quot;. String in Java? More like &quot;String and null&quot;. Car object? Actually it&#x27;s &quot;Car and null&quot;.<p>Why is this a bad thing? Well null is a very specific type with a very specific meaning, but because it&#x27;s automatically included with every type, people end up using it for a bunch of situations where a different type or value would work. Let&#x27;s take a simple parser. A naive implementation, upon reaching the end of the string, might just return null. After all, nothing has been found. But that&#x27;s not a null value, that&#x27;s an EndOfString value! The moment you pass that value out of the context of the function, you need to remember that null means EndOfString. Or maybe the string you&#x27;re passing in is a null value in the first place. It&#x27;d be tempting to return out null, right? Except you&#x27;ve now lost information on whether the string itself was null, or if something happened in the parse function that caused it to return null.<p>That isn&#x27;t to say null is wholly evil. There&#x27;s certainly uses for null. But it&#x27;s often way better to contain its use with Option or Maybe, essentially wrappers that detail &quot;hey, this value could be null&quot;. These wrappers are <i></i>not<i></i> unifiable with regular values, which forces you to think about where values can and cannot be null.<p>I totally understand if language designers want to omit features that they deem unnecessary or overcomplicated. I get it if you want a language sans generics or sans macros. But I don&#x27;t understand keeping a feature that has caused far too much pain and encouraged far too many bad practices."

"Frankly, I think this is a bunch of complete nonsense.

"One of the more interesting (to me at least) aspects of the warming trend of both the atmosphere and the oceans is that for each degree C increase in the mean atmospheric temperature increases its water carrying capacity on the order of 4.2 quadrillion kilograms. Rising ocean temperatures, combined with rising air temperatures are increasing the rate of evaporation of sea water into the air.<p>The effect of this is transporting more water in the air over longer distances. This &quot;side effect&quot; of global warming will likely make <i>all</i> of our past observations of precipitation rates in any given region completely moot. It also makes suspect any extrapolation of current precipitation trends into the future.<p>My reading of the current literature suggests to me that we might have an opposite problem, which is massive flooding in areas on a regular basis where previously they considered such floods &quot;100 year&quot; or &quot;1000 year&quot; storms.<p>What every climate scientist I have talked with agrees with, is that the current climate is being <i>destabilized</i> relative to historical records.

"I expect a lot of downvotes for this post from people who have not had experience working with people in fashion.<p>Investors should be weary of people from the fashion industry.
I say this as someone who has both a computer science degree and a fashion design degree, and 90% of my friends were in the fashion industry at some point. Coming from tech, you&#x27;ll find people here are much flakier and just unreliable. In the NYC fashion scene in particular, people have huge egos and they don&#x27;t always act out of pragmatism or logic. The tendency to keep up appearances manifests itself in many ways. Look at Barney&#x27;s, it appears great on the outside, but recently considered bankruptcy before receiving a capital injection.<p>Recently, I went into one of the top streetwear brands in the world, a staff member tried to start a fist fight with me after a piece of paper fell out of a hat, and I refused to pick it up and told them to screw off after the guy tried to disrespect me in front of my girlfriend. I&#x27;ve never been to a retail store where a staff member told a customer &quot;meet me outside p___y&quot;, but that is the nature of streetwear culture in NYC. In case you aren&#x27;t aware, these streetwear stores in NYC have BOUNCERS. Let that soak in. They&#x27;re just accustomed to bullying customers because people are so desperate to buy clothing that they are willing to put up with the nonsense. They particularly like to single out mainland Chinese who don&#x27;t realize (or maybe don&#x27;t care) when these staff are disrespecting them, and, since I&#x27;m Asian, the guy who picked the fight thought I would not stand up for myself. If you want more examples of ridiculousness of streetwear, search &quot;ym bape compilation&quot; on YouTube. This dude loves the clothing brand called &quot;Bape&quot; and goes around and assaults everyone he sees wearing the brand Supreme.<p>There&#x27;s economic demand and money to be made here, but just know the demographic you&#x27;re dealing with. The customers and investees are of the same thread.  I&#x27;m looking to start a fashion tech company myself, and aren&#x27;t intimidated by potential competitors considering how disjoint these two worlds are, both network-wise and culturally. The typical engineer won&#x27;t see the value of all this vain-ness, and people in fashion business aren&#x27;t always the most reasonable people. 
A UX designer I work with recently told me a story of how they were redesigning a website for a top fashion brand, and the brand requested they make the shopping experience as UN-usable as possible and difficult for people to actually make a purchase (but it works I guess). At any rate Investors, find a leader who can bridge that gap while still being able to attract engineering talent.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, you can fund leaders in the FashionTech who are completely unreasonable, and even incompetent, but the company will still do well since product-market fit and demand 
will outstrip all other factors, until something like this happens. One of my professors owns a set of retail stores in NYC that was acquired by one of the largest clothing manufacturers in the US, but they did not know a single thing about accounting, business operations, engineering, and non-artistic things. Super unreliable, super unprofessional professor but they had a really good intuition for branding.<p><i>Luxury brands, corporations (Adidas, Nike), and the LVMH conglomerate are a slightly different story</i>"

"I lived in a city with extensive public transportation infrastructure (Moscow) for 7 years without a car. TBH, I would not trade my current suburban US lifestyle for a high density city.

Job not within walking distance (which it rarely is)? Say hello to 1-2hrs of daily commute (about 35 min of which for me was walking). Kid has hobbies that aren&#x27;t within walking distance? Pain.

"One thing that intrigues me about null is that conceptions of null seem to divide into two main families.<p>In the first, a type nullable(T) is constructed from a type T by simply adjoining a &quot;Null&quot; value to it. So, a nullable integer type could take the values {Null, 0, 1, -1, 2, ...}<p>In the second, nullable(T) is more like a &quot;box&quot; that you have to get the value out of. This is what Haskell is doing with its Just &amp; Maybe. Here the values of our nullable int would be {Nothing, Just 0, Just 1, ...}<p>That&#x27;s actually a fairly big difference. For instance, in the first model of null, nullable(nullable(T)) = nullable(T), but in the second, those are distinct types.<p>Another big distinction is that in the first model, nullable(T) is a superset of T, where in the second, it&#x27;s not.<p>I haven&#x27;t seen anyone give a name to this distinction or talk about when the first is more useful vs. the second."
"It&#x27;s downright ridiculous to complain about companies taking perfectly legal steps to reduce their tax burden.<p>As the oft-quoted US judge Learned Hand said:<p>&gt; Anyone may arrange his affairs so that his taxes shall be as low as possible; he is not bound to choose that pattern which best pays the treasury. There is not even a patriotic duty to increase one&#x27;s taxes.
Over and over again the Courts have said that there is nothing sinister in so arranging affairs as to keep taxes as low as possible. Everyone does it, rich and poor alike and all do right, for nobody owes any
public duty to pay more than the law demands"

"Scott talks about how devs don&#x27;t do anything to be seen yet if you look at his twitter stream it&#x27;s mostly just him tweeting his own posts and retweeting other &quot;famous&quot; developers.

I got an email 3 days ago asking me to reset my password due to &quot;system updates&quot; and initially assumed it was just a phishing email. Since gmail is pretty aggressive about filtering those I looked into it more and realized it was genuine which made me even more confused because I couldn&#x27;t imagine what sort of &quot;system updates&quot; they could&#x27;ve done that would require a password reset for all users. I kind of assumed they were covering up a breach so I wasn&#x27;t at all surprised to see this headline. How scummy.

"My favorite sushi-restaurant SugarFish was originally a take-away-sushi shop, the sushi is very high quality and somewhat inexpensive for the quality ($40 a meal). Also dine-in lines are consistently super long (they don’t take reservations), so I like to order pick-up &#x2F; take-out. Except, now they force you to order take-out through Postmates which charges a large 15% fee and a flat service-charge (that I don’t recall but will update here when sugar fish opens). Sucks because I love the restaurant but really don’t appreciate paying Postmates fees when I’m picking it up myself. When you call in an order they auto-direct you to Postmates."
"We wouldn&#x27;t tolerate the existence of an Islamist site that glorified and helped perpetrate mass incidents of terror against our society.

In no way should society accept it.  It&#x27;s simple societal self-defense.  Root out the terrorists wherever they may congregate, regardless of whichever flavor of terrorist they happen to be."
"Benchmarking is hard and the best combination of configuration settings for one benchmark, measurement one property (e.g. run-time or branch-misses) might not be useful for another benchmark.<p>If we look for example on disabling turbo-boost (the first point on the list in the article), then there is some evidence that this might increase the variance of benchmarks that measure the amount of cache references. This might also be the case for dropping the file system caches.<p>The same can be seen for disabling address space randomization: It seems to increase the variability when measuring the wall-clock but decreasing the variability when measuring the number of branch misses.<p>Furthermore setting the process priority or the CPU governor might not have any effect at all. Setting the process priority might even increase the variability of your measurements due to e.g. priority inversion.<p>Setting the CPU affinity, preferably using CPU sets (<a href=""http:&#x2F;&#x2F;man7.org&#x2F;linux&#x2F;man-pages&#x2F;man7&#x2F;cpuset.7.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;man7.org&#x2F;linux&#x2F;man-pages&#x2F;man7&#x2F;cpuset.7.html</a>), seems to be helpful most of the time, but only really plays out if your benchmarking system is running other resource intensive processes.<p>On a busy system disabling turbo boost might increase the variability of your benchmarks too.<p>For the evidence: I ran the lean4 benchmarking suite with different environment configurations multiple times and looked at the standard deviation, a presentation covering the results can be found at <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pp.ipd.kit.edu&#x2F;~bechberger&#x2F;2m.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pp.ipd.kit.edu&#x2F;~bechberger&#x2F;2m.pdf</a>.<p>Overall the best environment setup seems to really depend on the state of your benchmarking system, the benchmarks themselves and the properties you focus on.<p>P.S.: Three configurations that are not in the article but can be helpful are preheating your CPU with CPU bound task (thermal capacity of CPUs…), letting your system rest quietly between the program runs, syncing the file system and disabling the swap.
P.P.S.: An automatic environment configuration selector is currently being developed for temci (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;temci.readthedocs.io&#x2F;en&#x2F;latest&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;temci.readthedocs.io&#x2F;en&#x2F;latest&#x2F;</a>, I&#x27;m its author), this will help tailoring the configuration to your setup and benchmarks."

"&gt; Think of monads as a way to overload a semicolon. It might sound a little crazy at first, but imagine being able to override the semicolon to reduce boilerplate in specific code blocks. That&#x27;s basically how monads are used in practice.<p>Lol, this resonated well. It is both brilliant but also extremely confusing (talking with experience). In my previous company, when we collaborated while researching Monads, we ended up in this conclusion as well.

"This post repeatedly refers to 8chan as &quot;lawless&quot; and &quot;unmoderated&quot; but it is neither. As a whole, it is a public website subject to US law, complete with DMCA and search warrant contact forms. The sitewide rule is that all content must comply with US law.<p>The media also keeps saying 8chan, 8chan, 8chan over and over, when it is really just the one most popular board (&quot;pol&quot;) that is being discussed. But there are hundreds of boards on the site for different topics, which are moderated separately and according to their own rules.<p>It seems like most of the outrageous incitement to violence people have posted on 8chan would be illegal under Brandenburg v. Ohio (speech is illegal if it will lead to imminent lawless action), given the mostly-valid assumption there will be readers of the post who are both radicalized and armed. This seems like the way to take down most of the violent content on 8chan if anyone would think about it for more than 5 seconds.<p>This seems like a knee-jerk reaction to moral panic and bad PR, not a solution to anything. Cloudflare would have been in a better position to actually <i>change</i> 8chan if they had kept them on and pressured them."

"That a crazy person posts a screed somewhere then commits mass murder is not by itself sufficient reason to destroy the forum where they posted their screed.  It&#x27;s not remotely clear to me that 8chan glorified previous mass murders -- of course, I&#x27;ve not looked, but then, Cloudflare doesn&#x27;t post any evidence of this either.  But even 8chan they did, that&#x27;s essentially what the media is doing every time they give wall-to-wall coverage to any mass murder -- future would be mass murderers may fantasize about being the one the news media talk about next.  No one talks about de-platforming CNN.  Before we deplatform the 8chans of the world, at the very least we should have some evidence of how they failed to moderate content, and we should give them a chance to fix it."

"Does the PRI formula seem nonsensical to anyone? Facility number * 8 + severity level = PRI. At first looking at the example, I was thinking it would be an easy way to look at the last digit to determine severity (0-7), but since the result of facility number * 8 could contain any final digit, so that&#x27;s a no go. Since severity is 0-7, and one multiplies facility by 8, no numbers would overlap, so one could eventually get used to the ranges and understand that, for example, PRIs 32-39 have something to do with auth (auth is facility 4, times 8 = 32, + 0 for emergency, up to +7 for debug), with 32 being an emergency and 39 being debug, but it seems unintuitive unless you&#x27;re a sysadmin that sees these frequently.<p>It seems like simply concating the facility and severity level would give a much more intuitive at a glance understanding of what&#x27;s going on, and make it easier to awk all, say, emergency severity levels since they&#x27;d all end in 0, or awk for all cron facilities, as they would start with 09, or all FTP errors (FTP facility 11 + error 3, 113). Range would be 000 (for kernel, emergency) to 237 (for local 23, debug). Of course, I don&#x27;t know anything about syslogs except what I learned in this article, so maybe this is totally off base."

"The article is a bit ironic. It apparently talks about people who don&#x27;t learn and don&#x27;t change but suggests to them to just go and &quot;find a new profession&quot;...<p>A new grad, compared to a 10 year veteran :D. Yes sure, it levels the playing field, totally. As if language and frameworks would mean anything. I don&#x27;t even want to know what kind of &quot;veterans&quot; would compare to a new grad. If you are worth anything at what you are doing, you would kick any smaller team of new grads out of the park, even when working alone, in a language you don&#x27;t know and with a framework you don&#x27;t know. New grads essentially know nothing about software engineering, nada...<p>It&#x27;s baffling to me how any company would think otherwise. Perhaps they should review their hiring policies then."

"For a person who does not code very large programs in Python, this looks scary and like something that is hardly &quot;only one way to do it&quot; and that the most elegant solution gives you what you want. How I import things (or the libraries I depend on!) affects how I can write my tests? Really?<p>My own Python scripts are typically single-screen in length. And one-off stuff, where they either work or don&#x27;t, basically.<p>Is this stuff really what developers of large-scale Python programs have to take into account? Or is this blog post misinformed, because there is an obviously better and standard way?"
"I&#x27;ve been approached a few times by Amazon recruiters, I reply back with my salary and profit share demands and that usually shuts them up.<p>I guess that they must have some luck picking up junior developers from Europe, or maybe people who like the idea of living in the US or Canada for a few years so are willing to take the cut."
"I don&#x27;t have faith in that chart. Average US internet speed is 120 mbps?! Do they mean advertised max speed? No way the average internet household speed is that fast. Maybe half. Maybe.

They are charting megabits not megabytes. That is more in line with what I would have thought.<p>So Germany averages 10mbps?! That is terrible."
"I am the author of the paper. First of all, thank you all for the valuable feedback!<p>I (re-)discovered PROLOG only a few months ago after having learned it superficially in the 90&#x27;s. Then I wanted my own, hackable interpreter, and started to read books about PROLOG implementation. I found them to be too complex for my needs, so I finally sat down and asked myself &quot;If I were a PROLOG interpreter, what would I do?&quot; Then those six slides materialized in my head.<p>In the meantime, I have written an interpreter that is mostly compatible to DEC-10 PROLOG, have read Clocksin, Boizumault, and half of O&#x27;Keefe (and skimmed through a few others), and I am quite enjoying the tour so far! PROLOG is a fascinating language, and there are so many things to discover!"

"If Hy could resolve its problems with let being moved to contrib and attracted enough manpower to reach 1.0 I think it could attract significant mindshare.

"On the one hand, this seems like a real missed opportunity by Mozilla.  As Chrome reigns in extensions that conflict with Google&#x27;s business model, this is a reason to use Firefox.<p>BUT - extensions are also often the cause of a slow and frustrating Firefox experience, which then leads folks to talk about how Chrome is better-performing&#x2F;faster (I&#x27;ve been guilty of this myself in the past).  Mozilla needs to make sure Firefox is keeping pace with Chrome, which they&#x27;ve presumably decided means de-emphasizing extensions.<p>That said, not sure why Mozilla needs to de-emphasize donation buttons."

"To me this is incredibly ridiculous, millions more dumped into the brain draining maw of finance."
"One thing that I think is getting lost in this discussion is the role of intent on currency manipulation.<p>Switzerland has the strongest currency in the world due to the country&#x27;s reputation for governmental and financial stability. This makes Swiss labor extremely expensive for reasons mostly outside of their control, and the Swiss government has tried (and largely failed) to remedy this. Technically, this is devaluation but given the circumstances and Switzerland&#x27;s relatively small footprint in the labor market, it&#x27;s understandable and fairly benign.<p>The Fed cutting interest rates in 2009 had the effect of weakening the USD relative to what it would have been. But the intent of the policy was not to steal a share of the export market, but rather to provide stimulus during a deep recession.<p>Japan has been in ultra-low growth and ultra-low inflation for decades. To fend off the threat of deflation and economic contraction, it ran the printing press and cut interest rates. Which, again, devalue the currency but stealing export share is not a major intent.<p>I&#x27;m not sure what the appropriate definition of &quot;currency manipulator&quot; should be but, while China&#x27;s currency policy history is a strange and variable beast, yesterday&#x27;s devaluation was clearly a different case than those above. And depending on how far you want to go back in history, there&#x27;s an argument that the intent of some previous Chinese devaluations were aimed primarily at increasing its relative attractiveness as an exporter.<p>Its most recent history until yesterday was to prop up the RMB, so it may be fair to argue that now is a strange time to label them a currency manipulator. Given yesterday&#x27;s  events and their history in this area though, it&#x27;s hard to make the claim that their currency policy is altogether ordinary either."
"This looks super cool. I got a bunch of questions!<p>1. Am I correct in understanding this is meant as a client-side only solution for now? Right now we have a pretty complicated translations process that needs to support translations that are spread across the client and server. Would this support a hybrid approach like that?<p>2. Another question I have is where does the `translations.json` file come from and where is that stored? Is that just generated by the CLI and then we have to deal with serving that however we want?<p>3. Is there one `translations.json` file per language? One with all of them? Are there performance concerns with sending large files like that over to the client? This is a general question for me to other developers of large sites: how do you deal with <i>tons</i> of translations?<p>4. Any plans to support existing translations? E.g. if I have an existing set of translations keys and values can I plug those in somewhere? I know y&#x27;all are bootstrapping so it wouldn&#x27;t surprise me if that&#x27;s a Future feature.<p>Again, love the idea of this, and it would be super cool if this solves the problems due to complexity we currently have with supporting a ton of languages.<p>--<p>For some background our current solution involves a generating a rather large (&gt; 1MB) `translations.json` file for each language that we serve to the client via a CDN. Typical map of keys to values.<p>We create the keys ourselves as we go along something like `dashboard.salesCard-helpText`. Then we have to kludgy Drupal instance to populate the key and value, add some tagging to show it needs to be translated. Translations get entered into that Drupal instance. All of this is entered manually. Then that gets used to generate the `translations.json` file I mentioned earlier.<p>We have plans in the future to overhaul the process."

I would guess there are at least a few Attorneys General who would take issue with this approach.<p>It&#x27;s not even close to the shadiest part of Yelp&#x27;s business but it&#x27;s one that at least some businesses could work together and push back on without running afoul of the binding arbitration&#x2F;class action prohibition in Yelp&#x27;s ToS.

SI Process: A thermochemical process that incorporates: (1) endothermic decomposition of hydrogen iodide (HI) at about 450°C in the presence of a carbon catalyst to yield hydrogen and I2, (2) recycle of the iodine to a concurrent or countercurrent column reactor where it reacts exothermically at about 120°C with sulfur dioxide (SO2) via the Bunsen reaction to form hydriodic acid (HI) and sulfuric acid (H2SO4), (3) gravimetric separation of the HI and H2SO4, and (4) thermal&#x2F;catalytic decomposition of sulfuric acid (H2SO4) to oxygen and SO2 at high temperature, up to 900°C, with the SO2 recycled back to the Bunsen reaction section. In the SI process, H2SO4 acts as oxygen carrier and HI as a hydrogen carrier.<p>2. HTSE Process: A ceramic electrolyte and electrode electrolysis process operating at up to 950°C. Water is the only reactant, and high temperatures allow for some of the energy required to split the steam (water) to be supplied as heat as opposed to electricity alone, as in LTE cells.<p>3. HyS Process: A hybrid process that produces hydrogen and oxygen in a polymer membrane based electrolysis cell operating at temperatures below 125°C. In the HyS process, SO2 is used to depolarize the cell and allow it to operate at lower voltages and hence higher efficiencies and current densities as compared to higher temperature electrolysis cells. Sulfuric acid is produced along with hydrogen in the cells, with the SO2 recycled from a sulfuric acid decomposer similar to that used in the SI process.&quot;"

We’re backed by a great group of investors including Y Combinator, Learn Capital, and Reach Capital.<p>We’re now moving on to all the other questions children have that they’ll never learn in school. In the last 18 months we received over 500,000 questions from children eager for better explanations of the world.  Now we’re creating video explanations for every question.<p>Our goal is to create a generation of better thinkers.

"I feel like people who are opposed to agile and scrum often make out things of it that are in no way prescribed by these methodologies. For example, I see people mentioning the idea that with scrum, you should release working software every sprint. This is not the case. The idea is to deliver a _potentially_ shippable product increment - a.k.a. not building 10 bridges in parallel if there&#x27;s no need for it. Some might even call this common sense.<p>Most people who are pessimistic about the agile development who I have spoken to are usually pessimistic because of poor implementations they&#x27;ve encountered. Any methodology is awful when misused or when hidden agendas are at play. No methodology will ever solve that.<p>That being said (probably onpopular opinion), I often also see engineers use agile to blame everything that is going wrong onto &quot;management&quot; and use it as way of avoiding responsibility. Complaining and arguing as if there are only absolutes is an immature and unproductive attitude. Calling agile &quot;nonsense&quot; is a prime example of that."
"This was well cited with a lot of fun media references. The author makes a few interesting points on rationale for randomization, calling known unknowns and confounding factors as something one could plan for and avoid.<p>Anybody know of other writers that do research and writing in this style?

"Tangentially related, but I wonder how long before HFT harnesses neutrino transmission to send market data directly through the earth? The MINOS [1] project is underway to send neutrinos from Fermilab in Illinois to detectors in northern Minnesota. Straight through the earth&#x27;s crust.<p>Detecting neutrinos is hard, and modulating data on them will probably be even more difficult, but if it shaves a few micro&#x2F;milliseconds off trading time, I&#x27;m sure someone will make it happen eventually. HFT have already added dedicated undersea fiber-optic links [can&#x27;t find source, NYC-&gt;LDN is obvious, I think there was talk or they began one from CHI&#x2F;NYC-&gt;TOK but might be wrong, it involved the melting icecaps to easily sink the fiber cable], shortwave radio broadcasts [3], and microwave links [4].

"Yelp 5 years ago was a truly valuable service.  You could go anywhere (in America) and find good food.<p>Then they lost focus.  The app has not improved an ounce since then (seriously why is &#x27;open now&#x27; not a default filter) and they&#x27;ve spent a lot of time doing shady things or complaining about other companies.  They&#x27;ve tried to get into reservations, delivery, and non-food services but with half-assed attempts at each.  They also did a really bad job at maintaining a healthy reviewer community (Google has done much better).<p>It&#x27;s a shame because I don&#x27;t think any other app took the lead here.  Yelp just walked backwards into the pack."

"Efficiency is also more important than it seems. You can have lots of low quality, half-baked output. How much forethought do we put into what we will work on to begin with? Some projects and ideas are not worth the effort. Or an alternative solution to a problem is preferable over one you’ve been hammering away at for days, and would be easier to implement.<p>And in the realm of programming, it’s often easy to take shortcuts even though later on they wind up costing more time for you or others involved: omitting documentation, not making something reproducible, poor code quality, etc.<p>Having spent most of my career in academia I see a lot of the work makes this trade off: efficiency is sacrificed for a sloppy, immediate “speedy” solution. You need to find a balance and think through problems, considering not only what is immediately in front of you but also what you’ll be doing in a month or year. Otherwise you’ll wind up with a project or codebase that begins to drag your productivity and output with it."
"Isn&#x27;t the author talking about recaptcha v2?

"The solution to killing off outrageously-priced hearing aids is to leverage the smartphone. It has everything that&#x27;s required to make an superlative hearing aid: excellent microphone, earphones, powerful CPU, and an all-day battery. A modern smartphone might not have a DSP but it has sufficient processing power to do the required audio processing. Many people who&#x27;d be embarrassed with visible hearing aids wouldn&#x27;t mind walking around with AirPods or other visible Bluetooth earbuds these days. The hurdle is that the hearing aid manufacturers will be complaining to regulators that you can&#x27;t sell a smartphone as a &quot;medical device&quot;.<p>The Apple AirPods with the &quot;live listen&quot; feature on iPhones (and iPads) is already being used by some people as a substitute hearing aid. You can use &quot;live listen&quot; with an actual hearing aid as well, but I&#x27;ve seen people using it with <i>just</i> AirPods and they seem to find it quite helpful.

"Don Reinertsen has been making this point and uses economical arguments to back it up: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=L6v6W7jkwok&amp;list=FL6P7ZzM6GT554-6xA_3lvjg&amp;index=3&amp;t=5s"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=L6v6W7jkwok&amp;list=FL6P7ZzM6GT...</a><p>I love this presentation because it adds strong economic arguments to a lot of practices that are quite common in software engineering but typically lack good argumentation as to why they are good. 
He covers a lot more ground in this presentation. Well worth your time if you are involved in any way in planning software development. I love his notions of option value and cost of delay. Cost of delay is exactly the economic argument why working quickly is important. Once you get it, is obvious that you should do agile, release early, and avoid embarking on long&#x2F;uncertain refactoring&#x2F;redesign efforts unless you can justify the payoff.<p>In short, any development that ships early maximizes the useful economic life on the market. If you ship something new earlier than your competitors, you get to charge a premium until they catch up. At some point your new thing becomes a commonality and the value drops. In some case, OSS just gobbles it up and the value becomes 0$.<p>So shipping 3 months earlier means you get to earn revenue for 3 months extra when it is still most lucrative. If you instead delay for 3 months because you are doing some thing that make things better in some way, you have to consider the cost of doing that AND the cost of missing out on that early revenue.<p>Don Reinertsen suggests you simply do the math consider the cost of delay when e.g. deciding on a big refactor vs. a lets get this to market ASAP type strategy. You don&#x27;t even have to do a particularly good job at doing the math to out-compete gut feelings here."
"Will it be possible to run a web browser on an SeL4 kernel some day, or is that completely beside the point?<p>Obviously, formally verifying a modern web browser with a javascript engine and everything is a whole other undertaking, so I&#x27;ll leave that aside.  But the notion of using a very secure kernel as the base OS is appealing.  Even if a hostile site broke out of the web browser, SeL4 should keep it sandboxed.  Presumably, SeL4 could enforce isolation between different browser tabs.  Is this something we can look forward to in the future, or are the performance expectations of modern javascript heavy web sites out of line with what SeL4 is likely to deliver?<p>Anyway, there are plenty of other applications beside the web, so glad to see that SeL4 is being used in real world deployments."
"&quot;You might notice that when h is very close to 0, the slope of the line very closely matches the graph of f(x)&quot;<p>Huh?<p>&quot;and therefore, the slope of the line very closely matches the growth rate of the function as well.&quot;<p>Growth rate?

"Excellent writing, I really enjoyed the content of the post and the way it’s written.<p>This phrase particularly stood out to me:<p>&gt; We are stronger by considering the opposite first.<p>That’s something I’m not very good at, but work hard to do. In many situations I have a tendency to assume I’m right, and that as soon as my interlocutor understands my argument, they will see I’m right. “I’m a rational person and I believe X, so if you don’t believe X you must be irrational.” So I spend lots of time clarifying my argument, and it gets nowhere.<p>By genuinely spending a larger proportion of my time thinking about others’ points of view, I arrive at better solutions."
The entire premise of the post-Bretton Woods neoliberal world US currency is based on an agreement with the Saudis to sell oil in US dollars for military support and on threats to bomb countries who sell oil in non-US denominations. And China is the currency manipulator.

"Very interesting article, my only real contention is on the point made in Mistake 4:<p>&gt; You can see it was a gamble by considering if Light had been outside Kanto; since he would not see it live, he would not have reacted, and all L would learn is that his suspect was in that other 2&#x2F;3 of the population, for a gain of only ~0.3 bits.<p>My understanding of L&#x27;s plan (based on what he said in the broadcast) was that he intended to do several live broadcasts, one in each region, until he was caught. Lind L. Taylor was a death row criminal being offered a deal to survive, and would&#x27;ve gone along with doing several broadcasts. Additionally, even if they didn&#x27;t do it live and simply recorded it there&#x27;s no way that Light would&#x27;ve known it wasn&#x27;t live and he would&#x27;ve acted in the same manner (and since Lind was in L&#x27;s custody, L would&#x27;ve known if he died even if Light didn&#x27;t).<p>At the time Death Note was written, mass internet communication wasn&#x27;t as prevalent and so you wouldn&#x27;t expect people to find out about events like the broadcast for at least a few hours (long enough to do broadcasts in each region). L probably hoped that Kira was in a less populated city since it would cut down on more bits of entropy (and I&#x27;d argue it would&#x27;ve been a better idea to start broadcasting to smaller cities first -- since it&#x27;s more likely an event like this in a big city would be quickly broadcast to the rest of Japan)."
"I&#x27;ve been wondering, how much processor overhead does UTF8 have? Not just because you can&#x27;t jump N bytes into a string to get a character offset, but because each byte has to be inspected to find whether it&#x27;s the start of a multi-byte segment, how many of the subsequent bytes 1-3 are included.<p>Does that mean there&#x27;s processor branch-prediction fails and stalling every few bytes in processing UTF8 strings with many multibyte characters in them?"

"I took my 4 year old to the ER because he had a 103 fever. The doctor put an ear thermometer to him and told me to give him some childrens ibuprofen. The visit lasted all of 5 minutes. The cost: $756.00.<p>I refused to pay it. It was the first time I did not pay a debt and the first time I was sent to collections. I refused based on principle, and not because I couldn’t afford it. Collections called me for about 3 months, and every time someone called and said, “is this John Wheeler”, I would never confirm and then go about asking why they are calling for John Wheeler. Eventually, the calls stopped and the collection agency wrote it off to their unpaid reserves (I’m assuming), I never received a ding on my credit report.<p>Everyone is always asking why US healthcare is so expensive.

"What would be the alternative to peer review? White papers on “pop” topics? Opinion pieces by think tanks?<p>The ideal of peer review is pretty much the gold standard of scientific work. By that, I mean the idea that your work should undergo rigorous scrutiny by your peers before it gets accepted for publications. As any other human system, though, the process is still subject to politics and biases.<p>My hope is that a truly open review system might one day democratize science and ameliorate the issues with the current review system. For example, it would be cool to put all the revisions, reviews and authors’ comments in the open as an online appendix. That will show how the paper changes as it moves trough the process, the issues that the reviewers brought up, and how the authors responded to them. It will also help show if there is systemic bias against certain researchers or topics."

"&gt; This ray tracer is developed from an example in Paul Graham&#x27;s book &quot;ANSI Common Lisp&quot;<p>I am currently reading that book, so I was immediately reminded of said book when I read the title.<p>Nice work making a microcontroller version of it :)<p>&gt; On an Adafruit ItsyBitsy M4 this scene containing five spheres and a plane takes approximately 230 seconds to render. It occupies about 1460 Lisp objects, and should also run nicely on an Arduino Due or ESP32.<p>&gt; [...]<p>&gt; The ray-traced image has a resolution of 160 x 128 pixels. To generate this we call tracer:<p><pre><code>  (defun tracer ()
    (dotimes (x 160)
      (dotimes (y 128)
        (plotpoint x y (apply rgb (colour-at (- x 80) (- 64 y)))))))
</code></pre>
&gt; This calls plotpoint to plot the pixel on the display device. For each pixel it calls colour-at to get the colour of the pixel:<p>How much time is spent updating all of the pixels compared to the time taken to do the mathematical calculations of ray tracing? I imagine that the calculations dominate the time taken by <i>a lot</i>.<p>Can a whole region of the display be updated faster than the amount of time it takes to set each pixel of the region individually?<p>What I was thinking of is that since it takes so much time before the whole scene is done rendering, perhaps it would feel like it took less time if the code was changed to render the whole thing in finer and finer chunks.<p>First set the whole display to the color of the coordinate at position (x, y) = (160, 128), then divide the display into four regions and update the three of the four subregions that said coordinate is not within, with the color of their local bottom right coordinates, and keep subdividing into fours and updating three of them like that, to quickly get a lower resolution sense of what the scene looks like as a whole.<p>It will take a bit more time in total, but if the calculations dominate by a lot, and if updating regions at a time is relatively fast then it may be perceived as being faster. Plus if you are working on a scene you can spot misplaced objects sooner without having to wait until everything “before” has finished rendering.<p>I think a lot of 3d renderers used to let you render in that way and perhaps some still do?"

"This could have been very ugly:<p><i>the 10-kg drone suffered an uncontrolled crash “in a wooded area of   Zurich’s university quarter only 50 yards away from a group of playing kindergarten children.”</i><p>One of the things that few people are aware about is quadrotor MTBF is very low relative to other common vehicles. For many drones, the expectation for failure dramatically increases just after 100-200 hours of operation[1]. Figuring out points of failures, building systematic fault trees and increasing MTBF by order of magnitude or two would be big part of the drone delivery projects.<p>[1] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;catsr.vse.gmu.edu&#x2F;SYST490&#x2F;490_2014_SPDAV&#x2F;DST-NSPDAV_USMA.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;catsr.vse.gmu.edu&#x2F;SYST490&#x2F;490_2014_SPDAV&#x2F;DST-NSPDAV_...</a>"

"I taught a similar course at Pilchuck in 2015, which was the first 3D-printing&#x2F;digital fabrication course taught there, and was also up there taking a flameworking course when Amos was TA&#x27;ing for Yoav and Angela.<p>First off, Pilchuck is amazing, and if you&#x27;re at all interested in glass, you should seriously consider taking a course there.<p>Second, modulo a few tricks for clean burnouts, if you can print it, you can investment-cast it in whatever material you want. It&#x27;s amazing how powerful cheap printers become when you combine them with a little casting skill - you can access nearly arbitrary geometry in some useful, high-performance materials without a $100k printer."

"I live in Berlin. Mobile networks are indeed a bad joke here. Most third world countries have much better networks. I always joke that I live about 1 km from the biggest FFing antenna in Germany (the TV tower, 350m tall, a major landmark and tourist destination) and yet cannot seem to get a reliable connection. I consistently get edge only near touristic areas because all of the base stations in those areas are apparently over provisioned. E.g. on the Alexander Platz right next to the before mentioned TV Tower I get edge only. That&#x27;s the very definition of an incompetent operator. There is no excuse for being allowed to get away with that poor level of service. They just don&#x27;t care here. In case you are wondering, the operator here is O2. I&#x27;d switch but doing so takes quite a lot of hassle (and paper work because Germany) and there is little evidence of other operators actually doing a much better job.<p>To fix this, the country needs lots of investments. E.g. they lack fiber optic cables in most of the country because the state monopolist pretending to be an actual company simply chose not to invest in this and the German government was completely OK with this for decades. This probably is part of the reason why 4G sucks here because there simply is nothing decent to connect the base stations to in most of the country. Fixing this will take ages and there are very little signs of this actually happening. E.g. most of Berlin has no access to fiber optic cable even though most of former East Berlin has gone through 25 years plus of heavy construction, renovation, etc. Apparently it never occurred to anyone here that stuffing some fiber optic cable in the ground would have been a clever idea. This is a key difference with e.g. the Netherlands where they&#x27;ve been putting cables in the ground for decades whenever there was any opportunity to do so. As a consequence, you can get fiber to your home in most places and reliably fast 4G in most of the country. This is the case across most of Europe with the exception of Germany.<p>The German government meanwhile is pretty hopeless. They have a &quot;digitization&quot; minister even. No idea what that means but it does not seem to yield more than weird photo opportunities for politicians without any apparent clue babbling about digitization (which is an actual word they keep on using with a straight face as if it means something). Also this minister is apparently not actually responsible for straightening out the dysfunctional mess that is the Deutsche Telekom, O2, and Vodafone kartel. That apparently is the responsibility for the traffic minister: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dw.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;germany-aims-for-faster-internet-digital-progress-with-new-digital-affairs-minister&#x2F;a-42872383"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dw.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;germany-aims-for-faster-internet-digit...</a>."

"<i>&gt; In Germany, for example, gigabyte connections—which handle more than 1,000 megabits per second—are rare.</i><p>Probably gigabit connections? More than 1000 megabits &#x2F; second requires hardware that is still rather uncommon in consumer grade routers and computers.<p><i>&gt; Telecom giants in France and Portugal were already rolling out all-fiber networks early in the decade, in keeping with a 2010 European Union report that recommended that national carriers invest in fiber.
How Fast 5G Mobile Internet Feels<p>But Deutsche Telekom, Germany’s dominant operator, took a less costly route in 2012, upgrading its existing copper network through a technology called vectoring.</i><p>Such kind of stupid short term greed driven decisions slow down progress by decades. I&#x27;ve seen somewhere, that Australia suffered a similar problem, where government decided that copper will be good enough, and halted deployment of fiber optics. And now it&#x27;s becoming a big problem."

"Aside: I work in med-tech. One of the largest complaints of doctors and nurses, especially in the ICU, is the cables and tubes. There are just SO MANY cables and tubes in a working ICU. Nurses and docs are constantly stepping on them, pulling them out, choking off blood&#x2F;saline&#x2F;urine&#x2F;air in some tube, knocking power off of another, etc. Most of the machines can&#x27;t do wireless, as some of the machines will &#x27;jam&#x27; that particular bandwidth to operate (MRI, etc).<p>As this article seems to be collecting a lot of great people that know their cabling, is there anything we can do to reduce or eliminate the headaches that are cables and tubes in a panicked ICU? Anything may help, and I&#x27;d love to know some more ideas.<p>EDIT: One thing I&#x27;ve found for cable bundle twisting issues is that &#x27;N-in-hand&#x27; braiding the cables helps relieve some of the stresses when they inevitably get twisted up. Think 30 wires&#x2F;tubes all twisting about as the patient&#x2F;machine is whirled about. Braiding the cables helps the wires on the outside of the bundle not twist and pull out as much as they are on the outside radius of the bundle. The braiding helps, in that over enough distance, all the wires spend equal &#x27;time&#x27; in the inside and the outside of the cable&#x27;s width.<p>Does anyone know of a good resource on cable&#x2F;tube twisting and how to help with it?"

"Author here. Thank you all for your comments, issues and pull requests. You are amazing!"
A counterintuitive thing I&#x27;ve discovered us that working fast let&#x27;s you solve more complex problems. At first it seems that you should try to go slow to make sure that all the cases are properly treated. Proceeding this way can result in nearly endless refinements as you go and losing sight of the main goals from time to time and repeatedly forgetting exactly where you are in the grand plan and which direction&#x2F;step you were headed.<p>Going fast doesn&#x27;t allow for secondary concerns and produces a single simple solution. Of course you can now do everything else it needs that you think of but code written this way with a clear core path is so refreshing from bottom-up generation where every detail has equal importance.<p>I even recall a time where I was performing a cascade of rebases and merges across three git branches and 4 or more submodule branches. Each feature update&#x2F;sync took so many tries to get right. I eventually got fed up and just brute-powered through it without prethinking it. Because it was a short time from start to finish I was able to clearly see each commit in each tree I was working on without a pause wondering where I was or doing next. It was also less error prone than going slow. It fact I just did the whole process twice in a fraction of the careful time and compared results. No diffs were taken as correct and any diffs were examined and the correct variant used.

"Hmm, given camera is on top, computing homography and rectifying the perspective image would give fairly good precision around the camera, falling off quickly with distance, likely not being very useful at the bottom of the screen. Also, it&#x27;s likely sensitive to both ambient light and the dominant light on the screen, in dark rooms with dark themes it might be pretty off, as most computer vision algorithms need constant tuning for changing conditions."
"This is pretty exciting but doesn&#x27;t look very efficient and the Strehl ratio is probably going to be as high as looking through a bottle of water. The cost of a 100-meter Overwhelmingly Large Telescope (OWL) proposed in the 90s is around $1.7B (the bid was lost to the ELT design.) Assuming adaptive optics is used, this instrument might achieve comparable level of resolution. To launch a mission like Terrascope, which with a 1-meter sized detector is equivalent to a 150-meter telescope, we are probably looking at expenses on the order of $10B - I&#x27;m looking at James Webb and Hubble. Imagine the spacecraft technology of exposing a 1-meter mosaic of CCDs in orbit and keeping it thermally controlled.<p>Although I am only an amateur astronomer, the biggest disadvantage I see is that the Terrascope won&#x27;t have the collecting area of a 150-meter telescope, as Earth is not transparent. We get the resolution of it, but we&#x27;re basically looking through a very large atmospheric ring with what - &gt;90% central obstruction? I cannot imagine the exposure times required to get anything meaningful and, also, the complexity of post-processing required to correct the ringing artifacts. Then, you&#x27;re limited to just 1 square degree of sky to observe - unless you maneuver the Terrascope detector in orbit, which is prohibitively expensive due to the limited fuel. Imagine the slew times measured in months... Finally, it&#x27;s going to have shorter mission design lifetime, if compared to a ground-based telescope. It can possibly be extended with a refueling mission, which would add to the cost, however. I think the overall value of this instrument is rather low, a curious proposition, but why?"
"Would like to see the original study for this, because it seems like something is getting lost in translation.  The article mentions 4 major prenatal steroid hormones involved, &quot;two known as androgens&quot;, but the headline says that estrogen is linked.  Colloquially, estrogen is the female sex hormone and androgens (including testosterone) are the male sex hormones.  Molecularly, &quot;estrogens&quot; are a family of different steroid hormones (not a single molecule), and androgens are a family of other hormones, and both of them occur in both males &amp; females but in different quantities.  And to muddy the waters further, many androgens are metabolic precursors of estrogens, eg. testosterone is synthesized into estradiol.  And to muddy them even further, some molecules (eg. DHEA) are both depending upon which biological receptors they bind to.<p>The title as written contradicts the article, using the colloquial meaning of the words involved.  There&#x27;s probably a more precise technical meaning where everything makes sense, but the article doesn&#x27;t really explain it."

"China have been manipulating their currency before this week&#x27;s drop. They use USD to buy CNY to prop up CNY exchange rate. If they stop buying CNY using USD, the value of CNY would fall (happening now). So China is technically no longer manipulating their currency.<p>Why are they doing this? My guess is to respond to trade war tariff. The US is manipulating USD through Fed interest rate. The Fed lowers interest rate to prop up borrowing and economic growth. I think China has figured out a way to deal with the situation. They will adjust the USD-CNY exchange to prop up their own economy.<p>This trade war is turning into a silly cat and mouse game. China is not making a deal. They have ways to get around tariff and TPP. War is about deception. The US needs some sneaky attack if it wants to win."

Also, as soon as I contact an agent about a listing their agents start spamming me with texts and emails written in a way that try to obscure that they are not the ones who have the listing.  At this point I never contact an agent through the Streeteasy platform.  I just google the agent&#x27;s name to find their contact info."

The current generation of 50+ years old developers came from a way smaller pool of developers when they all started 30+ years ago and that&#x27;s the reason that only a minuscule of them still codes. The percentage of current younger developers  still coding in their 50% will be more closer to other engineering fields based on amount of developers entering the field every year last 20 years (even considering how many will simply abandon doing development once hitting 30 or 40) - not everybody will become managers or start their own businesses.

If because someone used your property for offensive purposes, the water company cut off the water supply, or the electricity company refused to provide electricity, or your phone provider cut off service or what not. That would be ridiculous, yet it&#x27;s exactly the situation we&#x27;re in with internet services. No one wants to just be a utility.<p>I believe online service providers in at least some markets should be regulated like utilities.

Because at the moment, it seems any controversy at all means losing access to anything internet related."
"This mapping of wavelength to RGB value is very misleading: in particular, when moving to higher and higher frequencies, blue does not wrap around to red creating purple.  The perceptual color space that we are used to working in by mixing pigments or various frequencies of light is independent of light frequency.  Unlike all other colors in the rainbow, there is no single frequency that will activate both the red and blue cones within your eye to create purple; if you had a single frequency between blue and red, it would look green.  Instead, you must have two disjoint frequencies both stimulating the red and blue cones simultaneously (note that this is not strictly true, as for some people, the red cones do have some response down in the blue range, but the amount of red response within the blue region is extremely weak, and will not give the sensation of purple that is shown in articles such as this one).<p>This is why rainbows do not have purple at the edge, and why prisms do not create purple; it is a &quot;non-physical&quot; color (I made that term up, but it hopefully makes sense given my explanation above).<p>For a more physically-sound mapping of wavelength to color, see the CIE XYZ color system [1].  In particular, in Figure 2, the &quot;pure wavelengths&quot; are given as points along the outside edge of the curved surface, and as you can see, purple does not exist along that outside edge.<p>For those interested in simulation of color, I highly recommend Jiahao Chen&#x27;s old notebook &quot;The Colors of Chemistry&quot; [2], which goes through a lot of these concepts, and accurately simulates things like the color of solutions just from knowing their chemical composition.

"I agree that reCAPTCHA (all versions) are terrible. (At least, sometimes it is possible to avoid the problems by selecting the audio CAPTCHA, which tends to work better as far as I can tell.)<p>Instead, use the protocol-independent CAPTCHA. It is a SASL mechanism, which sends a challenge with plain ASCII text (and may include line breaks), and then accepts a single response of plain ASCII text, and then the server decides whether or not the response is acceptable. The similar thing can also be done with a simple HTML form, but using SASL would then allow working with any protocols and work with command-line interface just as well as HTML interface, too."

"Imo optional typing like this is the best trade-off for now.<p>Usually, statically typed languages is not expressive. There are a lot of abstractions are hard to express in statically typed languages. Even in Haskell. With optional typing, you can express usual ideas with types, and cheat with &#x27;any&#x27; when not applicable.<p>Another thing is the language itself can possibly execute without compile or even type check. Making developing feedback cycle much smoother when running tests or just save and refresh."

"This sounds dramatic and dire but I feel like the reason for the statistic is that by the 20 year mark in someone&#x27;s career, if they&#x27;re working for a big corporation, they&#x27;ve likely been promoted to management if they have any social skills at all.<p>Not because they can&#x27;t program anymore, but because corporations try to promote people to management if they&#x27;ve been around a while and haven&#x27;t screwed up, and they tend to pay them more if they accept."

"iTerm2 is incredible. I recently tried alacritty, though, and was amazed by how much faster it is with screen redraws on my 2014 Macbook Pro. I was shocked the first time I used mouse scrolling in vim through Alacritty and found that it was as snappy as in a native app; it never occurred to me that, even for a small pane, the bottleneck was in the emulator. I had to reimplement some of my favorite shortcuts for tab&#x2F;pane management in tmux, but overall everything is running <i>lightning</i> fast thanks to alacritty&#x27;s optimized, GPU-accelerated rendering. Alacritty also uses a dirt-simply YAML file for config (which I prefer to a GUI solution) and is cross-platform (which means I&#x27;ll be able to install this same setup, with tweaked shortcuts, on my Windows box next time I use it).<p>The new iTerm features sound really awesome, but the one thing I&#x27;m already missing badly is inline image-rendering via escape codes. I had a great workflow set up on for viewing astrophysical data products on a remote analysis server using the itermplot matplotlib backend to render plots directly in my terminal from ipython. I&#x27;m still planning on firing up iTerm2 for that use case.<p>All that said, iTerm2 is the best terminal emulator I&#x27;ve ever used, especially when you&#x27;re first learning things. I probably wouldn&#x27;t have been able to switch to tmux as easily if I hadn&#x27;t already used it a bunch through iTerm2&#x27;s beautiful tmux integration (I&#x27;d already configured some tmux functionality for that use case). The aforementioned image-rendering should be a universal feature for terminals. And though the input and redraw lag are higher than Alacritty or Terminal.app, it&#x27;s always been fast enough. I still recommend it to people with Macs who are just starting to program.<p>That said, if you&#x27;re a speed addict and want something with limited but easily-configurable features, give Alacritty a try!<p>[edit] I should also mention that, if you&#x27;re willing to put in more effort, you can implement a ton of iTerm2&#x27;s visual bonuses (like the status bar and pretty icons) with a combination of a Nerd font [0] (particularly a pretty modern one like Iosevka [1]) and an advanced tmux configuration [2].<p>[0] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ryanoasis&#x2F;nerd-fonts"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ryanoasis&#x2F;nerd-fonts</a><p>[1] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ryanoasis&#x2F;nerd-fonts&#x2F;tree&#x2F;master&#x2F;patched-fonts&#x2F;Iosevka"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ryanoasis&#x2F;nerd-fonts&#x2F;tree&#x2F;master&#x2F;patched-...</a><p>[2] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;samoshkin&#x2F;tmux-config"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;samoshkin&#x2F;tmux-config</a>"

This is one of the benefits of not having a linkedin profile. Recruiters&#x2F;former managers cannot see where you&#x27;re heading next.

"I find it really fascinating how small local decisions like how many square feet a store can be, influence what kind of companies form, and thus, how good your local breweries, cafes, bookstores, restaurants, groceries are.<p>Like they hint at in the article, I guess small store footprints make it not worth large &quot;faceless&quot; corporations opening shop and therefore the stores that do pop up are run out of more passion for the thing (some, at least).<p>Traveling in EU a bunch, I was always interested why in Italy, for example, small restaurants are on every residential block run by essentially mom and pops, and still surviving, serving up reasonably good food.

"I don&#x27;t know. I feel like there&#x27;s a pretty clear power law governing the skill-ceiling below which additional experience adds actual value to dev work. ~80% of programming labor (testing, basic REST services, static web content, managing a small-to-medium-size SQL database, etc.) has a very low skill-ceiling. I&#x27;ve been in the industry for 7 years, I now run my own show doing all of these things.  It&#x27;s just simple grunt work. Then there&#x27;s a very long tail of projects that require actual software engineering, where the skill ceiling is very, very high. Those latter positions exist all over the place, but you have to either create them or actively seek them out.<p>Conversely the skill-ceiling on managing technical projects is incredibly high. So although one certainly can efficiently stay on as an engineer, there is a much larger pool of opportunities in technical management, and they are much easier to find if you&#x27;re grinding away at a FANG &#x2F; enterprise company &#x2F; growing startup &#x2F; whatever.<p>If you want to do work that rewards many years of experience, it&#x27;s there. Management work is just much more likely to fall into your lap (which, let&#x27;s face it, is how the median employee finds anything).<p>For additional context, I also don&#x27;t really think &quot;programmer&quot; is a profession in a vacuum.

"Disclaimer: I won&#x27;t be able to find all my sources. I&#x27;m sorry for that.<p>I just looked into this 2 days ago! While I&#x27;m not the OP, this submission happens to be one of the most exciting articles I found (I should&#x27;ve submitted it :P). I was asking myself whether I should update my Fitbit Flex 2 to a Fitbit Versa or an Apple Watch or anything else really.<p>The answer is: don&#x27;t upgrade, keep the Fitbit Flex 2, it&#x27;s about as good as journalling your own sleep times and that&#x27;s all I need really, a very rough estimate. More importantly, the newer wearable devices are not good enough at giving a reliable breakdown of your sleep that polysomnography (the gold standard would give).<p>With that said: the Basic Health Tracker (doesn&#x27;t exist anymore, I think), Oura Ring, Philips Actiwatch Spectrum were all able to do things that trackers that the Fitbit and other wearables couldn&#x27;t.<p>Specifically:<p>&gt; Only mean values of sleep efficiency (time asleep&#x2F;time in bed) from Actiwatch correlated with PSG, yet this correlation was weak. [2]<p>&gt; Light sleep time differed from PSG (nREM1 + nREM2) for all devices. Measures of Deep sleep time did not differ from PSG (SWS + REM) for Basis. [2]<p>&gt; From EBE analysis, ŌURA ring had a 96% sensitivity to detect sleep, and agreement of 65%, 51%, and 61%, in detecting &quot;light sleep&quot; (N1), &quot;deep sleep&quot; (N2 + N3), and REM sleep, respectively. [4]<p>A good literature review on it is [3].<p>Some facts (which can be found in [3] or its cited papers):<p>* All trackers overestimate sleep by about 30 minutes.<p>* The biggest problem for all these wearable trackers are: estimating when you&#x27;re simply lying awake in bed but you&#x27;re not moving (it thinks you&#x27;re asleep).<p>* Devices like the Fitbit Flex are about as accurate as sleep journalling with regards to total sleep time.<p>Dreem has the following issues. It&#x27;s hard to see whether their scientific papers are peer-reviewed. Yes, they produce science articles in PDF formats but not in journals. Yes, they collaborate with universities but it isn&#x27;t clear how. Nothing is peer reviewed and almost nothing seems to be cited. This was echoed in a Gizmodo article [1], but I figured it out myself first.<p>I&#x27;m not saying they aren&#x27;t legit, because another thing I have noticed is that the scientific community is a bit but not too keen on testing these devices with the golden standard (polysomnography&#x2F;PSG). There is still space for a startup who is clearly capable of demonstrating this and other research institutes confirming it independently for their device.<p>Edit: I hope I gave enough sources to make my comment a bit credible.<p>[1] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gizmodo.com&#x2F;this-smart-headband-was-supposed-to-help-me-sleep-bette-1822568894"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gizmodo.com&#x2F;this-smart-headband-was-supposed-to-help...</a><p>[2] obtained from abstract @ <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pubmed&#x2F;27164110"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pubmed&#x2F;27164110</a><p>[3] obtained from abstract @ <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ieeexplore.ieee.org&#x2F;stamp&#x2F;stamp.jsp?arnumber=8648428"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ieeexplore.ieee.org&#x2F;stamp&#x2F;stamp.jsp?arnumber=8648428</a><p>[4] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pubmed&#x2F;28323455"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pubmed&#x2F;28323455</a>"
"It seems like it&#x27;s doing well because things are bad in silicon valley, not in spite of.
It sounds like there are a lot of desperate startups getting loans to &#x27;simulate&#x27; growth by having negative profit margins (since they can&#x27;t get real growth otherwise), then they use that fake growth to get investors&#x27; money which they use to service debt, then they keep raising money until they exit or IPO.
It doesn&#x27;t seem sustainable. All these debts end up the hands of corporate shareholders. There&#x27;s a point where companies and the public will stop buying useless startups (if that point hasn&#x27;t already passed)."
My favorite part is the anti-NIMBY culture that usually dominates here is experiencing cognitive dissonance right now and they don&#x27;t even know it.<p>Bring up housing in SF and the people complaining about no trees right now are suddenly shuffling everyone into tiny uniform boxes.
"I disagree with several claims from this article.<p>&quot;Meyer suspects one of the factors leading to this divide can be found in the numbers: according to her book, there are 500,000 words in the English language, but only 70,000 in French. This means that Anglophones are more likely to have the exact word to say what they want, whereas Francophones must often string together a series of words to communicate their message.&quot;<p>If true (I suspect a methodology shenanigan there) I really doubt this is a factor. Very few French or English speaker will have a mastery of 70,000 words, to say nothing of 500,000.<p>According to one source [1] adult English speakers are typically in the 30 000 - 50 000 range.

However, France, like Russia and Japan, tends to be a high-context culture, where “good communication is sophisticated, nuanced and layered.&quot;<p>I (and many of my French expat friends) have the opposite experience with US: shallow enthusiasm, shallow friendships, fake excitement. Feels like Americans present a simple layer that is actually a mask, whereas French actually show their inner feelings more easily (which ends up being a bit messy, like I suspect everyone is).<p>I was told several time (and experienced) that Americans love to say yes, and not follow through, which is a pretty rude thing in France. &quot;Why don&#x27;t we have lunch one day?&quot; &quot;you should come to my house!&quot; &quot;Let&#x27;s make something together&quot; Apparently these are non-committal statement in US. In France they are. That&#x27;s why being able to say no is far more important.<p>Etymologically, &quot;French&quot; comes from &quot;Franks&quot; the name of the germanic&#x2F;celtic tribe that lived there. It also gave the word &quot;frankness&quot;. I never thought much of it but after working with several foreign colleagues, I really think there is a reason why this tribe and this trait got mixed together.<p>In France we value frankness and we don&#x27;t find it commendable to hide your feelings or your opinions. If you promise something you have to follow through. You are going to receive a lot of &quot;non&quot; because of that, because &quot;oui&quot; really means &quot;oui&quot;."

Then if you are in cloud land, have a second network adaptor on a different subnet. If you are running real steel, then you can use a bonded network adaptor with multiple VLANs on the same interface. (The need for a VLAN in a VPC isn&#x27;t that critical because there are other tools to impose network segregation.)<p>Then use macvtap, or macvlan(or which ever thing that gives each container a macaddress) to give each container its own IP. This means that your container is visible on that entire subnet, either inside the host or without.<p>There is no need to faff with routing, it comes for free with your VPC&#x2F;network or similar. Each container automatically has a hostname, IP, route. It will also be fast. As a bonus it call cane be created at the start using cloudformation or TF.<p>You can have multiple adaptors on a host, so you can separate different classes of container.<p>Look, the more networking that you can offload to the actual network the better.<p>If you are ever re-creating DHCP&#x2F;routing&#x2F;DNS in your project, you need to take a step back and think hard about how you got there.<p>70% of the networking modes in k8s are batshit insane. a large amount are basically attempts at vendor lock in, or worse someone&#x27;s experiment thats got out of hand.

"The part that I concerned with has to do with discoverability.  If you push these people underground they will not disappear.  That has never happened in the history of humanity.<p>I would much rather the exist in plain view, free to voice their hatred in plain view.  I would much rather the algorithms and people of sound mind monitor these individuals and groups in broad daylight than have them exist behind encrypted radicalization chat rooms.<p>If the standard is to shutdown services that can lead to radicalization and, therefore, harm or death, then the government should shut down Facebook, Twitter, Google and maybe more.<p>Why treat this any differently that 737 MAX crashes?<p>The only reason I can see not to do this is to be able to keep an eye on people who self-radicalize.<p>Sadly I have an example of this in my own family.  We have an older relative (late 70’s) who, up until about two years ago, did not own a computer or use the Internet.<p>He was given a computer by a family member so he could use FB to keep in touch with family in the US and abroad.<p>We have been watching, in absolute horror, as he has been going down a path towards ever increasing hatred.  No, not what you think.  I won’t go into details other than to say that he had his political leanings a couple of years ago and FB turned them into nothing less than hatred, constant unrelenting hatred.<p>No, he isn’t going to go hurt anyone.  He is hurting himself.  He is in a solid gradient descent into a sad existence and likely already very much in the grips if depression.<p>I know it’s FB because that’s all he does with the computer.  He is, otherwise, computer illiterate.  He doesn’t have much if an education, which makes the constant stream of hateful memes, posts and articles impossible for him to filter.  He is, effectively, mostly incapable of critical thinking now that he has been pulled down into this dark cave.<p>Precisely because this is happening in plain sight, various members of our family, myself included, have been engaging with him to try and pull him out of Plato’s proverbial cave.<p>This task is incredibly difficult.  FB feeds him a constant stream of similar material and the world of reason evaporates behind a cloud of hatred.  All he sees are shadows on the wall.<p>We need this in the open in order to be able to help those we love as well as others.<p>We also need FB and others to understand how much harm their algorithms seem to be causing."

There&#x27;s also an Arduino-like board that costs more than the latest Raspberry Pi 4.<p>In the meanwhile I can buy a $100 quad core ARM board with a CUDA capable GPU onboard and 4GB of RAM. Proprietary? Sure. But it&#x27;s 1&#x2F;10th the price, several times faster, and it&#x27;s available in any quantity right now.<p>Real artists ship, not just go to conferences and discuss how glorious their ISA is going to be in 10 years when they get around to actually getting something out the door."

"What an excellent, level headed article.<p>I wish it&#x27;d be emphasized a little more - as a software dev, you&#x27;ll likely either end up having to move laterally to a new skill set that isn&#x27;t entirely related to your previous experience (moving from C++ to Ruby on Rails and web dev as the example in the article) or move &#x27;up&#x27; to management or architect positions.<p>Both of those are difficult and fairly unique to software development. Most jobs don&#x27;t require these types of shifts. A number of jobs do simply wear your body out and leave you in difficulty in your 40s however, and that requires a complete career shift or that move &#x27;up&#x27; to management, both of which are non-trivial paths to take."

Many years ago I wrote navigation software for ocean going vessels&#x2F;ships. We used double and triple redundancy on many of our sensor types. We generally used three control computers that would &#x27;vote&#x27; before deciding to make vessel navigation changes. We also always included a &quot;Dead man&#x27;s switch&quot; that allowed the bridge crew to take control at any time.<p>I can&#x27;t even imagine designing aerial vehicle autopilot without redundency. The stakes are too high...<p>I would be interested in having a look at the statistical model they used to prove &#x27;the system was reliable with zero-redundancy&#x27;. While designing these systems for ships the only way we were able to get an error probability near zero was when we used triple redundancy.

I really hope he can finish all of the volumes of his books, it will truly be a gift to humanity."

"I once met a guy who was a programmer for a hedge fund. The strategies and knowledge he had would be very useful to competitors.

I guess the strategies these guys use only have a limited shelf life but I don&#x27;t really know much about this sort of work.<p>Perhaps that sounds like overkill but it feels a bit more reasonable and more fair to the employee - if you want someone to agree to a non-compete then you should agree to pay them for their time where they can&#x27;t work."

"Most big cities have a majority of the population without cars at this point. These cities naturally favor more legislation against cars and this is causing city administrators to over time introduce more restrictions for cars. E.g. many Dutch cities got a head start on this to make more room for bicyclists in the nineteen seventies already. Simple measures include raising prices for parking and parking permits, introducing park and ride areas where people can park and hop on a bus to the downtown area, making lots of streets one way only and segmenting off different parts of the city such that you can only drive there via the ring road, making large parts of the down town area car free, etc. Cars are for getting in and out of the city not for driving from A to B inside a city.<p>I live in Berlin which is comparatively car friendly because of the German car manufacturing lobby. You can drive to the downtown area and expect to find street parking. This is very un-european at this point. Forget about doing that in Amsterdam, Paris, London, Madrid, etc. Not a thing there anymore. Even a few decades ago that would have been a bad idea. You&#x27;d be stuck in traffic for ages and your only option for parking will be a full (probably) parking garages charging massive fees. These days it&#x27;s flat out not allowed or at least enormously expensive.<p>Even so, owning a car does not make much sense in Berlin and most tech people with comparatively decent incomes I know here in the massive startup scene don&#x27;t own cars and many of the few that do rarely use them."

"The problem is, when everybody thinks like this, it stays like this. With rising age People tend to change into people jobs if they can because somehow the air gets thinner as there are not that many advanced software jobs - although there certainly are a lot and even more places that do appreciate advanced abilities. On the other hand a lot of skills&#x2F;experiences are transferable. E.g. some weird DB connection keep alive bug might be analogue to debug on C++, node.js and Rust. Developers with not enough experience might give up, change DBMS, refactor the whole DB layer (hoping it&#x27;s MVC&#x27;ish) or even give up on the project if it&#x27;s not an important one.<p>Also most new tech builds on the learnings of the old tech and discards outdated patterns that were possible with the existing stacks, but advanced users might have stopped using those anyways. For example Java has no multiple (class) inheritance in contrast to the much older C++."

"So, really, is there any doubt that this is true?

They just found it politically unpalatable to admit it out loud.<p>The real question would be, why is the U.S. finally admitting this out loud?
1) amping up a trade war
2) decoupling U.S. economy from China
3) trying to leverage China into doing something differently, perhaps regarding North Korea<p>Some of these, of course, would interfere with others, for example you can&#x27;t use it as leverage in #3 if China thinks you&#x27;ll keep pursuing it anyway no matter what, due to #1 or #2."

"A common failing of these &quot;for the people&quot; guides is that they fail the most basic UX test: User observation.<p>When you build a UI, at some point you have to test it on actual people, observing them as they try to use it. Without fail, you&#x27;ll discover a whole bunch of assumptions you&#x27;d made without even realizing it. It&#x27;s only natural, since you&#x27;ve been working on this project for months and have intimate understanding that you&#x27;ve gained during your time of designs and rewrites and refactorings. But your user doesn&#x27;t have that history, and you can&#x27;t remember where common knowledge ends and your assumptions begin anymore. So you do observation tests to expose as many of these as you can.<p>If you want to make a &quot;for the people&quot; instructional site, it&#x27;s imperative that you offer an easy feedback mechanism so that people can instantly tell you when something confuses them. Simply relying on success stories exposes you to survivorship bias. Understanding is a two-way street. Design your medium with that in mind, and do LOTS of iterations with real people."

"Let me start by stating my views on free speech and rights in general, and then how they are shaped by these events.<p>I think that human rights and freedoms are just that: personal freedoms. Freedom of religion is about personal religious observance without harming others. These freedoms philosophically should not mean entitlement to unlimited exercise thereof.
The right to bear arms doesn’t mean you should be able able to stockpile unlimited amounts of ammunition and incendiary devices etc.<p>Similarly, FREEDOM of speech to me is a PERSONAL human freedom. You can say what you want, and not be punished by the government for it. You can say it in a car, you can say it in a bar, you can say it very far, you can wish upon a star. But there are limits to how many people can hear you. Maybe 10 or 100 people at an event.<p>Once you get into situations where 5,000,000 people can hear a tweet, that’s clearly not about FREEDOM of speech in its strict sense. It is about entitlement to use a PLATFORM, maintained by an ORGANIZATION that involves many people, to broadcast arbitrary, unfiltered one-to-many messages to everyone.<p>I think this latter thing is toxic, in both directions. Society listening to tweets of celebrities cheapens public discussion and civic thought. And being reachable by the whole world using email (rather than through networks of shared invited&#x2F;capabilities) leads to constant spam and papparazzi for celebrities. What happened here is an ORGANIZATION put on a show or movie and catapulted this celebrity into the limelight and carefully maintains their stature, along with their own publicists, social media team on twitter, etc.<p>This is the society we live in, where we have heroes. But entitlement to unlimited unfiltered megaphones is NOT the same as freedom of speech, any more than being a leader if a paramilitary group of unlimited size is the same as the right to bear arms.<p>So, freedoms and rights have limits. Where those limits lie is the heap paradox - as you take away grains, when is a heap no longer a heap? etc.<p>So what is the alternative to this type of misnamed “free speech” aka megaphones run by organizations, super PACs, mainstream media, and so on? It is COLLABORATION.<p><pre><code>  Look at Wikipedia.
  Look at peer reviewed journals and science.
  Look at large open source projects
</code></pre>
There, individual contributions are filtered and often butt up against changes, revisions, etc. The result is that when the general public sees something, it is the result of a collaborative process of filtering and refining the presentation of information, citing sources, etc. There are no heroes on wikipedia, and only a few in science and open source. Most contributions are filtered by a community of experts, not state governments or platforms employing boiler rooms of low paid workers to determine what’s true.<p>I would like to see more of that COLLABORATION and less of COMPETITION. I would like to see a patentleft movement in drug research, instead of big pharma. I would like to see news reported like Wikipedia with footage submitted by everyday people on the ground instead of “intrepid reporters in a warzone”. CNN used to have a motto that they have “no celebrities”. News agencies tried to stay lukewarm and neutral. FOX News changed the game, lots of people copied the model. The Internet eliminated newspapers and classifieds. News had to adapt because capitalism and cutthroat competition for the same ad dollars means MORE clickbait and MORE lockin to one type of audience. For-profit Social networks further use this content to herd us into echo chambers of outrage, because that’s what drives the most <i>engagement</i>, which the social networks need to monetize. They send notifications in an increasingly desperate attempt to grab your attention in a tragedy of the commons where the commons is our attention.<p>This has had a corrosive effect on society. The capitalist (competition based) news has made us more polarized and outraged, while the capitalist (competition based) social networks have made us more addicted to our notification slot machine, with smaller attention spans and self control, responding to that stranger on the internet over that latest outrage.<p>THIS is the culture that leads to more mass shootings. The fact that we have giant platforms instead of peer to peer is another problem. By banning extremist people from platforms, a platform can pop up which attracts the worst extremists, and feeds them. This platform should ABSOLUTELY be a honeypot for the FBI to watch these people. In our world of centralized platforms, Platforms like this should be RUN by the FBI.<p>Instead, our government takes the wrong approach. They shut down the Craigslist and Backpage hookers sections instead of using them to entrap and catch traffickers. Then they threaten large platforms with SESTA (2018) when they should be the ones catching the people who are out there. The platforms should be honeypots!<p>Anyway. So although I feel my stance is correct, and beneficial to society, there are three practical problems with it:<p>1. First Amendment is not interpreted as I do. In fact Citizens United even allowed our politics to be run by PACs with huge money and megaphones (although nonprofits could have always done that). So legally my literal understanding of limits of freedoms is not matching the traditional ones (slander, yelling fire etc.)<p>2. This may be the more serious one. As we have more end to end encryption and better personal technology, all well-meaning ideas about limits of freedom of speech and arms melt away. Imagine Alex Jones on SAFE Network with 1,000,000 people subscribed to his encrypted feed. Or imagine 3d printed guns from illegally shared 3d models, stored in 10% of the homes in NYC. Can’t stop people using a turing complete language to turn out banned material.<p>3. Even with numerical limits on each person’s audience, a hateful message can attract people who make plans to use technology to asymetrically perpetrate criminal acts. And end-to-end encryption means we won’t know what they’re saying.<p>However, I believe that if we took the freedoms in the way I defined them, and moved to collaborative platforms instead of competitive ones, our society’s health would <i>measurably</i> improve."

"Roblox, Fortnite, Minecraft are the new social networks right? Well when I was 15 and we used to play Counter Strike and Quake 3 the &quot;social network&quot; was hanging out on servers with maps just chatting and walking around the map aimlessly or just hanging out on IRC.
So I can totally relate to how kids nowadays are going back to this sorta hangout. Text only can be boring (kinda like IRC for many people who couldn&#x27;t tolerate it) but hanging out in servers, spinning around and doing stuff actively (albeit not productively for society) is actually much more fun. Now couple this with discord and all the in-game voice chat stuff + emotes and the ability to build anything. Yeah I can totally see why young kids wanna hang out in video games all day!"

"Age discrimination is absolutely a thing, but (and this is <i>only</i> based on anecdata) I would say it is much, much worse in the valley than just about anywhere else. The rest of the world seems to have a less damaged culture."
"I genuinely fail to understand the advantages of any sort of Lisp. Contrary to what gigantic brain lisp devs might think, it&#x27;s syntactical annoyingness is far too much of a barrier to overcome."
"This has been going around Facebook for a couple days now. It takes me back! I was an &quot;artist&quot;† in one of the better-known second-tier groups (if ICE and ACID comprise the first tier) and ran a fairly popular, though relatively small-scale, BBS in Chicago.<p>It&#x27;s a good video and worth watching, but (I think) gets some things wrong that kept snapping me out of it.<p>For one thing, the link between HPAV boards (&quot;HPAC&quot; was not a common term) and warez boards is way overblown. The major groups all probably did have a couple of H&#x2F;P people attached in some way, but for the most part I think all that amounted to was setting up conference bridges, which was super easy to do. The bit about &quot;dummy 1-800 numbers&quot; --- and someone could tell me that did really happen in a bunch of places --- rings false, because at the time, 800 numbers were perceived as risky, due to ANI. I got in trouble for phone bills like everyone else, but really, unless you were actually downloading warez, dialing into random BBS&#x27;s across North America wasn&#x27;t <i>that</i> expensive.<p>Warez boards and H&#x2F;P boards were very different subcultures.<p>(For that matter: many boards <i>were</i> linked together through the FIDO protocols, which was like the BBS equivalent of Usenet).<p>I also don&#x27;t remember much of a crossover between the ANSI scene and the demoscene (they were both linked through the broader BBS scene, of course). I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the case that ANSI people fed into demo stuff.<p>There are technical details in here I think are wrong as well. Most notably, I don&#x27;t think it was modem speeds that broke ANSI, but rather modern operating systems. We didn&#x27;t use ANSI because it was space efficient so much as because the only way to access a BBS was through a terminal emulator, and, for a long time, that meant MS-DOS. Also: the amount of technical skill you needed to do this stuff is way overblown. MS-DOS is cryptic compared to macOS and Win10, but it&#x27;s how <i>everything</i> got done in the late 1980s and early 1990s; your parents often knew as much as you did about getting around on MS-DOS. Once people started SLIP&#x27;ing into ISPs on Windows and OS&#x2F;2, it was just as easy to get GIFs as it was to get ANSI art.<p>It&#x27;s hard to blame the video for that; my understanding is that it started out as a school final project, and, at any rate, it&#x27;s trying to communicate to a lay audience.<p>Finally: I&#x27;m sort of spitting my drink out at the assertion that ANSI artists were exploring undiscovered new modes of visual expression, or that ANSI shading techniques are comparable to major artistic movements. If you want to say that about any countercultural art form, you&#x27;d say it about real graffiti, from which ANSI derived a lot of its visual style. The artistic-technical work involved in graffiti is, I think, a lot more serious than ANSI was. Looking back at old ANSI packs, a lot of it is just the technical-technical work of transcribing a reference image from a comic book or album cover into a pixel editor. That, by the way, didn&#x27;t take weeks or months; once you got the hang of it, it was pretty quick (and by the early 1990s, a lot of that artwork was being drawn specifically for and with high-res viewers, so literally you were just using TheDraw as a sort of zoomed-in pixel editor).<p>I think pixel artists today work with much more significant constraints, do more interesting work, and probably don&#x27;t draw a whole lot on the 1990s ANSI scene.<p>Eagerly awaiting my comeuppance from an ICE or ACID person on this critique. :)<p>† <i>not a good one</i>"
"I wonder if Scott Hanselman ever had to maintain large system while having limited resources to do so. Churn is bad for most, apart from companies who must sell new things to keep on going, like software companies. Moving fast and breaking things is great when you don&#x27;t have to consider churn cost. Calling the anti-churn crowd &quot;dark matter developers&quot; seems at least a bit derogatory."
"Of course the Japanese had this concept figured out.<p>I do this thing with a small group of friends, where we drive like 3-4 grands worth of speakers and room correction DSP (Genelec and DSpeaker) to a summer cottage every 6-8 weeks or so. The place, a big log cabin, happens to have wonderful acoustics.<p>And we just sit back, mostly STFU and listen to a selection of music for an entire evening, DJ:ed by me (I accept requests), and we eat good food. There&#x27;s no background music, when we cook, eat or clean, because we want to rest our ears for the main sessions.<p>The next day, we drive back, I check everything we listened to from Last.fm, and I create a Spotify playlist of the event, which we all save.<p>Most people look at me like I’m insane when I describe this activity."

"Both of my kids played a lot of Roblox until we banned it. They easily became obsessed and were violent when removed, even with a tightly controlled schedule. They would try to connect to offer WiFi networks to get access and would steal our phones to get access. We ended up having to detox them like it was a drug.<p>Beyond that we found that the openly mod-able nature of the game allowed some remarkably disgusting 3D models and game modes.  Just Google it.  It was not hard to find a room with 50 kids holding adult store items and doing extremely inappropriate things.<p>The system is also rife with predators. One game let them share pictures somehow.  Some guy was asking my daughters to send them pictures of their feet.  Try to censor that request in chat, I guess.<p>This if course sets aside the caste system that is built on their in-game currency. Scammers can convince your kids to trade their favorite items away in a &quot;trust trade&quot;.<p>Roblox is not appropriate in my experience."

Similarly with leaking financial information, anyone capable &amp; willing to defraud people based on this information has much better ways of generating ROI than hoping on the one snippet of information in a million that could lead to a breach.<p>It&#x27;s similar to that time it was revealed a bunch of iOS apps were screen recording users using the app. Having worked at companies that collected that data, the <i>only</i> conceivable use we had for it was to help diagnose bugs for individual users having issues with the app. Every other question we wanted answered, it was much easier to use aggregated data collated specifically for that purpose. A bunch of videos of people tapping the screen was less than useless for that. And yet when I told people about that, in general, they refused to believe me and believed there must be some super secret nefarious reason we were collecting such &quot;invasive&quot; information."

"Last year I was contacted on Linkedin by a headhunter at AWS for an opportunity in Ireland as a senior lead dev. At this time I was working hard toward a different destination, so it didn&#x27;t exactly match my plans, but the &quot;wow&quot; effect of an opportunity in Amazon made me accept to &quot;have a chat&quot; with him, because I thought it was worth seeing if on the long term they could help me to reach my destination.<p>After I accepted, the recruiter asked me a CV. I gave it to him even thought my LinkedIn profile is far more detailed and qualitative than any CV. Then I received an email for a technical automated test, which was ridiculously easy.
Two weeks later, when I received an automatic email saying that I reached the first &quot;candidate interview&quot; step, I politely declined and explained why.<p>Copy&#x2F;pasting my CV in a standard recruitment process and being handled like I had applied for the job by myself is not my definition of &quot;having a chat&quot; not of headhunting...<p>I already wasted the 4 first years of my career in a political and corporate &quot;big company&quot;, thank you very much.

"This is a great rundown. I started my career at Microsoft working with and on Win32&#x2F;COM and saw this play out first hand.<p>One thing not mentioned here is the history of the &quot;Byte Order Mark&quot; (BOM) in unicode.<p>(Not an expert here but my understanding having lived it.)<p>You see, given UCS-2, there are 2 ways to encode any codepoint -- either big endian or little endian. The idea was then to create a codepoint (U+FEFF) that you could put at the start of a text stream that would signify what order the file was encoded in.<p>Wikipedia page: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Byte_order_mark"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Byte_order_mark</a><p>This then got overloaded.  When loading a legacy text format often times there is the difficulty of figuring out the code page to use.  When applied to HTML, there are a bunch of ways to do it and they don&#x27;t always work.  There are things like charset meta tags (but you have to parse enough HTML to find it and then re-start the decode&#x2F;parse).  But often times even that was wrong.  Browsers used to (and still do?) have an &quot;autodetect&quot; mode where it would try divine the codepage based on content. This is all in the name of &quot;be liberal in what you expect&quot;.<p>Enter UTF-8.  How can you tell if a doc is US ASCII or UTF-8 if there are no other indications in the content? How does this apply to regular old text files? Well, the answer is to use the BOM. Encode it in UTF-8 and put it at the start of the text file.<p>But often times people want to treat simple UTF-8 as ASCII and you end up with a high value codepoint in what would otherwise be an ASCII document.  And everyone curses it.<p>Having the BOM littered everywhere doesn&#x27;t seem to be as much of a problem not as it used to be.  I think a lot of programs stopped putting it in and a lot of other programs talk UTF-8 and deal with it silently.  Still something to be aware of though."

"Very nice! A key attraction of pure Prolog code is indeed that it can be evaluated in different ways to obtain better termination and performance characteristics, and to derive more semantic consequences of programs. The equation &quot;Algorithm = Logic + Control&quot; indicates this ability to provide and use different ways of control to evaluate the logical meaning of Prolog code.<p>These slides seem to focus primarily, and in fact exclusively, on an important control mechanism called SLDNF resolution (SLD resolution with negation as failure):<p><a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;SLD_resolution"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;SLD_resolution</a><p>This is the standard execution method of Prolog.<p>There are other ways to execute Prolog code too though, notably SLG resolution. SLG resolution is also called <i>tabling</i>, and it is provided by an increasing number of Prolog implementations and also in different variations. SLG resolution is a control strategy that terminates in many cases where SLDNF resolution does not terminate.<p>For example, the Prolog predicate<p><pre><code>    a :- a.
</code></pre>
<i>terminates</i> (and fails) with SLG resolution, but not with SLDNF resolution.<p>Note that Prolog is restricted to <i>least Herbrand models</i>. This is different from answer set programming (ASP), where you get all models. For example, the above program has two models in ASP (and in logic) namely one where <i>a</i> is true and one where <i>a</i> is false, but only one least Herbrand model (where <i>a</i> is false).<p>A common criticism of Prolog is that is &quot;confined to depth first search&quot;, but that is not the case: You can reason about Prolog code in many different ways, and also execute it with iterative deepening, for example. This is in fact a major attraction of Prolog, not available in most other programming languages.<p>However, the more impure constructs you use, the more this flexibility shrinks. The ability to use different control mechanisms is a strong argument to use, as far as possible, the pure monotonic core of Prolog."

"I think that a solution this problem as well as many others like undo influence, too much money needed and so on, could be solved by increasing the number of representatives.  I believe that the only stipulations in the constitution is that each state must have at least one and that a representative cannot represent less than 30K citizens. The number was frozen 35 in 1911 by the house, but they could change that if they wanted to without changing the constitution.<p>The reason I think this would help on a number of levels is as follows 1) Gerrymandering becomes more difficult if there are a lot more districts. 2) influence peddling and lobbying is diluted if there are more representatives. 3) the voter can have more influence and contact with their representative if their congress person represents a smaller sized constituency.<p>I think arguments around the size of the building (the capital) are silly, who cares where they meet, it can be in a stadium, or even better why bother having them all in Washington DC. it can all be done with telepresence in todays world and then you as a citizen could go down to say the court house and sit in the audience as your representatives interact via telepresence.<p>I get it that perhaps all this seems crazy or whatever, but none of it would require any changes to the constitution. It could be done by the House itself with no consent from the Senate or President."

"I&#x27;ve noticed something sneaky about Facebook on my phone. I refuse to install their apps but I do use Facebook a bit so I use it via the phone Browser (in my case, Chrome on Android).<p>I&#x27;ve noticed that sometimes Facebook shows a fake &#x27;youve got a message&#x27; icon to try and trick you into installing their messenger app.<p>To re-produce this behaviour: (this works best if you dont get a lot of facebook messages. Also you need a phone with no facebook apps installed)<p>- On your desktop PC, use facebook to send a message to someone<p>- Then switch to your phone, using facebook in the browser<p>- After about an hour, the little speechbubble message icon at the top will go red, showing you&#x27;ve got a message<p>- If you click on this from a phone browser, it redirects you to install messenger. (normally, phone-browser facebook doesnt do messenger features)<p>- Instead of that, switch on &#x27;request desktop site&#x27; (not sure what iOS calls this option) to make your phone display the desktop version of facebook. And then you can (usually) read your messages in the browser<p>- But you will find that there is no new message, and the new message icon will no longer be lit up.<p>I&#x27;ve had this happen five or six times now - supposedly new messages have arrived but when you look there are none. It always happens about an hour after sending a message. I&#x27;m pretty convinced its deliberate behaviour on the phone browser version of facebook to get you to install their messenger app."
"I don&#x27;t think name as domain is important anymore since it&#x27;s pretty much a numbers game - it is unlikely you&#x27;ll get your name as a .com domain(the only domain that matters if you want more than a toy website) is going to either be squatted on or already occupied.<p>There needs to be some sort of TLD with authentication.

"I&#x27;ve been using Unison since... forever.<p>A hint regarding running the latest Mac binary on Mojave: if the GUI crashes on you, it&#x27;s likely to be an issue regarding syncing file _permissions_ and not just files.<p>This has been biting me for a couple of months now whenever I sync my development tree between Dropbox and OneDrive, since Windows&#x27; WSL tends to set wonky 0x777 permissions on entire file trees, and it is usually those that cause Unison to crash.<p>Otherwise, I&#x27;ve been using it to sync 400K+ files without incident."

"&gt; When you stop to consider all the implications of poor performance, it’s hard not to come to the conclusion that poor performance is an ethical issue.<p>I don&#x27;t think its clear cut and the article does not make a good argument that &quot;poor performance is an ethical issue&quot;<p>The two supporting points are roughly:<p>1. Poor performance will make sites unusable for people without good CPUs &#x2F; internet
2. Poor performance will waster energy and lifespan of devices<p>Point #2 is very weak, because the alternative to slow sites is spending time optimizing them which may waste human time. Its not obvious what the optimal ratio is to minimize total waste.<p>In order for #1 to be an ethical issue, I would require it to only or disproportionately affect those without high speed devices. However, web performance seems to scale decently so improving a sites performance on high end machines by 2 probably also improves it on low end machines by ~2."

So at one point we where doing scale testing for our product where we needed to simulate systems running our software connected back to a central point. The idea was to run as many docker containers as we could on a server with 2x24 core and 512GB of RAM. The RAM needed for each container was very small. No matter what the system would start to break around ~1000 containers (this was 4 years ago). After doing may hours the normal debugging we did not see anything on the network stack or linux limits side that we had not already tweaked (so we thought).So out comes strace! Bingo! We found out that the system could not handle the ARP cache with so many end points. Playing with net.ipv4.neigh.default.gc_interval and the stuff associated with it got us up to 2500+ containers.
"Thanks for the release. Excited about the scripting API. Sometime I wanted to add &quot;autocomplete&quot; features to iTerms (just like on phones), but the completion predictions will be sourced from stackoverflow. When user types a part of the command, I was planning to add an extra line to the current list of predictions (which are taken from bash command history). Unfortunately, append operation was not supported because of the way the code was written(by the time key is pressed, list is already populated and sent to the handler). So, I could not proceed then.<p>Hopefully this python API fixes the problem."

"I hosted a BBS in the mid 90&#x27;s and it was a pain until OS&#x2F;2 Warp and the 5th MB of RAM on a 486&#x2F;66 that allowed me to run the BBS while still using my computer. Most of the traffic was photos of places abroad or girls. Every Christmas I left it without any ratio, the utilization was almost 100%."
I&#x27;m happy to see more languages with optional typing.<p>Prototyping stuff without bothering with types and adding them when your code matures to root out some bugs and make it more futureproof seems to me like the best of both worlds.
"Would downvote this if I could.<p>1) Google bough reCAPTCHA in the first place.
2) Google&#x27;s latest captcha isn&#x27;t even a captcha, you just click a button saying you are human and it analyzes your mouse movement and probably a fingerprint of sorts and you are in.<p>The article just isn&#x27;t accurate and seems unnecessarily hateful about things that are not exactly true."
"An ophthalmologist I know is an attending physician, which means she teachers new resident physicians.<p>She described a few surgeries to me and her role in the room as the resident performs the surgery.

"&gt;Proof of work is not foolproof, especially in LF where there is no intrinsic economic mechanism to incentivize the runaway growth of PoW &quot;mining&quot; investment. As a result a well financed or determined attacker willing to throw a lot of compute power at the problem could overcome the PoW &quot;weight&quot; of the records beneath a target record in the LF DAG and replace it.<p>This issue -- of creating equivalent proofs of work -- is what I was most interested to see if there was any novel art (which it appears there isn&#x27;t).<p>Bitcoin&#x27;s difficulty adjustment is the only well-functioning algo that deals with the economic coordination issue around how to -- without any third party coordinator -- equate the value of a proof of work made by computer&#x27;s of differing computational capacities (a phone, an ASIC).  All PoW consumed by Bitcoin has marginally positive contribution to the system.  Sacrificial PoW (as in LF, hashcash) only has value if reorgs happen.  It also results in a system with tenuous game stability properties (&quot;When will it be uneconomical for an attacker to reorged these records out of the DaG?&quot; &quot;Can&#x27;t say, blocks&#x27; PoW requirement is arbitrary&quot;) vs bitcoin (&quot;When will this 50 BTC txn be uneconomical for the most adversarial miner to reorg out?&quot; &quot;well there&#x27;s about 14 BTC of block reward per block so about 4 blocks ~40-60 minutes&quot;"

"While it is a bit dated in terms of the &#x27;types&#x27; of applications it is still quite relevant in terms of understanding &quot;web 2.0[1]&quot; distributed system reliability versus other systems.<p>One of the coolest things Greg Lindhal built at Blekko was a system that processed the error logs of every single system in the cluster all at the same time. It then reduced by string matching error messages that varied only by their variables into a single error (so &#x27;error reading sector 10 on disk sda3&#x27; and &#x27;error reading sector 20 on disk sde2&#x27; would reduce to &#x27;error reading sector X on disk Y&#x27; x={...}, y={...}&#x27;) really fun stuff. And you could easily pull out of that errors in the software (happens on many nodes) errors in hardware (happens on unrelated nodes) and errors in infrastructure (happens on nodes correlated by a switch or PDU or Rack)<p>[1] Distributed systems made of many many identical nodes both from a software and hardware perspective, managed by an orchestration service with software that assumes unreliable platforms."

"This is very true, but it&#x27;s also important to remember that the drift might not indicate that anyone has lost their way. The needs at a company of twelve people are different than the needs at a company of a hundred, a thousand, ten thousand. At the disruptor vs. the incumbent. Pre-profit vs. post-profit. I know people who have been first developer or first COO&#x2F;CMO&#x2F;VPE at multiple companies, leaving each without any rancor whatsoever when those companies outgrew their own ideal skillset and working style.<p>Sometimes people and companies <i>naturally</i> grow apart. While the OP&#x27;s point that it&#x27;s not always your fault is a good one, the conclusion (that if it&#x27;s not your fault it must be the company&#x27;s) does not follow.

I&#x27;ve read it before, and I spent a few hours reading it this weekend, and it&#x27;s beyond clear to me that it absolutely had the potential to radicalize shooters and terrorists. I&#x27;m not referring to the simple use of racial or ethnic slurs -- of course this was extremely common there, but I don&#x27;t think this is the part of the site that encouraged actual violence. Rather, among the many ideological threads that were more or less constantly ongoing on 8chan, one of them just straight-up encouraged mass shootings. &quot;The fire rises&quot; is a common phrase I saw there celebrating the frequency of shootings. For instance, here&#x27;s a quote I saw this weekend (I screenshotted a bunch of stuff like this in anticipation of the site going down):<p>&quot;holy fucking shit, a third mass shooting toda [referencing an incident near Douglas Park in Chicago], white guy shot 7 people, no one dead yet but the meter is still running!!! shooter still active!!!<p>its absolutely fucking happening !!! the FIRE RISES!!!&quot;<p>This was attached to a picture of Trump with the text &quot;it&#x27;s happening&quot; superimposed.<p>While 8chan overall was absolutely all over the place, this thread of support for shootings and terrorism was seemingly always present in the background."

"This is interesting - it says that they are connected to an internet exchange point (IXP), which means presumably they are their own AS and don&#x27;t pay for peering. It makes them basically a peer of Verizon, etc..<p>It&#x27;s a bit of a reminder of what the internet actually is - a bunch of networks connected together. If you make your own network, negotiate or purchase a piece of the IPv6 address space, and convince someone to connect to you and exchange BGP routes then you are part of it.<p>I wonder how hard it is to join an IXP and how much it costs?"
Mid-40&#x27;s here. I&#x27;m in management but considering getting back into development&#x2F;architecture.

We pay a premium for the service and not to have better chances of surviving.<p>In an alternate universe, we could have had cheaper airline tickets which had not so great safety record and the good ones only in reach of the super wealthy.<p>[1]: I’m aware it may not be the case in some countries with completely free healthcare, but this applies to the majority of the world.

"Yep... I returned yesterday from Germany and it is <i>awful</i>. I thought the UK (rural) was bad, but Germany takes the cake. There are even (expensive) hotels which still ask money for using their wifi. When you go to have only a meal at a hotel, they tell you internet is just for guests (we had this 5 times in 2 weeks). And driving around with 3g&#x2F;4g you notice massive patches without data reception. I live in the mountains of Spain where I have cheap 4g and even cheaper &#x27;radio&#x27; uplinks. They are enough to download gigs a day (not that I need that; I need stable, not a lot of bandwidth, but it&#x27;s both).

"Somewhat related, my brother is a musician (playing what you might call experimental music) and says Japan is an amazing place to play as the audience pays close attention to what you&#x27;re doing and remains quiet whilst you&#x27;re playing.

Whereas in a lot of places I&#x27;ve been people are going to hang out with friends and the music is secondary."
"This is a very complex situation and a lot of factors need to be considered.  Everyone seems keenly aware that 8chan was a place where hateful ideologies could fester and spread, and nobody wants that.  But it seems few people are aware of the fact that cutting people off from society usually results in feelings of social rejection that drive people deeper into isolation, bitterness and hatred.  Being socially rejected, or believing such, is fairly strongly coorelated with mass murderer psychology.[1][2]  This action could actually have the opposite effect of what was intended.<p>There is also an effect similar to martyrdom where whenever some subgroup of society is mistreated they gain in power. Many see being cut-off as over-the-top and thus a mistreatment, irrespective of the fact that the group has a clearly evil ideology. There is a risk this action will embolden their cause, as a natural instinct to protect the mistreated and come to the defense of the underdog kicks in. Read some of the other comments and you&#x27;ll see what I mean. This comment itself is admittedly partially motivated by my instinct to come to the defense of the mistreated (granted the obviousness that the murdered and their families are clearly the most mistreated).<p>Like I said, this is complicated. The simple ideological answers are simply not good enough.<p>So the hard question is this: how do you prevent the spread of their ideology without excising them from (online) society?  I believe it is possible, but it is going to take a more nuanced approach going forward. We could start by not labelling people as racists or white supremacists. We should reserve these labels for actions, words and ideologies, not people. Attack the ideas, not the people. Deplatform (censor) the posts (if you control the platform), don&#x27;t ban the accounts. Throttle accounts of repeat abusers as necessary. And always be willing to talk.<p>BTW I always feel queasy posting things like this to HN because I know some people will utterly reject me and downvote me, but I feel this point is just too important.<p>[1] Katherine Newman, <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.livescience.com&#x2F;21787-predicting-mass-shootings.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.livescience.com&#x2F;21787-predicting-mass-shootings....</a>

"Free speech is a cultural value. It sometimes manifests itself in the form of codified laws like the first amendment to the US Constitution. However, free speech is not limited to the USA.<p>The idea behind free speech is that people are allowed to put forward new ideas ( especially ideas about how to organize society, what is good and moral etc ) so that people can consider and accept or reject them. The idea is that no entity has a monopoly on truth and if you want to propagate your ideas, make your arguments persuasive and refute your opponents&#x27; arguments.<p>Free speech is ultimately a bet on human capacity for reason and goodness. The idea is that good ideas should win adherents and bubble to the top while bad ideas sink to the bottom as they lose followers.<p>Sometimes, governments are the most powerful enemy of free speech while sometimes other entities can be.<p>I am not saying free speech is a good thing, but there is no &quot;exclusive to government&quot; limiting principle to free speech."

We have high standards for our code, and everything to push goes through a rigorous code review. We&#x27;re ok if it takes a little longer to get things right because we believe it leads to better products, better software, and happier engineers in the long term. There&#x27;s obviously a tradeoff between speed and quality, and while we&#x27;re always trying to find the sweet spot, we tend to err on the side of shipping well designed software.<p>Related to this, engineers are expected to give input on the product. It&#x27;s not &quot;here&#x27;s a spec, go build exactly what it says.&quot; We think building great products is a &quot;contact sport,&quot; meaning there&#x27;s typically a lot of (respectful!) debate and refinement over the things we build before they reach their final form. This means pointing out the UI inconsistencies and UX awkwardness when starting to build out the frontend or coming up with novel ways to leverage the immense dataset we have on the backend to drive better outcomes for our customers.<p>We also do a lot of team activities here. Whether it&#x27;s trivia or game nights, or lunch with the team, or our bi-weekly lunch &amp; learn where we rotate presenting to the rest of the engineering team on technical topics that are interesting to us.

"“it seems to be a spontaneous, meaningful event that goes well beyond the occasional “good days” most dementia patients experience. The period of clarity is brief, lasting minutes, hours or possibly a day. It seems to come in the hours, days or weeks before death”<p>Based on my understanding of “why we sleep” and seeing complicated things fail, I wonder if their brains reach a maximally deteriorated state that somehow cancels out the damage temporarily. It might be helpful to find out whether people in these episodes seem truly “in tact” and able to recall their memories across their whole lives. Or, if it tends to be some minute portion of their memories.<p>Don’t know, but I genuinely wish this disease to perish. How it took my family members was just evil."

"Great article overall, but I have a serious beef with it and others I’ve seen like it: the writer quickly lapses into saying there’s a problem in “science” and with “scientists”. But p-value testing is not widely used in fields such as chemistry, condensed matter physics, materials science etc. (And I imagine many other scientific fields, such as sub fields of biology, although the ones I just listed are ones I know well.)<p>So this kind of overgeneralization is a serious error and could contribute to more mistrust of science by the general public."

"Let me break it to you, there <i>is</i> no perfect language, just the ones most general purpose enough to cover most common problems and most suited for your applications. Each language has it own use and one doesn&#x27;t trump another in terms of functionality or usage, they only compete when they lie in the same paradigm and this is where most language oriented comparisons are drawn whether be it time of execution or performance. This is also why there are more than one language within the same paradigm, as each one tends to have it&#x27;s own intricacies and features that was solely developed for the purpose of improving upon it&#x27;s predecessor. So there you are, stuck with more than one language to suit your needs and hence the untenable need for a perfect language.<p>Also, trying to bend a certain language to adopt features and functionality that are unwarranted for it&#x27;s use cases is another reason for the criticism some languages draw upon from the community, therefore it&#x27;s best for the language to stick to what it does best and stop it at that instead of trying to fit in to uses which it was never intended for when it was first developed. But the language itself is agreeable to evolve through time, but to constrain itself to it&#x27;s actual purpose would be better for both the language and it&#x27;s users."

"When a phone is “locked”, what does that entail? Is there a list of IMEIs somewhere that carriers check against when phones connect to their network, or is it something on the handset itself? If it’s software on the phone, surely it’s possible to hack it on the phone itself?"
"This is a nice article. For those who have not yet read it (it&#x27;s short, read it!), a one-paragraph summary: the author starts with a list of random numbers. Visualizing it (plotting the numbers, with the list index on the x axis) suggests &#x2F; leads to (for the author) curiosity about how often numbers repeat. Plotting <i>that</i> leads to the question of what the maximum frequency would be, as a size of the input list. This can lead to a hypothesis, which one can explore with larger runs. And then after some musings about this process, the post suddenly ends (leaving the rest to the reader), and gives the code that was used for plotting.<p>This article is essentially an encouragement and a reminder of our ability to do experimental mathematics (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;w&#x2F;index.php?title=Experimental_mathematics&amp;oldid=899918382"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;w&#x2F;index.php?title=Experimental_math...</a>): there&#x27;s even a journal for it, and the Wikipedia article on it is worth reading (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;w&#x2F;index.php?title=Experimental_Mathematics_(journal)&amp;oldid=894684677"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;w&#x2F;index.php?title=Experimental_Math...</a>).

"If you are willing or able to live within reach of public transport or bike&#x2F;walking, a no-car life is awesome.  I did many years of tense heavy US traffic before I moved to NL, and I must say it&#x27;s so awesome to not own or care about a car.<p>The US is mostly not designed for car-free situations.  That&#x27;s a long story, but it ends in &quot;limited decent public transport options&quot;.  To go into that topic would be too political here.  Suffice to say, unless you live in a progressive part of the US (or you move to within walking range of your job), you need a car.<p>Europe has the advantage? of being much older, when cities were more dense.  There&#x27;s no place to affordably park a car, so you must walk or bike, or use a bus&#x2F;tram (or metro&#x2F;train if you&#x27;re lucky).<p>There are certainly times in summer in the Netherlands during peak time when a full train (standing room only) really truly sucks.  But that&#x27;s less than 1&#x2F;4 of the year.  The rest of the time I can work, sleep, look at the attractive fit people, or even talk to people.  My days of driving in big Texas city traffic were certainly not that.  (Guns actually do get plucked out of glove boxes and waved as a threat from time to time.)"

"&gt; we are terminating 8chan as a customer<p>Probably a good idea, if only to send the message that there is a limit to how much garbage you can allow people to dump on your site before the neighbors decide to do whatever it takes stop the terrible smell.<p>&gt; The Rule of Law requires policies be transparent and consistent.<p>That&#x27;s great! Most tech companies seem to prefer the Rule of Men where they try to fix problems behind the scenes with obscured methods and inconsistent (and often arbitrary) policies.<p>&gt; Cloudflare is not a government.<p>While technically true, as your control of infrastructure approaches monopoly, you tend to acquire more and more government-like traits. At a functional level, &quot;is a government&quot; is not a Boolean value.<p>&gt; that does not give us the political legitimacy to make determinations on what content is good and bad<p>That&#x27;s true, but your success in the market (&quot;a result of that, a huge portion of the Internet now sits behind our network&quot;) gives you a lot of <i>power</i> to make that kind of determination. If that power isn&#x27;t managed carefully (e.g. with a consistent and transparent Rule of Law), it is easy to accidentally use that power in dangerous or irresponsible ways. The fact that you&#x27;re even talking about a Rule of Law means you&#x27;re already acting far more responsibly than most big tech companies.<p>&gt; We will ... engage with lawmakers ... as <i>they</i> set the boundaries of what is acceptable ... through <i>[their]</i> due process of law. And we will comply with those boundaries when and where they are set.<p>(I&#x27;m interpreting &quot;[their] due process of law&quot; as referring to the lawmaker&#x27;s process, not something implemented internal to Cloudflare. If this is incorrect, ignore this section)<p>Engaging with lawmakers (and other relevant organizations) is incredibly important. I would expect any company that wants to act lawfully to comply with legislated regulations. It is also important to realize that governments are often slow. You cannot simply abdicate responsibility to the government when you <i>de facto</i> have significant power over and involvement with a problem.<p>&gt; We ... have an obligation to help propose solutions<p>Yes, proposing solutions is part of that obligation. If you really are concerned with creating Rule of Law, then you also have to act in ways consistent with that goal. If you&#x27;re going beyond the limits of an uninvolved&#x2F;neutral &quot;common carrier&quot; and terminating a customer for reasons unrelated to the technical services you provide, you need to make sure you <i>have</i> and <i>follow</i> your own &quot;due process&quot;, while the lawmaker&#x27;s solution is still pending and&#x2F;or incomplete.<p>&gt; What&#x27;s hard is defining the policy that we can enforce transparently and consistently going forward.<p>I agree that this is very hard. It&#x27;s also an obligation you accepted when you decided to take responsibility (and profits) for a large piece of infrastructure that many people now rely on. This is where transparency can help a <i>lot</i>; it&#x27;s a lot easier to ask for forgiveness for a mistake if you have a reputation of openly explaining your reasoning."
"If you build a system that is technically possible for someone to censor, particularly if you make it easy to do (and in fact where not doing so would cost them potentially billions of dollars in market cap in an upcoming IPO, recruiting, sales, vendors, etc), you shouldn’t be at all surprised when they do censor.  It is interesting that Cloudflare has only really censored two sites (dailystormer and 8chan) outside of a fairly clearly articulated terms of service. There are clearly a large number of sites on Cloudflare which are a net liability to them and always will be, so the “free speech” stance is genuine."

"Rifled through it, seems to be just the standard stuff.<p>I was particularly disappointed by:<p>&gt; The bad news is that this is a little harder than using the Monkey Rules to calculate derivatives. In some sense the Monkey Rules, particularly the Quotient Rule and the Chain Rule, &quot;blow functions up&quot; when they systematically calculate derivatives. In order to go backwards, and undo the Monkey Rules to find antiderivatives, you need to think a bit like a forensic analyst who studies the site of an explosion to see what sort of bomb was used. We&#x27;ll discuss this analogy more later when we practice finding antiderivatives.<p>(&quot;Monkey rules&quot; are the derivation rules, this kind of cuteness is a big part of the purported dumbing down)<p>Anyway, systematically calculating derivatives was always a big sticking point for, as indeed you often need to use multiple rules and it&#x27;s not quite obvious which chaining of rules will get you there. I was hoping the authors could introduce a systematic algorithm (which no doubts exists but I never bothered looking up - I don&#x27;t do much integrals day to day) or at least some strong form of intuition that goes beyond &quot;if we did this we&#x27;d have something on which we could apply that rule&quot;."
"One thing I don&#x27;t understand is, why are they doing live testing above inhabited areas? Until the tech is proven, the only right thing to do is to implement drones routes that avoid populated areas as much as possible, or at least go thru very sparsely populated areas by default, until all failure modes are well understood."

"I get the sentiment, but wouldn’t this apply to something as simple and fundamental to the web as including an image that I don’t host on my webpage?

"There are many times when the political, religious, or other leanings of people committing these crimes have been misrepresented by &#x27;media&#x27; organizations and politicians and others pushing an agenda, and trying to tie the despicable acts to their opponents, etc., or to make political points.<p>I&#x27;ve seen far left crazies characterized as far right.  I&#x27;ve seen atheists characterized as being christian.  I&#x27;ve seen mentally ill people characterized as following some ideology.<p>In this sort of environment, cutting off access to raw sources just makes these kinds of mischaracterizations even easier to do.<p>Cutting off people&#x27;s ability to communicate does not have any benefit.  All it does is signal that those cutting off the communication do not have a better idea, or do not know how to sell their idea.  It strengthens the hand of those being censored by giving them a real grievance, and makes it more likely that they will find other ways to express their views, which will likely be more violent."

"I’ve had a blog for about a decade now - I wanted to host it myself rather than use some blogging infrastructure, since I was afraid that blogging infrastructures would become evil in the future (see: Medium).  I also wanted a comment section, but as soon as I turned it on, I got hundreds of spam messages every. single. day.  I shut it down and started working on adding captcha support.  My custom captcha solution did pretty much nothing to slow down the spammers, and I realized how much time and effort I was going to have to spend developing and maintaining it… I decided to hand the reins over to the fine folks at Google, instead.  If they want to recoup their costs by having visitors on my site spend a few seconds training self-driving cars, that’s a trade-off that’s worth it.  It’s also worth noting that the article doesn’t actually point out anything that’s particularly evil - just points out the potential for some evil in the unspecified future.  Although I agree that the best time to tackle evil is now rather than later, I also don’t see any alternative for recaptcha, so I’m going to continue to use it and hope for the best."

"I think of high contrast areas as having the strongest mood boosting.  By that I mean river fronts, visible mountain ranges, the beach, the edges of forests.  No doubt trees in cities are visually pleasing, living in the middle of dark dense forest not so much.<p>&#x27;round these parts, trees seem to perform two useful functions.  They fall on houses during storms (quite common) or they burn down whole towns.  Be careful what you wish for."
ATT support is awful.<p>I recently had to contact support and through chat support the person said they were adding notes to my account. Of course when I call support another day they have no record of this. They then proceed to forward my call to 2 other departments each of which has no idea why I&#x27;m calling. I talked to each of these people for several minutes.<p>How can a company possibly function like this?

"I was wondering how people who live in cities in carless mode manage when they have kids. Since I could not find by simply skimming the comments, I searched for &quot;kids&quot; keyword, but so far it only appears twice in 200+ comments. Do people move out of cities immediately when they have kids or they have no opinion about this topic?"
"A problem with multitasking is that people may choose to work on a project that is not the most important project for the company to complete.<p>Assume a company that has six projects, started but not finished, in its portfolio.<p>The value of those projects, when delivered, will not be equal. Some will likely be 10x or 20x the revenue of others in the portfolio.<p>If people are multitasking, they are jumping around from project to project. The most important project to complete (A, let&#x27;s say) is standing still while people work on the other projects. Every so often, A gets some attention and so it makes some progress towards completion. But before too it has to wait again when less important projects are worked.<p>The company suffers because valuable projects take longer than they should to complete and begin earning money for the company. Sales that are not made because the product is not available for sale are never recovered. Developers are deprived of the satisfaction of completing projects frequently because projects always seem to take too long to finish.<p>Bottom line, cutting your work in process often brings dramatic improvements.<p>Thoughts?"

"There were (maybe still are) tons of such mesh networks run by small commercial operators in Germany&#x27;s rural areas, usually using directional radio to create connections between villages and then meshing all the wifi consumer routers to span wifi over the village. They did that&#x2F;do that because the major commercial providers (i.e. Telekom) weren&#x27;t exactly fast laying fiber to these villages.<p>A buddy of mine used to run such a network spanning 3 villages with about 400 customers a bunch of years back. I seem to remember one of the directional antennas was strategically placed in some church tower.<p>They ran this as a two people operation. Extreme weather also was a problem for them, and they essentially learned network design by trial and error, starting out as a fully bridged network where everybody was in the same 10.0.0.0&#x2F;8, NATed to the outside. They fixed that later. Customers only got like 3-4MBit&#x2F;s from this mesh, which wasn&#x27;t exactly fast but not too shabby either back then, especially considering the only alternative those villagers had was ISDN speeds (128kbit&#x2F;s max I think). No LTE yet either.<p>They weren&#x27;t alone either. There was a huge number of such operators who shared knowledge etc.<p>Once he started negotiating with those villages to lay fiber and provide DSL service all of the sudden the Telekom started fibering up &quot;his&quot; villages."

"Not just Europe!  Tokyo, for example, is a remarkably pedestrian and bicycle-friendly city, despite also supporting quite heavy traffic in some areas.  And of course, the extensive train network completely eliminates the need for a car in daily life.<p>If you pick a random place on the map (like [1]), you&#x27;ll see that the high-speed traffic is very well-separated from residential areas, with infrequent intersections.  There is also little incentive to take a &quot;shortcut&quot; through residential areas since neighborhood roads are so narrow.  The result is that neighborhood are safe and quiet enough that parents feel safe letting their small children walk along the road.

"I&#x27;ve always been dubious of using mock for tests which involve external API calls; at best they require you to reimplement the API according to the documentation (which there may be none, or that the API doesn&#x27;t follow exactly for edge cases (i.e. the things you&#x27;re meant to be testing)). At worst you&#x27;re implementing a very small subset of the behaviour of the API and not testing how your code responds to the other behaviour.

"The most toxic example of Agile&#x2F;Scrum I&#x27;ve come across so far has been in a company that was non-technical at its core but wanted badly to pivot to a SaaS business model.

I think its just in a lot of companies culture that if they can instill some process, any process really, then the results will follow.  And software engineers complaining about the demoralizing effects of being micro-managed by junior coworkers who never wrote a line of code in their life are just typical spoiled tech workers.  Other companies I&#x27;ve worked for that used Agile methodology were not all that much better, just somewhat less absurd.

"I&#x27;m 42 and still coding. I have a lot of rambly thoughts. . . .<p>I love programming and don&#x27;t want to go into management, but it becomes really hard to keep upping your salary after the first 5-8 years or so. (And isn&#x27;t it silly how many job ads for &quot;senior engineers&quot; ask for 3-5 years of experience?) I could join a FAANG but I don&#x27;t really want to.<p>You <i>do</i> keep getting better, even when you keep changing the tech. It feels almost unfair that I started on the web in the early 90s (and was coding long before that) so I got to progress along with today&#x27;s complexity, starting with early HTML, CGIs, debugging HTTP &amp; SMTP with telnet, supporting IE 5 Javascript &amp; CSS, building websites with Perl &amp; Python run from an in-house app server we built in C, on &amp; on. You can go way down the stack and debug things quickly. You know all the junction points to do a binary search on where a bug is happening. Your intuition is well-honed. You have lots of perspective and good judgment. You get better at seeing the big picture, including crossing from the tech stuff to the business.<p>Back around 2005 I started doing freelance development (&quot;and consulting&quot;), and that has been a great path for me. I earn more, I work from home, I don&#x27;t live in the Bay Area, I get more responsibility and respect and variety and control. I&#x27;ve neglected to follow most of the patio11 and tptacek best practices, at least most of the time, but I&#x27;m still happy with how I&#x27;m doing. I&#x27;ve raised my rates a lot, and should probably raise them again. (At the moment I have four customers who all wish I&#x27;d give them 40+ hrs&#x2F;wk. . . .)<p>I&#x27;d like to experiment with value consulting. I&#x27;m much better at estimating than other devs will admit to.<p>My Plan A has been to start my own dev partnership, although it&#x27;s been hard to find the right people to get it off the ground. I really like <i>Managing the Professional Service Firm</i> by David Maister, and I think the partner&#x2F;associates model has great potential for making programming viable as a life-long career.<p>I haven&#x27;t tried hiring any people (full time or as contractors), except occasionally designers. Maybe I will soon but then you bill less yourself, you have to sell more, you have to manage them and their work, and of course you have to find people willing to charge less than you. (Tech is obviously supply-constrained right now, so getting good workers at a low cost is the #1 competitive advantage. Like everyone else, I believe I can recognize good developers when I meet them, but I don&#x27;t really have any great process or insights to make that part of a business plan.)<p>The longer you do it the more T-shaped you become. Eventually your T has more than one vertical line. :-) But still you kind of have to pick one focus to advertise, if only for credibility reasons. I say my specialties are Rails, relational databases, and devops. But then I also do lots of Python, Angular, and React, and I&#x27;m happy doing Java or C, even Android &amp; iOS. Right now I&#x27;m almost full-time with C#. :-&#x2F;<p>I&#x27;ve enjoyed finding researchy outlets for my spare time. In my case it&#x27;s temporal databases, but there are so many other cool things happening. I wish I had forty lifetimes to explore them all.<p>I&#x27;m glad I&#x27;ve fended off management so far. I&#x27;ve still had to learn lots about sales, finances, project management, contracts, collaborating, leadership, etc. I already spend plenty of time in Jira, customer meetings, and code reviews.<p>Probably ageism matters less when you&#x27;re independent. For one thing there are no 8-hour on-site interviews (even though you cost more!).<p>Anyway, I&#x27;m 42 and coding all day, and I&#x27;m very happy. I feel totally lucky to be in this career. I feel tremendous gratitude to our community. HN, Open Source, Linux, bloggers, O&#x27;Reilly, Stack Overflow, tech meetups, tech companies, friends &amp; colleagues: all have given me so much."

"&gt; The thing is, moving apartments has a high switching cost. It’s really something you want to avoid being forced to do, both for economic reasons and for social &amp; personal reasons. Now, Amazon has you trapped: however much you may be inconvenienced or disappointed by being effectively required to purchase Amazon’s stuff rather than other merchants, it’ll be less bad than the monumentally large cost of moving apartments.<p>Worse: in this scenario, &quot;Amazon&quot; competitors are unable to provide competitive pricing any more because everyone else, like you, waited a few cycles, and now they don&#x27;t get enough sales volume for that. It is no longer economical for you to leave for another apartment that doesn&#x27;t mandate this supply monopoly. The only way to break out of the cycle is if 1) a large proportion of people in your situation agree to move at the same time, which is particularly difficult because of individual circumstances as well as political will; and 2) all of you can afford to prop up the more expensive competing suppliers until volume discounts start rippling through the supply chain.<p>* I say &quot;Amazon&quot; because this is entirely hypothetical, as the author admits, and I think it&#x27;s rather unfair to use Amazon&#x27;s name like this, which the author does not."

"Software engineering is a field that evolves and you need to stay up to date. It&#x27;s far from the only field like that.<p>When you get out of school (or whatever path you took), you are knowledgeable about the current state of things. If you&#x27;re an entry level engineer, chances are you&#x27;ll have people teaching you what you don&#x27;t know, mentoring you, and generally expect you to learn with them. Of course, as high as software salaries are these days, your expectations then are still lower than the older folks. Chances are you have less things to pay for outside of student loans in the US.<p>As you get older, you can do 2 things: you can passively coast as long as you can, or you can actively keep yourself up to date. If you choose the later, your knowledge stays current and you keep adding experience, making you more and more valuable. Short of health issues getting in the way, that will never stop. You just keep getting better.<p>If you passively coast though, what you know becomes less and less relevant. For the first couple of years, experience gain &gt;&gt; the part of your knowledge that is outdated, so you still go upward. There&#x27;s a limit to that. That 35-40 yo line, assuming you started in your early to mid 20s, sound about right for when you lost more than you gained.

"I still use perl for handy one liners on the command line. E.g. I had a 1 GB log file where I wanted to generate a histogram of the intervals between certain log messages. I used a perl one-liner to extract the timestamp via regex (regexs are perl&#x27;s bread and butter), calculate the diff between the previous timestamp (easy because of auto string =&gt; double conversion), use the diff value as a key in a hash of counters (autovivification really handy here), then print the hash at the end with sorted keys using the Data::Dumper module. Took me all of 5 minutes to write. I don&#x27;t write Perl often but I am thankful that it exists."

"Thanks to Microsoft, it is now entrenched in the JavaScript and even the Language Server Protocol. Eventually they should just put UTF-16 on fire, and move to UTF-8 as all smart people did already.

"Amazon pay is shit. I was laughed out of the room for asking for a salary that some analysts make in finance.<p>People get paid so much more in finance than any other industry that I wonder why tech people aren’t more interested in those jobs.<p>Also the work is more exciting and challenging.

"Unison has been an indispensable tool for me for many years.

I have Unison set up to default to a &quot;common&quot; profile that includes nearly everything, but I can explicitly request a sub-profile if I want. I also have a separate profile that syncs the profiles themselves, so I can make profile changes on one machine and run `unison profiles` to upload them."

"&gt;<i>the software engineer depreciates only slightly more slowly than the machine he or she toils behind</i><p>The author takes a debilitating credibility hit with this statement. A computer can be worthless after 5 years.  So an engineer is what, worthless after 6 years?<p>He also chases this experience paradox too far.  When I (and believe it or not more than a few others) hire someone or negotiate pay I assign zero value to years of experience.<p>If being a seasoned veteran has any value, I want to discover it in relevant interviews through conversation, problem solving, wisdom, etc.  I could make a mistake and not see it but I&#x27;m not paying more because of a number.<p>Same with a recent graduate, there&#x27;s quite a bit of variation in maturity, communication skills (yes a fine weapon for an engineer to wield), and ability.  Some 22 year olds having been coding since they were 12 years old.  If all this seems to manifest value during the process, why would I possibly not pay this person more the than the standard &quot;new graduate&quot; scale and risk losing them to a competitor?<p>I realize not all will think this way and yes, some of the things written do happen but the tone is too alarmist.  It&#x27;s just something that can be unfair and a challenge but it&#x27;s not insurmountable. It&#x27;s not like being black in Alabama in 1950.<p>One thing older engineers should do is the same thing younger ones should.  Don&#x27;t just naively learn tech that&#x27;s interesting.  &quot;Interesting&quot; is important because it can grant effortless motivation and passion. But at least research and sort rigorously the salary differences for 20 different things along with variables like generalist vs specialist company size etc.<p>Then choose whatever the heck you want, because you&#x27;ve made a conscious decision about your preference to balance interest vs money and choose to make 75k or 250k a year in a state that doesn&#x27;t have to be on a coastline.<p>You can even try to put a less enlightened interviewer at ease by being honest.  You could tell them you can&#x27;t be demotivated even if you did take a salary cut, because you don&#x27;t build your identity on that because it&#x27;s not about me. It&#x27;s about how much market value I can deliver via tangible and measurable results.  It&#x27;s about whether I can actually help the company reach goals faster, add productivity and help the company be more successful.  And if can convince you such objective things are likely after our interview, I believe they should be the most decisive criteria for your decision.<p>Here&#x27;s some random 81 year guy. probably all washed up no doubt.

"I consider null to properly mean &#x27;a value outside some value domain&#x27;, and nil to mean &#x27;zero value in some value domain&#x27;, and both these values are useful, and can be assigned to variables of that value domain. So C&#x2F;C++&#x27;s definition of NULL pointers is a historical transgression that has now stuck, as far as I am concerned.<p>Examples:
p=null-pointer should mean invalid adress, p=nil-pointer should mean zero offset&#x2F;address. 
l=nil-list should be empty list, l=null-list is invalid list. So null-list could also be called undefined-list. 
c=null-character is correct as a character, and works well as a terminator. 
s=null-string undefined string, s=nil-string empty string &quot;&quot;."

"The basic issue is people do not want to pay for software if a &#x27;good enough&#x27; free replacement is available. Hence Mozilla having to source money from whomever is willing to give them, and hence the race to the bottom. This has been particularly true in browser space. We usually pay for using programs of similar complexity like PS or AutoCAD etc., but we have always taken it for granted that browsers should be free and&#x2F;or bundled. This works to the advantage of big players who can sink in the millions involved, which Mozilla is only alive today because of former momentum (user base). Forget about a browser startup or a community-maintained alternative. It has become too huge and complex an undertaking for anyone to bother as long as Chrome&#x2F;Edge&#x2F;Safari&#x2F;Firefox will be available, no matter if they turn into user-hostile mess."

Does the Raspberry Pi suffer from this? All but the latest models have less then 4GB of ram &amp; their storage is often slow SD flash (technically it could be fast but most people have cheap SD cards) so it&#x27;s fits this scenario perfectly.

Unless you can&#x27;t buy basically the same stuff from lots of other places this is simple the usual whining about &#x27;big cooperations&#x27;.<p>The reality is that amazon overs good prices and people like to shop there.<p>And yes, suppliers are gone complain, that amazon is evil, just like suppliers complain that walmarket is evil, just as suppliers always claim whatever larger reseller they sell to is a evil monopoly.<p>The definition of a monopoly in economics is if that seller can essentially employ monopoly pricing, but amazon prices are not incredible higher compared to the competition."
"For a good RPC abstraction, I think a key requirement is to easily and safely change the deployment separation between modules that use the abstraction – deployment separations being: in-proc, inter-process-communication and remote-procedure-call.<p>That is,<p>1. deploy the modules within the same process then the method invocation is most efficient;<p>2. deploy the module across separate OS processes on the same machine then the method invocation is via the best available OS IPC mechanism;<p>3. deploy the module across separate machines then the method invocation is over network with most efficient remote procedure call implementation.<p>A long time ago I worked on a project that used Corba (with ACE TAO) that had facilities like this and it made development, testing environments vs various production environment permutations a lot easier to build for and manage over multiple product lifecycles. Now-a-days, these Microservices frameworks are missing these (basic) features and it overly complicates the deployment scenarios.<p>Rather than hand-rolling 300 line custom RPC mechanisms like this one, I would rather prefer a more complete one that did solve the above problems."
"The internet loves to jack it to cable lacing but if it were really a silver bullet then you&#x27;d see it more.  It&#x27;s fine for holding wires together and being light weight but does little to protect wires from abrasion.  There&#x27;s a reason every modern wiring harness that isn&#x27;t going into (or near) space uses split or expanding loom secured at the ends or spiral loom (not sure what the real name for that stuff is). Not to mention that cable lacing is slower and more expensive and easier to screw up than wire loom.<p>Cable lacing has its uses but those uses are nowhere near as common as the internet would have you believe.<p>And before you ask, I feel similarly about the western union splice.  It&#x27;s an outdated relic from a time when man hours were cheap and materials were expensive.  They are very rare today for a reason.<p>And yes, I know this will be a very unpopular option here.  Most people who understands the nuance of the trade-offs of various ways of securing wires are smart enough to avoid commenting in here.  Obviously I am not that smart."

I&#x27;ve seen this article before. A lot of people that are active on the internet like to assume that everyone is using the latest tech and can just use whatever tech they like. This is rarely the case. I&#x27;ve spent the majority of my career tending to old code bases.<p>There is a lot of <i>legacy</i> code that is still working fine. There is a lot of old C# code bases that are working exactly as intended in now unsupported .NET versions.<p>One of the constant annoyances of some of the newer tech stacks is that developers constantly break the API meaning that when you upgrade the framework version you have to fix code and probably tests as well. It is absolutely infuriating when an API is changed when the old API was working perfectly well.

"Couldn&#x27;t happen to a nicer bunch of scum and villainy. The internet has to grow up and conclusively eject these kinds of people - don&#x27;t tolerate them, don&#x27;t tolerate their providers."
"The Christchurch madman livestreamed his vile murders using Facebook. Isn&#x27;t it long past time we removed that hate site, a nest of debauchery, from the internet as well? Of course there will be evil persons that will disagree and support the existence of hate sites, but it is not necessary for sane individuals to listen to anything they say."
Its important that a company distances themselves from this type of behaviour but even slightly spinning it as action against something is disingenuous at best. So much more needs to happen to really address these problems and Im fairly confident a cdn isnt the make or break for shootings in America.

"<i>they have innate understanding that being observed working is more valuable than the results of their work.</i><p>I&#x27;ve seen coders who knew this by heart forget this less than 5 years after entering management and become champions of forcing everybody into the office for 8:30 stand-ups and time tracking systems that enforce minute by minute &quot;project accountability&quot;.<p>I don&#x27;t know exactly how this happens, all I know is its like a damn force of nature.

"I have hemophilia, a genetically inherited X-chromosome linked disorder, inherited from the mother. Due to the fact males have an XY chromosome and mothers have two X’s, with one of the X’s containing the faulty gene, it’s possible for a mother to have children with and without the disease. In fact, there is a 50% chance each of her males will have the disorder.<p>Why am I telling you this? Because there is a test that can tell if the fetus has hemophilia or not by sampling blood via amniocentesis. When my mom was pregnant with my brother, she had this procedure done.<p>However, there were complications during pregnancy and my brother, although he was in fact born without hemophilia, has severe birth defects in his lower extremities. It was later found to be directly caused by the test itself.<p>Just goes to show what happens when you try to play god."
"I&#x27;m not sure how he&#x27;s getting swap even with swap off, but this seems to be the big disadvantage to having overcommit --- the memory allocator won&#x27;t ever say NO, so an application can keep allocating memory even if that memory becomes uselessly slow to actually access.<p>Then again, this &quot;allocation will never fail&quot; mentality has also lead to applications being written with such an assumption, and when allocations do fail, they crash. (Arguably, that&#x27;s better than thrashing the rest of the system.) I don&#x27;t know if the modern browsers will actually stop letting you open new tabs and just give an &quot;out of memory&quot; error instead of crashing, but that&#x27;s how most Windows programs are usually written --- without the assumption that allocations can never fail, because on Windows, they can."

"Actually this is great advice, I should do it more.
