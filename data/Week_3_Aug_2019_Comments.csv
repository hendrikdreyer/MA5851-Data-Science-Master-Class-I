"Back when I was at Mapbox and we were developing the library used for this sort of visualization, I did a take on my home city of Portland, OR in a similar fashion:<p><a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.mapbox.com&#x2F;visualizing-an-entire-citys-buildings-live-with-runtime-styling-453fe7e39ae6"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.mapbox.com&#x2F;visualizing-an-entire-citys-building...</a><p>(Disclaimer: some of the images, and especially the code formatting, don’t seem to have survived very well)<p>I wrote there a bit more about the data processing side of this, and I tried to make a compelling mobile visualization that was fast. I’d use it a lot for demo and pitch-type meetings, and especially with an HDMI connector direct from iPhone to a 50, 60 or 70” display, the frame rate and fluidity was super impressive.<p>To this day, I just plain love the tech that we built."
"Const won&#x27;t necessarily make things faster but constant values will (whether or not explicitly inferred). I noticed, for example, a 2x+ speedup in one of my ray tracers by downgrading my dynamic 2d&#x2F;3d&#x2F;4d vector class* to always have a constant size of 3.<p>* (poor choice, I know)"
"God, I wish people would stop using Python for these sorts of things.<p>It is an okay language, but after tracking down why it doesn&#x27;t build and considering messing around in my system and making either installing older versions of libraries or messing around with symlinks I stopped and asked myself &quot;really?  I want to spend my time fixing this?&quot; and just deleted the entire clone of the git repos.<p>Python is a nice language and all, but it is not a language suitable for writing applications that you distribute.  (I wish the Python core developer would devote some time to making Python less horrible for distributing applications, but after around 30 years, I don&#x27;t think so)."
"Interesting how much two of the big cloud providers are assisting the Rust project. Is GCP absent due to Chrome&#x2F;Firefox?<p>&gt; AWS has provided hosting for release artifacts (compilers, libraries, tools, and source code), serving those artifacts to users through CloudFront, preventing regressions with Crater on EC2, and managing other Rust-related infrastructure hosted on AWS.<p>&gt; Microsoft Azure has sponsored builders for Rust’s CI infrastructure, notably the extremely resource intensive rust-lang&#x2F;rust repository."
It&#x27;s a reasonable perspective to treat it as a security issue because it is a security issue.

"I agree that most anecdotal startup advice is BS, which is why I barely pay attention to it. What I&#x27;d like more of is textbook-like material offering terminology and detailed case studies.

"Not discounting this story, but I’d like to point out that raising concerns is a personal protective strategy for any cyber staff.

Would be super grateful for any feedback. Early stages but testers&#x2F;those interested please sign-up at www.thecapture.club"
Just to summarize (warm up those downvotes...):<p>* “almost certainly more” than 84% of stripe’s emissions will not be sequestered because it’s “financially infeasible”<p>* no mention of stripe’s actual carbon footprint<p>* talk of startups and trillion dollar industry “by the end of the century” but no mention of government intervention &#x2F; green new deal to turn the tide in the next decade before it’s too late<p>Verdict: free market ideologues are not ever going to be leaders on climate. We need massive mobilization at the federal level to hit the necessary emissions reductions within the next 12 years if we are to avoid a catastrophic rise in temperature.

"I grew up in the 60&#x27;s and 70&#x27;s.  To me, the biggest difference is that moms didn&#x27;t work back then.  Instead, they raised the kids.  I know dads seem to help a lot more with the house and kids than they did when I was growing up, but it seems common sense that with both parents working, they can&#x27;t spend as much time with their kids.<p>This has all kinds of consequences:<p>- day cares and babysitters are tending kids but aren&#x27;t really raising them (instilling the parent&#x27;s values, etc.)<p>- families eat out more because neither parent feels like cooking after working all day.<p>- no family time at night because of all the homework being assigned.  I never had any homework until high school, but now kids have it in elementary school.  Seems nuts.<p>Screens are a problem, but not just with the kids.  I have seen a family of 4 waiting for their table at a restaurant, and both the parents have their face in their phone even when their kids don&#x27;t have phones.  The kids are just looking around, bored and lost, with no one paying attention to them.<p>I&#x27;ve seen mothers pushing grocery carts, tapping on their phone, and completely ignoring their kid sitting <i>in</i> the grocery cart.<p>Instead of kids playing with trucks, kids watch other kids play with trucks - on their phone!

One thing that I found interesting was these two quotes:<p>&gt; Our current anti-tracking mitigations in WebKit are applied universally to all websites, or based on algorithmic, on-device classification.<p>&gt; If a party attempts to circumvent our tracking prevention methods, we may add additional restrictions without prior notice. These restrictions may apply universally; to algorithmically classified targets; or to specific parties engaging in circumvention.<p>Is this trying to say that WebKit will now apply restrictions to specific parties that the project feels is circumventing tracking prevention? I&#x27;m all for these features, but only if they&#x27;re applied evenly and in a clear way. The solution to circumvention should be mitigations against bypasses, not selective enforcement :&#x2F;"
"Everyone knows that only the intelligence community I mean Alphabet I mean Google is allowed to surreptitiously record everything about you they possibly can, without your knowledge or consent and regardless of what any law or public oversight says about it.<p>Good on them for not being the most oppressive pile of fucking shit in the history of reality after all."
"I have been living in the park &amp; taking calls at the lottery hotline for 25+ years, according to all but my guv, insurance provider &amp; LEOs. Some others may get a PO Box, but if X doesn&#x27;t fall under the umbrella of the former mentioned, they get all the mis-info I can feed them. Sadly, today the institutions I must rely on sell all that info to the highest bidders, anyway.<p>In the list of info gleaned from your phone # the writer forgot your online purchase history, vehicle VIN &amp; plate number and pretty much EVERY MOVE YOU MAKE day-to-day thanks to O&#x2F;L retailers, your cell provider, your TV&#x2F;provider, your DMV, your insurance provider, your city&#x2F;county&#x2F;state&#x2F;Fed &amp; everyone else under the sun selling your info.

It is, indeed, better than your social security #(in the States, anyway)."
"People are complaining a lot about how FB are enforcing things, and why they are explicit about their decision to remove these things was not based on the content, but the patterns of inauthentic activity and fake accounts.<p>Look what happened with Matthew Prince of Cloudflare. Relentless harassment from people who believe he should be more active in censoring his customers, especially after that last shooting. Even when he has reluctantly stepped in on some extreme cases, they still gave him no credit. Defining wrongthink is a slippery slope, and you’ll never make ideologues happy. If you even try, then next thing you know, you’re somehow culpable for everything you <i>didn’t</i> remove, or didn’t remove quickly enough. Then you get accusations of endorsing it, because you removed X but not Y, so you must approve of Y, right?<p>And where does it end? “Sprint are ‘literally Nazis’ for allowing David Duke to have a cell phone?”<p>It’s no wonder everyone is deathly afraid of policing based on content. The PR consequences are bad enough, but it’s also likely to lead into legal problems as well."

"Looks like a useful addition.  What would be even better is if they provided a GDB stub to allow for full remote kernel debugging.  Most hypervisors have support for a GDB stub, but for some reason it&#x27;s not the norm for cloud providers to expose it to customers.  It would be especially useful for unikernels.  Most kernels of any type don&#x27;t offer self-debugging over the network, because it&#x27;s hard and unreliable (you have to ensure that any functions you might want to set a breakpoint on aren&#x27;t needed by the debugger itself, which means you basically need a whole separate network stack).  But they can at least allow debugging userland processes; that doesn&#x27;t work with unikernels, which bake the entire system into the kernel."
"One thing overlooked in the article is that we no longer have mothers at home.<p>Society looks down on such women without considering how important constant attention is to children in their formative years.<p>Working households also have more stress and more bills (two cars, childcare, etc).<p>Why these points weren&#x27;t considered for the article is beyond me."
Kids making movies by remixing copyrighted content and perhaps shooting some more is the topic of Pirate Cinema by Cory Doctorow. Pretty good book that explores the social implications of such efforts.

"A suggestion that I also proposed to the Monica&#x27;s founder (with no reply, though) - make it possible to organize contacts around interests.

However with different people you have different shared interests."

"A friend once told me that you need to know 3 slavic languages to understand all of them very well. I learned that to be true from my own experience.<p>If you&#x27;re born in a slavic country, learning second and third slavic language can be a matter of few months.<p>Perhaps, the value such language comes in that it could be designed to cut this process down to simply learning one additional language.<p>The point is, you don&#x27;t need another language to speak with other slavs. Most slavs can understand each other you just need put effort into it.<p>Such language can perhaps broaden your ability to understand each other while speaking your native slavic language, instead of being a replacement language for all.<p>That&#x27;s where it could work in my opinion."

"The fair choice is a text box: enter your search engine url. If you don’t know what it is, google it. The purpose of the legislation should be to make users aware of their options, not to let google prefill it for them. Users bear much of the responsibility for creating monopolies and have a duty to be educated about the market, if they wish to keep having a free market.<p>This would create an incentive for search engines to spend the money on ad campaigns for brand awareness instead of bidding for google. Win win for the market"
"We can just go all the way and call it counter-intelligence, with a significant component of sigint.<p>OS developers and browsers will need to emit statistical noise to mask a users identity&#x2F;activity.

But we live in a cyberpunk world now, there are criminals who are learning to act more sophisticated. Eventually they&#x27;ll get leverage over an employee at Google&#x2F;FB&#x2F;etc and the data they get access to will be used offensively.<p>The current guys working in tech, tracking your every move are on the <i>friendly</i> end of the spectrum. They just want to sell you things, or get you hooked on e-cigarettes.<p>EDIT: Also a note that iOS doesn&#x27;t have any way to control app network access, I don&#x27;t think Android does either.

But when I use Windows I am surprise how slow some functions are.<p>Worse, I can use two different programs in Windows and one will be dog-slow compared to the other.<p>I blame the use of pre-written libraries that in turn call more libraries that in turn call still more.  There was a site on Windows bloat-ware, there were for example programs having multiple version of the same library link into the code even while the program only used one library ever.<p>Also the screen layout is runned thru a layout program&#x2F;library that slows things down, the layout system is great when you are designing the system, but once you reach the point of final and fixed design there are faster ways to display it.<p>on the other hand, management is too often cheap, and says &quot;It works, don&#x27;t it?&quot; and do not want to pay for the extra coding that would make so much faster."
"I&#x27;ve never been a fan of the idea that &quot;the company&#x27;s only purpose to deliver value to its shareholders.&quot;<p>So I&#x27;m glad that they call out additional stakeholders and put customers and employees at the top of the list. Customers who are willing to pay for some useful good or service and employees who are willing to do a good job delivering it also seem like pretty essential ingredients for a successful business.<p>Externalities are a real thing, so I&#x27;m glad they mentioned local communities and the environment.<p>However, there may be external effects on global communities as well. For example, Facebook delivers value to its customers (advertisers) but causes harm to Facebook users.<p>There are also companies that harm their customers directly, in spite of customers paying for the &quot;value&quot; that they deliver."

"I have been working remotely for 3-4 years, and I am currently job hunting.<p>I did not like working remotely honestly. As an extrovert, I did not like the isolation.

I had poor managers&#x2F;CTO that needed a good smack to the head because they were too scatterbrained, but I was not there to do it. Impossible over Slack.<p>Now that I am job hunting again, I am wary of remote jobs. Of the three roles I am pursuing now, only one is remote.

"Disappointed that this made it to the front-page of HN. Had it show up in my push feed because it was so popular; quite upset to click it and see the comments in here falling for someone who&#x27;s a crypto scammer:<p>- Redditor for 28 days; first post made to &#x2F;r&#x2F;investing and contained self-promotion for a website that functions as a search engine for stock market fundamentals (post removed by moderators, take a look using <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ceddit.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ceddit.com</a>)<p>- Has made a few, low impression comments across other trading subreddits (&#x2F;r&#x2F;algotrading and &#x2F;r&#x2F;securityanalysis)<p>- Claims to have been a trader at &quot;multiple Tier-1 US banks&quot;  for 7 years but a glance at their LinkedIn shows less than five and a half years (65 months) between two organizations<p>- Claims that they found, analyzed, and reproduced &quot;130+&quot; academic papers in only &quot;7 months&quot;. Even by superhuman standards, the outlook for completing this much work (at high quality) is grim. Here&#x27;s some napkin math:<p>7 months * 30 days = 210 days
16 hours (superhuman) * 210 days = 3,360 hours
3,360 hours &#x2F; 130 papers to reproduce = 25.8hrs per paper<p>These numbers are intentionally rough to show that even if we&#x27;re being generous, the idea that any one person could somehow recreate a full academic paper in less than two 16 hour working days is absurd. Add to this OP&#x27;s claim of spending &quot;weeks trying to reproduce [a paper&#x27;s] results&quot; and it the task becomes even more daunting.<p>This is possibly the biggest red flag of all -- or OP is the world&#x27;s first (and only) 100x developer.<p>- Does not provide any empirical data to back their claims, only provides the name (not a link) of one paper, and when asked in comments to provide more information -- fails to deliver.<p>This post desperately wants to come off as a research article but it&#x27;s missing all the fundamentals to make it so. If OP&#x27;s claims were true, why wouldn&#x27;t they post their raw findings? We could make that argument that there&#x27;s far too much to post, 130 papers would be a good bit of code, but there&#x27;s no reason that OP couldn&#x27;t provide a listing of the papers they &quot;reproduced&quot; at the bare minimum.<p>OP has made extraordinary claims: most if not all &quot;predicting the stock market&quot; papers are fraudulent, but has failed to provide any supporting evidence to back this up beyond their own words. As someone who just analyzed well over a hundred papers and postures themselves as a data scientist, OP should know that citing yourself doesn&#x27;t fly in this scenario.<p>- OP ends their post with the following: &quot;I try to write a bit on medium even though I&#x27;m not a great writer if you wanted to read more from me.&quot;<p>There&#x27;s absolutely nothing wrong with self-promotion, provided you&#x27;re a quality creator and are transparent about what is being promoted. OP is neither of these things.<p>Clicking the Medium.com link will take you to a blog post titled &quot;Crypto Trading Bots · A helpful guide for beginners [2019]&quot;. If you&#x27;re like me, you might assume this is a tutorial related to crypto trading bots. Perhaps information on setting one up, coding one yourself, or an overview of the landscape. It is none of these things.<p>Much of the article explains how cryptocurrency trading bots work -- which is great, but quickly goes down the path of telling the reader that most bots are garbage and won&#x27;t return a profit. Near the end of the post we&#x27;re advised how to choose a viable trading bot and are provided with three questions to ask ourselves:<p>1. What is the professional experience level of the senior leaders of that firm?
2. Are their algorithms widely known and openly available to anyone? 
3. Is their success aligned with your success?<p>Immediately after these questions are the following lines:
&quot;Unfortunately, choosing a trading bot to go with isn’t as trivial as answering these three questions. In my opinion, everything ultimately comes down to people.&quot;<p>What people, you ask? Perhaps someone like OP, who happens to be the founder of a trading bot platform. The post finishes off with a not-so-subtle advert for his company, along with the extraordinary claim that it will &quot;take full responsibility for the profitability of our clients&quot;. According to the OP, all you need to get rolling on his platform is &quot;$1000&quot; and &quot;to press a single button to get the bots started&quot;, never mind that the platform hasn&#x27;t launched and AFAIK there&#x27;s no start button to press.<p>Clicking through to the platform&#x27;s website will bring you to a scroll-jacked landing page full of marketing fluff. Scroll further down (or click the &quot;Get Started&quot; button) and you&#x27;ll see a pricing table with only one option currently available: pre-order a &quot;$145 single fee lifetime license&quot;. Compared to the two unavailable plans, $145 is a steal -- the next plan down would run you $660 ($55*12) a year. Combine this with the &quot;First 90 days profitability or money back guarantee&quot; and the whole damn thing sounds like an incredible deal. But you better act fast because this offer is only available to the &quot;first 1000 members&quot;.<p>OP&#x27;s other trading bot articles aren&#x27;t much better and in my opinion, directly promote his platform.<p>~~~<p>The whole thing sets off numerous alarm bells in my head -- and it should for you too.<p>A trader who worked at &quot;Tier 1 US banks&quot; should know that guaranteeing the profits on your first 1,000 customers is not only ridiculous but so ambiguous as to be useless. Every developer on this site should know that not a single one of us would be remotely capable of maintaining a death-march level working pace for 7 months, launching a (credible) startup, followed by making non-zalgoized Reddit posts lacking any reference to the void.<p>OP isn&#x27;t an OG superhuman developer who worked for a bunch of big banks and learned all the secrets. They&#x27;re a former trader turned wantrepreneur that&#x27;s resorted to dirty tactics to promote their venture. As far as I&#x27;m concerned, and maybe it&#x27;s inflammatory, but OP is a liar. Nothing more."
"Not all NMIs cause kernel panics. In fact in a normally running system you are likely to receive NMIs as part of the normal operation.

Nice achievement! But is it just an approximation of the content? It does not appear to be a scaled-down version of the web page - so I wonder how useful it really is. I wish there was a more substantial demo page with more graphical artefacts.

This is a solution looking for a problem that doesn&#x27;t exist.<p>For all practical purposes a properly implemented software random number generator provided by the OS is fine.

"I just want to share that I&#x27;m finding the practice of Zen meditation in the context of its overall philosophy to be profoundly helpful. I&#x27;ve read a substantial number of books on the subject. Books are only useful as pointers for how to practice; knowledge alone is useless in Zen. You have to practice, period. But the best books <i>are</i> useful as pointers for how to practice. And if anyone here is interested in exploring Zen, the single book that I feel does the best job of giving you what you need to really practice is &quot;Opening the Hand of Thought: Foundations of Zen Buddhist Practice&quot; by Kosho Uchiyama Roshi[1]. &quot;Zen Mind, Beginner&#x27;s Mind&quot; [2] is also a wonderful book, and it&#x27;s where I started. Its poetic manner of expression made me feel there was something there that I needed to explore. But the Uchiyama book just takes the cake for being very clear and down-to-earth, without watering down either the practice or the philosophy. After that it&#x27;s helpful to read commentaries on writings by Dogen. And, ideally, sitting regularly with other folks in a Zen center is extremely helpful. Avoid overly simplistic beginner&#x27;s Zen books. I can&#x27;t recommend them because they seem to distort the essence in an attempt to make it seem as approachable as possible.<p>[1] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Opening-Hand-Thought-Foundations-Buddhist&#x2F;dp&#x2F;0861713575&#x2F;ref=sr_1_1"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Opening-Hand-Thought-Foundations-Budd...</a><p>[2]  <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Zen-Mind-Beginners-Informal-Meditation&#x2F;dp&#x2F;1590308492&#x2F;ref=sr_1_3"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Zen-Mind-Beginners-Informal-Meditatio...</a>"

"I have been meditating 20 years now (zazen). I do 2-4 hours a day. Several 7 day retreats per year.<p>My starting motivation was  philosophical and academic interest. I was curious how it affects the mind. Then I did it because it seemed so hard to do, mind seemed like a buggy device I had no control over.     I also had self improvement goals at some point. And feeling balanced is a good feeling.<p>But there is no way I can justify the amount of time I spend  meditating with any of those.  Meditation teachers say that first you start to work with meditation, then it starts to work with you. The whole view of the world changes.<p>I&#x27;m completely secular humanist but meditation has turned into  spiritual practice. If I worship something, it&#x27;s this moment. Asking why I meditate is like asking why people go surfing. Staying in the moment and balancing on the  wave between the past and the future is not a activity you do for gaining any other goals. Being alive and experiencing the raw existence is something you sacrifice other things  in your life."
"One of the most memorable moments of my career was when I joined a project and, the very first day, had the equivalent of a “showrunner” sit me and another engineer down and pitch the project to us.<p>It was mostly the same pitch that the showrunner gave to get the green light for the project, and it was crackling with energy, excitement and potential. It was magical.<p>So many other times, I was kind of tossed into a team and had to piece together what we were making and even why and how. This time, though, I went from knowing almost nothing about this project to having a clear view of where we wanted to go and being thrilled to be on this journey.<p>Speaking of which, I can’t resist sharing a fantastic metaphor of a creative project as a journey from Pixar director Andrew Stanton (the following are all his words):<p>The hardest thing about directing an animated movie is keeping yourself excited about it. It&#x27;s hard enough to make the crew excited about it, but keeping yourself excited about it -- trying to remind yourself why you wanted to do it. Because it&#x27;s all about the details once you really start making the movie.<p>It&#x27;s no different than building a house, or, building a really extravagant mansion. There&#x27;s a million details that you have to spend more time with after the bigger ideas of where the rooms are going to go and how it&#x27;s going to be structured, and it can get you kind of bogged down.<p>Joe Ranft used to have this great expression that there&#x27;s always a point during the making of a movie where there&#x27;s sort of the Columbus where-is-the-land moment, where everybody on the boat is going &quot;You promised us the land. Where&#x27;s the land? We&#x27;re not seeing it!&quot;
And people get bogged down in all the minor problems or the major problems that won&#x27;t go away, and it&#x27;s all justified -- it&#x27;s all legitimate to have that response.<p>So, for me, to prevent that is to get really, really picky about what story you&#x27;re going to tell up front. And this is my opinion, and it&#x27;s not a rule. But if I have an idea that I kinda like, then I don&#x27;t want to do it. If I have an idea that affects every fiber of my being, like &quot;I want to see that movie made whether I make it or not&quot; -- it&#x27;s like that idea <i>has</i> to get on the screen -- that&#x27;s a real good quality to start with. Because it&#x27;s going to get attacked for the next four years. And there&#x27;s going to be, sometimes, weeks or months where nothing seems to be going right.<p>[...]
It&#x27;s like looking for oil or something -- it&#x27;s like &quot;where can I find something that has enough fuel that&#x27;s going to keep me going for years?&quot; Because there&#x27;s going to large stretches of time where nothing is working, nobody&#x27;s happy, everybody thinks that the sky is going to fall, and what&#x27;s going to get me out of bed is just because that idea still has to be on the screen.<p>So I want that when I&#x27;m going to go into battle. Because it&#x27;s going to be battle. So if I don&#x27;t have that going in, then I won&#x27;t go into it -- I won&#x27;t make that movie."

"So, I&#x27;ve seen the flip side of this. I have a friend who does building inspections for insurance companies. He sees what&#x27;s basically outright fraud all the time, but companies rarely press it. Think about it: their main incentive is to avoid paying out claims where they shouldn&#x27;t have to. They&#x27;re more than happy to deny a claim, stop offering your services to that person and let the next insurance company get defrauded by the person. The companies have minimal incentive to rat out their own clients (especially when they&#x27;re merely 95% sure it&#x27;s fraud), and so lawlessness can easily continue.<p>So, I can see both sides of this. The government might WANT to prosecute insurance fraud, but they&#x27;re rarely aware of it, because how would they find out?"

"This conversation has gone in a completely different direction from the article. We&#x27;re now all complaining about architects instead of the point it&#x27;s trying to make.<p>But you can&#x27;t fix that, so I&#x27;ll chime in.<p>In my opinion, an Architect is just a role that gives advancement opportunities to individual contributors that doesn&#x27;t go down a management path. You&#x27;re still a part of the dev team, and you still do work.<p>When I&#x27;ve been in that role, that&#x27;s how I treat it, and it&#x27;s worked out pretty well. Generally speaking, when the position gets treated that way, I&#x27;d get involved in new products or major changes. For major changes, there&#x27;s a specific thing we&#x27;re targeting that needs something different. An extra complexity or just a different approach. That&#x27;s all I focus on while writing the design document in response to the requirements document. Everything else is fine, but we need to do this one specific thing differently to make it work better. And this will have trickle-down effects on the rest of the system that&#x27;s going to have to accommodate it. If I&#x27;ve done my job well, those are reasonably doable without that much explanation. I&#x27;ll write the prototype that gets at the core of what needs to change, do code review with the team I&#x27;m eventually going to hand it off to, and explain my decisions in person. Once everyone is on the same page and gets what we&#x27;re trying to do, I can hand it off and move on to something else.<p>For new products it&#x27;s a little different. We want to make sure that we learn from our past wherever we can. Companies often have themes to their products and even a completely greenfield project isn&#x27;t totally different from other stuff you&#x27;ve done. There&#x27;s lots of stuff floating around that isn&#x27;t great, but it&#x27;s not so bad that you&#x27;re ready to invest in a &quot;major change.&quot; But if you had to do it all over again, you would do it differently.<p>That&#x27;s what you want to make sure you capture when you start a new project. So again, there&#x27;s requirements. And again, I write a tech document that represents my interpretation of the specs as it applies to the systems in play. The vast majority of these don&#x27;t really matter, and any competent developers on the team can handle them. So my input is to focus on the things that are non-obvious and caused problems for us in the past. But the end result is the same: I write the prototype, workshop it with the team that&#x27;s going to be taking it over, and hand it off and move on when everyone is confident that we all know what needs to be done.<p>Sometimes, it&#x27;s not either of those things. Sometimes there&#x27;s just a really annoying bug that needs tracking down and is really hard. It might not even be caused by the system your team is working on. You might need some cross-team investigation to figure it out. Sometimes you need a wider knowledge than a specialized team has. And sometimes it&#x27;s just because some shit is broken that you wrote 6 years ago, and no one noticed until now because no one used it quite this way back then, but now everyone uses it that way, and it&#x27;s awful, and half the reason you got promoted to architect is because that solution was mindblowing and novel, but now it sucks because no one knows how it works. Not even you. So it&#x27;s your problem, genius, so go fix it. And you go crawl in a hole of shame.<p>Architect as anything other than really super double senior engineer doesn&#x27;t make sense to me. Architect as an outside hire doesn&#x27;t make a ton of sense to me. Architect as a layer of management that&#x27;s not engaged in building software doesn&#x27;t make any sense to me at all.<p>Architect makes sense as a retention strategy. It makes sense as an upward path for ICs. Architects should mentor.
Architect shouldn&#x27;t be a special title. It should be a normal result of doing solid work over time by a person who wants to keep doing solid work instead of switching to management track just to justify a raise&#x2F;promotion.<p>Just my thoughts."
"From &quot;Debt, The First 5000 years&quot;:<p>L. Frank Baum’s book The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, which appeared in 1900, is widely recognized to be a parable for the Populist campaign of William Jennings Bryan, who twice ran for president on the Free Silver platform – vowing to replace the gold standard with a bimetallic system that would allow the free creation of silver money alongside gold. … [O]ne of the main constituencies for the movement was debtors: particularly, Midwestern farm families such as Dorothy’s, who had been facing a massive wave of foreclosures during the severe recession of the 1890s. According to the Populist reading, the Wicked Witches of the East and West represent the East and West Coast bankers (promoters of and benefactors from the tight money supply), the Scarecrow represented the farmers (who didn’t have the brains to avoid the debt trap), the Tin Woodsman [sic] was the industrial proletariat (who didn’t have the heart to act in solidarity with the farmers), the Cowardly Lion represented the political class (who didn’t have the courage to intervene). The yellow brick road, silver slippers, emerald city, and hapless Wizard presumably speak for themselves. “Oz” is of course the standard abbreviation for “ounce.”"

Previously that cost them $1m USD.  Now it only costs them $857k. In both cases I’m getting 6m yuan, so I’m happy.  Or, do I increase the price to 7m yuan because I know that’s what the customer Usually pays, now I’m VERY happy?<p>Does this achieve the goal of growth (6m to 7m yuan) or does it not count because the volume stayed the same?"

"Nice paper.<p>It is interesting to note how practical data structures have evolved over the last 20 years, since this paper was written. Balanced trees were pervasive back then and the primary workhorse in all database systems I designed or worked with. Today they are rarely used in new system designs, since the practical tradeoffs started making less and less sense over a decade ago. Balanced trees have a very high space overhead that becomes prohibitively costly as data sizes grow.<p>Succinct implicit tree structures are unbalanced, so in theory have higher latency variance, but they also can have a space overhead 2-3 orders of magnitude smaller. As a practical consequence, the cost of traversing a level in the tree is dramatically lower than for balanced trees. The number of levels traversed tends to be used in literature as a shorthand metric for &quot;optimality&quot; but it smuggles in the assumption that traversal costs are similar across algorithms in practice. Searching a nicely balanced O(logn) gigabyte metadata structure has a hard time competing with an equivalent unbalanced tree that fits the metadata entirely in L2 cache, even when the tree is very unbalanced (and the average case is much better).<p>I am not entirely sure when I stopped using balanced trees. I went from always using balanced trees to never using balanced trees, gradually over many years."
"Welcome to the world of soft realtime applications. Sounds like this one is just so bad that a) the designers didn&#x27;t realize that was what they were designing and b) consequently it failed to meet any of its deadlines in the UI domain.<p>One detail I&#x27;ve noticed is that even if you do a shitty job of hitting the deadlines, users will often find workarounds. As long as a critical mass of features respond consistently within the deadlines, users will fiddle around to make the rest work-- even if you tell them directly that it isn&#x27;t possible.<p>Say the dropdown menus here performed fast enough, but going to the &quot;next page&quot; required a bunch of DOM mutation or something that grinds to a halt for two seconds.

This seems to be measuring the volume of messages with particular keywords on each day. I think that people wishing &quot;happy birthday&#x2F;thanksgiving&#x2F;christmas&#x2F;Valentine&#x27;s Day&quot; may not actually mean they are happy.

"No, the polarization (and attendant culture war) has been going on longer than social media as we know it have existed. It doesn&#x27;t help, but it&#x27;s just not the big factor it&#x27;s assumed to be either - an assumption driven by social media companies&#x27; desire to trade engagement for ad $. The people who are doing most to drive social polarization are the least likely to be motivated by social proof.

"bull hypothesis: the office space industry is very large but fragmented. wework becomes the central hub in a worldwide network of tenants and landlords.<p>bear hypothesis: wework is an overhyped-regus with a frail capital structure, no scale or network effects, and dangerous liabilities. it will likely collapse during a recession.<p>questions for investors:<p>1. how much flexibility&#x2F;escapability does wework have regarding leases and liabilities? in particular, how much control do they have over cash flows to avoid disaster during a recession?<p>2. how much does it cost and how long does it take for enterprises like cisco and ibm to open new offices: (1) with wework; (2) with regus or another wework competitor; and (3) without any outside assistance? how about for companies with 100-1000 employees?<p>3. what is the current breakdown, lifetime value, and retention rate for wework members among solos, startups (2-99 employees), mid-sized companies (100-1000 employees), and enterprises (1000+ employees)?<p>4. cashing out $700mm seems like a red flag if you believe the company is worth much more. what percentage of equity does this represent for the founder? is cashing this much out normal for large IPOs? by comparison, how much did zuckerberg, hastings, and bezos cash out at IPO?<p>question for others: what are the first questions you would research on wework?"

"Control&#x2F;ownership&#x2F;structure aside, the interesting line here is:<p>&quot;<i>The financial disclosures make it clear that WeWork — which, it should be said, is a commerce office leasing company and not truly a tech company</i>&quot;<p>Lots of tech companies (eg uber) take VC funded losses to grow at tech startup rates. This can create unsustainable business models and mask sustainability issues. But...<p>..But, in tech, the potential <i>payoff</i> driving all this investment flow is getting to a monopoly (in the Thiel sense). Out of this world business models like Google&#x27;s or FB&#x27;s that generate massive revenue with near-zero marginal costs. Software economics, basically. The winners win incredibly big. This makes the massive-multiple investment case rational.<p>Tesla, WeWork and such have much more normal, non-software-like economics. WeWork will never lease office space for <i>that</i> much above market rates. No matter how good Tesla&#x27;s cars and&#x2F;or manufacturing tech gets, they are never going to sell cars at a 40% margin^. That&#x27;s why Elon had to sell all the Tesla share and take loans. It takes a lot of resources to build factories and cars.

"FTP isn&#x27;t such a good protocol anyways (and there are better programs for accessing FTP than most web browsers); there is Gopher, HTTP(S), Plan9, TFTP, SSH, and other protocols.<p>(I also invented a httpdirlist format (I have been told that httpdirlist is like WebDAV but not as bad; but I don&#x27;t know WebDAV so I cannot say if it is or not). But, sometimes, the other protocols is better than HTTP(S) anyways.)<p>I think it is fine to have them implemented in separate programs, although sometimes you might want to display the result in the browser; one possibility is that the user can configure a program to execute and can configure it to treat the data that program writes to stdout as a HTTP response (possibly with different permissions than normal; it might allow some things that are normally disallowed, and some things that are normally allowed might not work). You might then also want to support other MIME types. You can do this also with external programs; so one configuration option could be to allow treating the program as a filter to convert it into a format the browser understands (e.g. plain text, HTML, PNG, etc; perhaps farbfeld should be supported too, even only for the purpose of these external filters)."

"These sorts of statements always scare me a bit. First,  businesses are still required to give maximum benefit to shareholders.<p>Second, even if this was the goal of a business, it then leaves it up to businesses(boards?, CEOs?) to define things like &quot;ethically&quot;, &quot;important benefits&quot;, &quot;diversity&quot; etc. These aren&#x27;t things you could get all people to agree on in the first place- hence the whole democracy thing we do.

And while he&#x27;s mostly demonized, I have to thank the boss at Infogrames who insisted that Alone in the Dark run on a 286. I didn&#x27;t have a 386 or a 486 when it came out. AitD was my first brush with 3d, and while it did send me back to 2d for a long while just out of mortal terror, I&#x27;ve come around realized that like all art forms, there&#x27;s a time and place for both in the world."
"Just some observations:<p>- In my country, Lithuania, tick-born diseases have been increasingly becoming a major problem. We had them for some time, but I think the problem has been amplified by the climate change in the last few decades. At least, the summers got hotter and the winters certainly start later than they used to in my childhood.<p>- Ironically, cleaner environment and stricter EU regulations on the use of pesticides and other chemical compounds also played a role: tick population is flourishing. The government doesn&#x27;t have or at least cannot come up with some means to control it. Spraying forests with some chemical compounds would certainly produce serious side effects and would do more harm than good (unless something new gets invented). There have been some discussions in the parliament to raise the issue at the EU level.<p>- There are essentially two main diseases: tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) and Lyme disease. They are both very nasty. There is a vaccine from TBE. Unfortunately, vaccination is not universally funded or compensated by the government. Only for certain groups (forest rangers, members of the armed forces, etc). Nevertheless, a lot of people
(including myself) get vaccinated and it&#x27;s one of the most popular vaccines.<p>- Apparently, there is also a vaccine from the Lyme disease: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Lyme_disease#Vaccination"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Lyme_disease#Vaccination</a> .  In 2000s, it was tried in the US, but then subsequently pulled out from the market. It is unclear whether the vaccine really had side effects or it was due to anti-vaxxers.<p>IMO, more effort should be put on: 1) large scale vaccination 2) research on possibilities to control the tick populations."

Something is missing in this conversation.

"Functional programming was a fad and it&#x27;s going out of fashion (again).<p>It gives you rerefential transparency at the expense of  real modularity.<p>Real modularity can only be achieved through proper separation of concerns. The best way to achieve that is by categorizing system state and system logic and allowing chunks of logic to be colocated with the relevant parts of the system state. This is what OOP excels at.<p>With functional programming, you cannot colocate module logic with module state so you often end up with a large monolithic state store on one side of the system and logic which is completely decoupled and sitting on the opposite side of the system... Then the challenge is to apply functions to various relevant parts of the state to transform it in a referentially transparent way.<p>The modularity problem then comes when you need to make a change to the schema&#x2F;structure of the state; whenever you change the structure of the state, you need you need to search through your logic to identify all the parts of the logic which depend on that state and update them to work with the new structure. This is a massive problem and leads to what OOP developers call spaghetti code."

Even if you can&#x27;t fly to Google HQ, continue to think outside the box.

"anecdotal evidence ahead ...<p>I wanted to be a data scientist at a top tech company, so I did as Hanif did, and went to the data on LinkedIn.  my search was more specific - only data scientists at top tech firms, and is also a very tiny sample.<p>But first, my situation at the time:
Masters in Computer Science at the University of Pennsylvania.  strong database, AWS, spark, and python skills.  worked in a social media research lab that looked social media impacts on health, mostly did NLP involving twitter and health outcome data.  Coauthored a paper that ended up in JAMA (journal of american medical association).  Eventually I got what I wanted, but it wasn&#x27;t easy.<p>TLDNR:<p>- message recruiters directly<p>- find a way of showing them you are a good candidate beyond your resume - I found kaggle was really helpful, I recommend it.<p>- be careful of getting pigeonholed out of DS positions by recruiters.  your LinkedIn should speak &#x27;I am a data scientist at heart&#x27;<p>- be prepared to fail interviews and learn from mistakes<p>- study stats (youtube,books), coding (leet code), and SQL (leet code?)<p>Findings:
Degree - Need masters or PHD.  
Major - Statistics or some version of it was most common and MBA&#x27;s at top MBA programs 2nd, Computer Science very rare.  why MBAs? probably because those programs had wonderful stats programs.
School - Top schools are very important.
previous job - Intern at a top tech company.  Intern as a data scientist hugely beneficial.  Next most important feature was whether the previous positions was data scientist.  Not data backed, but I would argue that becoming a data engineer to get adjacent skills is a bad strategy.  DE are highly needed, a recruiter will put you on DE loops, not DS ones.  I feel like data analysts also struggle to become DS.<p>I thought my situation was at least somewhat ideal, but I was not getting interviews.  0. Its hard emotionally to not be able to get to where you want without been giving a chance, just got to keep trying.  Findings helped me realize (previous job) that I was going to need to go about getting interviews in a more efficient manner.<p>I needed a way of getting attention.  the reply rate of websites seems to be 1&#x2F;50, which is problematic if you want to work for a specific set of companies.  I think the best thing to do is to go on LinkedIn, search &lt;company name&gt; + recruiter.  Message the recruiters directly, they have all the power in setting up phone screens, and they send batches of candidates to open positions hoping some of them will get a role.  Now you got their attention, so you also need a way of getting into those batches.<p>An important metric for success was already being what I wanted, so I had to find a way of saying &#x27;I can do this&#x27;.  I starting spending most of my free time on kaggle, the zillow home price prediction.  I finished top 100, which I STRONGLY feel this helped me get interviews.  I recommend it.  Its a free, zero risk way to get experience and display your passion&#x2F;skills.<p>Next, I got some phone screens but failed a few and failed an on site.  Technical phone screens are either stats, coding, or SQL - never been asked ML questions.  Sometimes I failed coding questions, sometimes I failed stat questions.  I addressed this by studying lots of stats (YouTube was very helpful) and coding (leet code).  I already had years of SQL experience, so those questions were always easy for me but be prepared to answer the histogram question.  I had some recruiters tell me in initial phone screen &#x27;even though you applied to a data science position, we think you would be a better match for this data engineering position instead&#x27;.  ouch, I realized my LinkedIn and resume looked very DE like because of my years as a database administrator and I added lots of spark&#x2F;HIVE to my resume because I saw that on most DS postings.  Its important, but don&#x27;t over highlight the wrong things.  I politely declined and kept trying.<p>Eventually I got exactly what I wanted, and I am very happy for it.  It took me 2 years after graduation to get there, and I had failures at all parts of the process.  I know it sounds cliche, but keep trying is my best advice."

"We&#x27;ve had a mostly different (positive) experience doing a similar thing at FullStory for mobile instrumentation, though I think I know where some of the key differences are.<p>Our core &quot;business logic&quot; lives in Rust. This is a shared bit of code between Android &amp; iOS that mainly deals with orchestration, serialization, and server communication. We managed to extract ~1&#x2F;2 of each platform&#x27;s native code into this shared orchestration. What&#x27;s left on each platform is more like a platform driver.<p>I fully admit that things are different for us because we&#x27;re not dealing with a bunch of UI that we manage (instead we&#x27;re dealing with UI that our customers have written in Java&#x2F;Swift&#x2F;Objective-C&#x2F;etc), but I think that there&#x27;s a few places where we&#x27;ve made this work in a better way:<p>- We&#x27;ve chosen flatbuffers to serialize most (not all) of the data between the platform drivers and the shared library.<p>- We&#x27;re using a language that&#x27;s a little more hip. It&#x27;s still not very easy to hire Rust developers, but developers interested in Rust are _very_ interested.<p>- We built tooling early on to make this pretty seamless. Our Rust code builds in XCode and gradle, so there&#x27;s no real friction to a developer getting up and running.<p>Our team is about a year in on this transition to Rust and so far it&#x27;s helped us move far quicker, especially given the size of our team."

Parsing is a minefield in general, but parsing JSON is one of the easiest tasks of all serialization formats. 
It&#x27;s also the only secure format.<p>Its various spec bugs (by omission) are not that dramatic, and the various &quot;enhancements&quot; only made it worse, ie more insecure. Still, bad but not a minefield. What worries me most that my JSON module is the defacto perl standard, passes all these tests, was the very first to add all these tests, is the fastest, and still is not included in that list, just some outdated modules which should not be used at all. 
Checking best practices besides maintaining a spec obviously also is a minefield."

"This is pretty great! I remember building stuff with Flash back when it was still owned by Macromedia. There is a solid level of nostalgia for me there. I know one of the major concerns became security with enabling the Flash player. I assume with WebAssembly as the compile target we don’t really have to worry about it as much?

I know Rust does a lot to resolve memory issues but I’m wondering about the other languages that compile to web assembly.<p>Anyways, nice work!"

It happens everywhere, the biggest pet peeve of mine is that it&#x27;s a normal, accepted practice. For instance, if you don&#x27;t like your boss, you don&#x27;t say anything, you just hold it in and then you send in your resignation. I wish the culture would be more willing to engage in conflict resolution type conversation and learn how to do it. It takes a lot of practice on both sides to do it."

"I am one of the developers of Tridactyl.<p>This dispute is because Tridactyl used to provide a function that users could choose to run that would change two of Firefox&#x27;s settings (the kind you find in about:config). Changing these settings allows addons to run on e.g. addons.mozilla.org and accounts.firefox.org where they otherwise cannot. The change we made is the same change that several blogs had already talked about and suggested.<p>Here is a relevant bugzilla thread that motivated the creation of the blacklist that we turned off, so you can see what Mozilla thinks: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bugzilla.mozilla.org&#x2F;show_bug.cgi?id=1415644"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bugzilla.mozilla.org&#x2F;show_bug.cgi?id=1415644</a><p>A mozilla employee informally asked us to remove this function for security reasons (and we did). Later, an AMO reviewer asked us to change users&#x27; Firefox config automatically to remove these settings. We would rather this were made an explicit choice for Tridactyl users and we&#x27;re trying to negotiate a compromise with the reviewer.<p>This is the only plausible route to exploitation of this situation that I know of, assuming a user acting before we removed the fixamo command:<p>1. You manually install Tridactyl<p>2. You manually install our native messenger<p>3. You manually run a command called `fixamo` or you manually find and install our exemplar RC file that explicitly says at the top that you should read and customise it because it does things you might not like; and then you don&#x27;t read or edit it<p>4. You also manually install a malicious addon<p>5. That malicious addon doesn&#x27;t have permissions for &lt;all_urls&gt; (otherwise it can steal your banking credentials without tridactyl&#x27;s help) but does have permission for accounts.firefox.org<p>6. That addon can then steal your firefox account credentials and use them to e.g. mess with your synced settings and e.g. download your passwords database (if you don&#x27;t have a master password set).<p>My view is that you&#x27;re pretty much fucked if you install a malicious addon with &lt;all_urls&gt; anyway (and many addons request that permission), so this slight extra capability you get if you successfully phish someone in this pool of &lt;1000 people isn&#x27;t a big deal.<p>---<p>Some people have opined that our documentation for the command was not explicit enough. My opinion is that it&#x27;s good enough and about on par with other resources that talked about the same settings. It would be better if it was more explicit about the security risks, but we provided fairly complete information about what we were doing and a link to the source code.<p>This is the documentation we provided:<p>In the &quot;Webextension caveats&quot; section:<p>&quot;To make Tridactyl work on addons.mozilla.org and some other Mozilla domains, you need to open about:config, run fixamo or add a new boolean privacy.resistFingerprinting.block_mozAddonManager with the value true, and remove the above domains from extensions.webextensions.restrictedDomains.&quot;<p>In the docstring for fixamo, partially displayed if you type fixamo in the commandline and also included in the help pages we encourage users to use with e.g. `:h fixamo`:<p>&quot;Simply sets<p>&quot;privacy.resistFingerprinting.block_mozAddonManager&quot;:true &quot;extensions.webextensions.restrictedDomains&quot;:&quot;&quot;<p>in about:config via user.js so that Tridactyl (and other extensions!) can be used on addons.mozilla.org and other sites.&quot;<p>You can find these messages in src&#x2F;excmds.ts at commit 92e1b005c47995e3d24f61a7d4c3935df8437f1a<p>We also included a variant of the fixamo command in the exemplar .tridactylrc file (not used unless you have also installed the native messenger and also explicitly found, downloaded and installed the exemplar). This file includes this text at the top:<p>&quot;Provided only as an example.<p>Do not install&#x2F;run without reading through as you may be surprised by some of the settings.&quot;<p>And this text right above the fixamo line:<p>&quot;Make Tridactyl work on more sites at the expense of some security&quot;"

After a week I went to the doctor and Lyme came back negative. Another week passed and he gave me an antibiotic and it cleared up in a few days. It may have been psychosomatic but I have never experienced anything like it before or since. The mark on my ankle has taken almost three years to heal."

"The product owner perspective on this should be &quot;nothing supports anything unless it is tested&quot;.<p>If you pick up a standard and just assume other products will be able to work with it, you&#x27;re in for a surprise. I don&#x27;t care if it&#x27;s TCP sockets or .ini files; if you didn&#x27;t test compatibility with the product you expect will interact with yours through the standard, consider it unstable, and don&#x27;t advertise support for it.<p>Sometimes you <i>have</i> to support a standard itself, like WPA2, so you implement the standard according to internet engineering best practice: be liberal with what you accept, and conservative with what you transmit (or something to that effect).

For one, it makes it a lot easier to write integration tests using a “golden file” of ideal output, because your program that outputs JSON now usually deterministically has one correct output. For two, it lets you hash a json-encoded object deterministically."

"The OpenAI approach to managing the release of the larger dataset strikes me as totally flawed and upside down. The biggest concern the team seem to have is that the fully trained GPT2 model will be used to spread propaganda and misinformation. They also imply that the biggest hurdle to training a similar model is money needed to pay for the training resources.<p>The problem with this approach is that the users most likely to be malicious users of GPT2 are state actors. China, for example, <i>already</i> spends millions on an immense propaganda factory. Money is not a serious obstacle for a state. Given that other research entities are, by the sound of things, already far along with development of similar models it seems unlikely that China and the US don&#x27;t already have functional models internally.<p>On the other hand, legitimate business and research is clearly hamstrung by withholding the full model. What we have is the maximum degree of inconvenience and the minimum degree of security. It feels almost perfectly analogous to ban on liquids in airports. The motivation for that ban was that existing security measures couldn&#x27;t detect liquids, but simply announcing a ban was to be enforced didn&#x27;t change the fact that liquids were undetectable. Instead millions of travelers were pointlessly inconvenienced at great cost.<p>Release the kraken already!"

Early morning is best, as your mind is fresh and not as distracted.<p>2) Find a quiet&#x2F;non-distracting place to sit in a comfortable position.  Legs crossed on the floor or in a chair are fine.  You want to keep your back straight to help keep from falling asleep.<p>3) Focus on the sensation of your breath, wherever it is strongest.

Your mind will become distracted with work, worries, thoughts of food, etc.  When this happens, congratulate yourself on noticing that it happened, and bring your attention back to your breath.<p>That&#x27;s it!

You need a source of trust in these systems. Journals used to have that role. They had high standards that were upheld by editors selecting only worthy publications. Today it seems that many journals aren&#x27;t as trustworthy as they seemed to be in the past. It&#x27;s also easier to spam the journals with your publication and to bullshit your way into publication. The incentives to publish a lot are also way higher now that your grant money is highly dependent on your citation count. Journals can publish more and easier and lower the standards for submission to earn more money. The system is basically eating itself and we haven&#x27;t found a cure yet.<p>Filtering for self-citations is useful to identify the bubbles. But it is not sufficient to determine if those bubbles only contain hot air or if these scientists are actually working on something with substance in a narrow field where few others publish.

"&gt; Gawel and his collaborators have now created and imaged the long-sought ring molecule carbon-18. Using standard ‘wet’ chemistry, his collaborator Lorel Scriven, an Oxford chemist, first synthesized molecules that included four-carbon squares coming off the ring with oxygen atoms attached to squares. The team then sent their samples to IBM laboratories in Zurich, Switzerland, where collaborators put the oxygen–carbon molecules on a layer of sodium chloride, inside a high-vacuum chamber. They manipulated the rings one at a time with electric currents (using an atomic-force microscope that can also act as a scanning-transmission microscope), to remove the extraneous, oxygen-containing parts. After much trial-and-error, micrograph scans revealed the 18-carbon structure. “I never thought I would see this,” says Scriven.<p>The molecule (an all-carbon cycle of 18 atoms) was prepared in a very unusual way - by directly manipulating the atoms using an atomic force microscope.<p>In other words, each molecule is made individually. This is not the way that chemists typically work, and will not result in quantities of material that can be seen.<p>The abstract says nothing about chemical stability, but I suspect C-18 quite unstable and may never be prepared in gram quantities.<p>Higher cycles containing more carbons may be more stable, but this is likely to remain a curiosity for some time.<p>Still, this is a new kind of &quot;allotrope&quot; of carbon. The cyclic, relatively rigid nature of the structure and the potential for electrons to circulate under applied fields could lead to some unusual applications."

"This piece has the feeling of being written by &quot;every Friday is Hawaiian T-shirt day&quot; after his employer went all remote and he needed a new task.<p>I have worked remotely more than not and it&#x27;s not ideal. I suspect that if teleportation machines existed, then remote work wouldn&#x27;t be a thing. Once you leave the office for the day (or leave the house to go to the office) then the logistical problems start (where do I find an affordable place to live.) Logistical problems for employees become logistical issues for employers. Working remotely is a trade-off and much of the time it works well enough.<p>I&#x27;m guessing that most early remote workers get relatively cushy setups with allowances for equipment and good salaries. As remote becomes more common, then I bet that gets squeezed. Employers shouldn&#x27;t expect that the average person can make it work. If you don&#x27;t have a dedicated quiet office area then it gets real difficult. Pets are a distraction. Other people in the home are a distraction (and it&#x27;s not their fault, they have the right to &quot;be at home&quot;.) If you have a significant other living at home full time and that person is in a grumpy mood, then good luck.<p>I feel that people who can make it work are those who either live in a cave with no other living creatures or they have the bread to get a big enough house and funds to create an operations center in a dedicated room. Everyone else should at least get a desk at a co-working space.<p>There&#x27;s also a lot which gets lost in the communication of remote working. The communication you do have is much more mercenary. A group of special operators can carry out a mission together and even do so with mostly radio silence. But these people lose out of a lot of the more interesting elements of civilian life. Alice is an avatar and emoji&#x27;s who can get stuff done in remote space. But you don&#x27;t get to see her world class key short-cut skills from which you could open up a whole new way of thinking about your own operations. You don&#x27;t see the real pressure your boss or manager is under and you get far less information about how things work because they won&#x27;t be casually confiding in you at the water cooler. You don&#x27;t need a NORAD display to show major events and weather conditions around the world to see what challenges your collaborators will be up against in getting things done the coming day.<p>Remote work kind of sucks. Where do I take the survey? ;)"

"Reading the actual study [1], the headline is a bit deceptive. The study looked at audits between 2000 and 2010, a period during which funding to the IRS increased, and found that generally more funding for audits led to more money recovered from audits (duh). But that $34.3B figure is over 10 years, so it&#x27;s a tiny fraction of a percent of overall federal revenue, and it&#x27;s not offset by the amount of more money the IRS would have taken to run those audits.<p>Also unmentioned is the very real negative externalities that IRS audits cause. Audits disproportionately affect poor people [2], who are also the least able to spend time dealing with them. The United States already has extremely low tax evasion rates [3]. Rather than spending money to catch more of the very few cheaters by audits, other country&#x27;s tax authorities have found &quot;nudge&quot; letters were found to be similarly effective and vastly cheaper.<p>[1] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.aaajournals.org&#x2F;doi&#x2F;abs&#x2F;10.2308&#x2F;accr-52520?utm_source=15-kelley-research-on-irs-budget-cuts&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=How+do+IRS+resources+affect+the+corporate+audit+process?&amp;utm_campaign=ag"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.aaajournals.org&#x2F;doi&#x2F;abs&#x2F;10.2308&#x2F;accr-52520?utm_s...</a><p>[2] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;projects.propublica.org&#x2F;graphics&#x2F;eitc-audit"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;projects.propublica.org&#x2F;graphics&#x2F;eitc-audit</a><p>[3] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.researchgate.net&#x2F;figure&#x2F;Size-and-development-of-tax-evasion-in-of-GDP-in-38-OECD-countries-accounting-for_tbl2_256040463"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.researchgate.net&#x2F;figure&#x2F;Size-and-development-of-...</a>"

"There is something I cannot understand and this has already become a cliche:
&gt; Technology industry is an extremely fast-moving one. Many technologies used today didn&#x27;t even exist&#x2F;were popular a decade ago; in 2009, mobile app development and blockchain were pretty much unheard of. Engineers constantly need to upgrade their skills to stay relevant to the demands of the job market. Engineering is a great career for passionate individuals who like to learn.<p>Why would anyone give this advice? Can we stop handing out this advice and encourage everyone to stand up for their rights instead? If you think about it, by proxy this gives you the following advice: as a programmer you will have no life outside of work and you are supposed to be an idiot who spends his time working and studying outside office hours even when you could spend time with your family. So yeah, go for it and suck it up you idiot.<p>At least that&#x27;s how most employers handle this problem. And interestingly by comparison no-one tells a MBA diploma holder that it&#x27;s a great career for passionate individuals who like to spend their whole life studying.<p>And before you think that I am against studying, that&#x27;s not the case at all. If my company pays for it and I can kick back on a sofa during working hours to study I am fine with it. But I cannot see any value studying something on my own expense on my own time which will be outdated in 3 years anyway and so by definition it only benefits my employer."

"&gt; Epic Aerospace: Epic is manufacturing inexpensive space tugs to deliver satellites into geostationary orbit. The 21-year-old founder has been building rockets since he was 16, and is now managing a team of seven aerospace engineers with Epic Aerospace. The founder describes propulsion as one of the biggest problems for satellite companies, in that it can take up to two years to qualify new satellite systems and can cost up to $30 million. The problem they’re solving is moving satellites from low Earth orbit directly into geostationary orbit. Epic’s tug is half the cost of the competition and is reusable. They’re currently working with Satellogic, and chasing what the founder says is a $3.1 billion geostationary insertion market.<p>So, uh... what&#x27;s the big propulsion breakthrough?

"Something that blew my mind the first time I learned it:<p>You can think of a function f(x) as the limit of an infinitely big vector where the entries index the infinitesimal. Eg f(x) = [...f(-2<i>dx), f(-dx), f(0), f(dx), f(2</i>dx)...]. The dot product of two functions (f,g) is still the usual sum[f(x)*g(x)] but the sum is replaced with an integral. Sin and Cos of integer frequencies happen to have a dot product of 0 (check it) which means doing a change of basis into those functions (aka the Fourier transform) happens to work out really nicely. Other than that Sin and Cos are not really privileged. For example you can do a transform into the basis of polynomial functions if you wanted to (aka the Taylor series). Any basis you can cook up would do just as well so long as its a complete basis. Just like in linear algebra, you have a complete basis if you can use linear combinations to construct the vectors ... [...1,0,0...], [...0,1,0...], [...0,0,1...] ... (aka the dirac delta functions). Differentiation is a matrix with dx on the off diagonal and -dx on the diagonal."

"I’m primarily a React &#x2F; Node dev, but I’ve been thinking about picking up another language and framework for a while. I feel like Node &#x2F; Express is great, but I also sometimes feel like it’s not a proper framework, in that you end up assembling a lot of code by hand (ex: auth, data modeling) and after a few projects it’s tedious. Also, Node only offers concurrency as an unnatural afterthought...<p>I’ve dabbled in Django and it seems to solve some of those problems, but I also feel like web programming in an OO dynamic scripting language isn’t that far away from doing it in JS so I might as well learn something mind-blowingly new...<p>I’ve been exposed to functional programming in OCaml in a rigorous college course and absolutely loved it, how would you guys rate learning Phoenix + Elixir in my case?"

"I hesitate to wade into this, since I have a lot of admiration for these two men, and I am only a mediocre speaker of Pulaar, the western dialect spoken by Fulani, whose eastern dialect is Fulfulde. I have seen several variations of this story making the rounds over the last few years, and it is full of misconceptions about the Fulani communities across the Sahel, and more generally about linguistics (and language politics) of trans-national communities. It is unfortunate that in this particular article Microsoft repeats many of the errors of the Atlantic[1], and the Letterform Archive [2], and adds its own self-congratulatory spin to it.<p>The first misconception is that Pulaar&#x2F;Fulfulde is&#x2F;was rarely written. Despite the experiences of the Barry brothers, the language has been written for hundreds of years. There are manuscripts  in Arabic script that attest to this - unfortunately these are generally poorly catalogued, but BU&#x27;s African Ajami Library lists 25 [3] and the British Library has several collections [4]. There is a strong historical argument that the Fulani were actually the primary instigators of literacy in pre-colonial West Africa, from the 15th and 16th centuries. The practice of writing Pulaar&#x2F;Fulfulde with Arabic script did without question wane in the 20th c. - particularly among the more educated and urban communities which the Barry brothers come from. This led to decreased standardisation of the language as written in the Arabic script, especially as Fulani communities came to have stronger ties to national identities than to their transnational identity as Fulani. At the same time, the general push for literacy in languages written with Latin script in the region (mostly French and English) led to a loss in language prestige for Pulaar&#x2F;Fulfulde as it had less utility as a lingua franca, and was not the language of religion, trade or politics, in the way it had been.<p>By the 1990&#x27;s, however there was substantial linguistic work done on Pulaar&#x2F;Fulfulde and a modified Latin alphabet was widely in use in the linguistic and academic community, which is currently seen on almost all Wikipedia articles on the subject. This is marked by &#x27;hooked&#x27; letters for plosives, as in Fulɓe, which this Microsoft article writes &quot;Fulbhe.&quot; The fact that this was not widely enough known that the Barry brothers came across it before developing a new standard for writing is testament to the fragmentation within the Fulani community, but I think it also reflects the fact that they did not come at the issue from a linguistics background. Nonetheless, this pre-existing writing standard does accurately represent all of the sounds in Pulaar&#x2F;Fulfulde (and also is not much different from many other African languages in the region written with a Latin alphabet). It also was used for printing a number of books in the early 2000s, and I knew of a handful of companies regularly printing books in Pulaar in Dakar, Senegal (where it is also a minority language). I once picked up an order for 10,000 books printed in Pulaar in 2005, typeset in this commonly accepted script adapted from the Latin Alphabet.<p>The second major misconception of the article, is that a language needs to have its own script to be accurately represented, or that having its own script enhances the literacy rate of a language. Other comments have touched on this, so I won&#x27;t dwell, but from a linguistic perspective (or even from a software language perspective) the opposite is more likely to be the case. The answer to the proliferation of different standards should almost never be to create a new standard - especially one that is not at all based on the previous standards (as Adlam is based on neither Arabic or Latin abjads&#x2F;alphabets). Literacy in Pulaar&#x2F;Fulfulde is almost certainly better served by doubling down on an existing standard that is accessible to those who most want to access it, rather than a new standard. There are 100-150 million Pulaar&#x2F;Fulfulde speakers, so even success in the range of thousands of Fulani who recognise Adlam doesn&#x27;t mean it is likely to overtake the actual pragmatic literacy of those hundreds of millions who already ready on a daily basis in Latin scripts, and could easily recognise the adapted letters.<p>From a political perspective, there might be a value in a new unifying standard that underscores the uniqueness of Fulɓe from their neighbours in Mauritania to Sudan. But in every one of those countries, the Fulɓe are a minority, and many of their communities are nomadic&#x2F;transhumant as well, further undermining their ability to integrate or oppose existing political structures. While I applaud Adlam as a commendable assertion of identity, and a valuable potential contribution to the linguistics and typography of West African languages (should it engage constructively with the field), it is politically doomed, and unfortunately lends credence to the dictum that &quot;a language is a dialect with an army.&quot;<p>Pulaar&#x2F;Fulfulde is an incredibly important language, but it hasn&#x27;t had an army since the fall of the Empire of Sokoto in 1903 to colonial powers. It has largely been seen as a dialect because of that, despite being one of the most widely spoken in Africa (Swahili is the only other African language with a claim to have more than 100 million native speakers).<p>[1] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theatlantic.com&#x2F;technology&#x2F;archive&#x2F;2016&#x2F;11&#x2F;the-alphabet-that-will-save-a-people-from-disappearing&#x2F;506987&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theatlantic.com&#x2F;technology&#x2F;archive&#x2F;2016&#x2F;11&#x2F;the-a...</a>

"When I picked up a DVCS years ago I initially went for Mercurial for its ease of use. It had a clean command line interface and it just clicked with me (Git still had some bits written in Perl).

Its hgweb worked without fuss on top of Apache (which was still popular). Bitbucket was a small time site back then (about 2008) and I mainly hosted the projects locally on a web server.<p>However the industry has voted by putting its weight behind Git and Git has won. It has caught up usability-wise. Its performance is miles ahead of Mercurial.

The statement says CEO can do actions that can be harmful to stock, but still do it for the benefit of customers and employees, because they believe in it is good for the long term and us economic as whole.

"Encarta was part of my first job out of university. I worked in Microsoft&#x27;s Multimedia Division, tasked with creating the first video and audio drivers for Windows. IIRC the BMP, WAV, and AVI file formats all came from this team at about this time.<p>In the summer of &#x27;91, I was tasked with assembling a 386 PC with an early CD-ROM drive to demo an early build of Encarta at a trade show. It was a lot of effort to find a combination of hardware and drivers that would work reliably together.<p>Encarta itself (at least at that time) was written as a Word document. Hyperlinks were defined using footnotes, and animation and audio placeholders were defined with custom OLE objects. The whole thing got exported as RTF and fed to a compiler, which created the runtime data structures optimized for CD-ROM access and that also built a full-text search index. The compilation was very slow and required huge amounts of RAM.<p>Around this time, the team had some awareness of HTML as one of many emerging hypertext markup languages, but the internet was still a few years away and no one knew what format would &quot;win&quot; for hypertext. In any case, there were no tools or browsers at all, so we had to build everything -- including our own search engine for the CD-ROM."

"They might make up for their electricity bill 1:1 but they&#x27;ll never go neutral on the amount of carbon wealth they consume in payment for their services.<p>Imagine I have a business where I busk for money with my guitar outside of a coal plant and a single coal minor is my patron. I may be &quot;carbon neutral&quot; but in fact I owe my whole existence to coal being mined and burnt. Coal is my life blood and the sole source of wealth in my life. I may as well mine the coal myself and play guitar for myself, and if you consider me and the miner to be a unit it&#x27;s obvious the two of us are living on coal and the fact that he does all the work while I play guitar hardly means anything.<p>Companies like stripe are sufficiently separated from coal and oil that they can believe they don&#x27;t suck at the teat of fossil fuels, and that the only coal wealth they consume is whatever powers their light bulbs and servers. But ultimately you can track back the wealth that comes their way - all of it - to operations that generate quite a bit more emissions.<p>We can run subsidies and credits in little isolated corners of our economy, but it&#x27;s like running a refrigerator in a closed room. Ultimately you&#x27;re just burning wealth which creates a greater load on the wealth-generating machine that is the fossil fuel industry.<p>Real advances that make it possible to generate wealth without fossil fuel money in subsidies should be celebrated. These tech guys taking $1m of their $100m in profits (the coal miner pays the busker using stripe) to pay their $1m light bill is a shell game"

It also kills me when I see ML models who need stationarity assumptions applied to non-stationary time series data. Yeah, good luck with that.<p>THAT being said, there is lots of high quality research which has been replicated over and over, showing that alpha does exist in the market (and which funds have made billions off of).

Other than studying for spelling quizzes, there has been no homework from Kindergarten through grade 3.<p>I regularly see kids at the mall or hanging out in parks.

"Unfortunately in C++, the compiler is not allowed to assume that if it passes a const reference to a function, that function will not change the object.  The function is allowed to cast away const and modify the object.  I&#x27;m not happy that they did it that way; I would have preferred it if cast-away-const were more restricted (for example, allowed when calling a child function that takes a char* but doesn&#x27;t modify the pointed-to C string), with the idea being that if a function has only a pointer to const or a reference for a const object, it has read permission on the object and lacks write permission.  But that isn&#x27;t how the language works."

"A brief tangent, but something I&#x27;ve noticed is that the meanings of words like &quot;fluent&quot; and even &quot;native&quot; are so ambiguous and poorly defined, that it is almost impossible to have a meaningful conversation about language learning unless you avoid them completely.<p>The marketing materials for language learning resources tend to make full use of this vagueness, like this one does. I wish these resources instead did more to enlighten their prospects as to what one can actually expect to achieve and in what kind of time frames.<p>Languages are endlessly deep. &quot;Native&quot; is not even close to the top. Even amongst &quot;native&quot; speakers, skill with and understanding of language is enormously varied. Compare the wedding toast of a skilled public speaker with that of an average one. Compare a literature scholar&#x27;s understanding of a classic novel with that of an ordinary high school graduate. It&#x27;s night and day.<p>IME, 777 kanji wouldn&#x27;t get you very far in a newspaper and certainly not a novel.

"&gt; Raynal’s lifestyle was becoming so unbalanced that his family was beginning to worry about him. One day, he ran out of his room in a panic, telling them that all of the color had bled out of his vision. His mother bustled him off to an ophthalmologist, who told him he appeared to have disrupted the photoreceptors in his eyes by staring so long at a monitor screen. Thankfully, the condition persisted only a few hours. But then there came a day when he suddenly couldn’t understand anything that was said to him; he had apparently become so attuned to the language of computer code that he could no longer communicate with humans. That worrisome condition lasted several weeks.<p>This sounds hard to believe. A lot more people use computers nowadays, for equally long periods of time if not more, and neither of these symptoms seem to be a thing. So... what&#x27;s going on here?

"Encarta is a great example of Microsoft winning a market, and after it was defeated, letting it fade out.

There was a lot of back-room wheeling and dealing around digital encyclopedias during that era, much of it centered around Encarta—Microsoft acquired a lot of publishers during that period and it effectively disrupted most of the rest out of existence.<p>But even considering that, Encarta was special. I think Microsoft had the right idea—it was the killer app for CD-ROMs—though it turned out that the internet would only make it a temporary success story.<p>It didn’t have to be like that, honestly. Imagine what might have happened if, for example, Microsoft worked more closely with the Wikimedia Foundation on the highly visual treatments the company was known for with Encarta. The nonprofit ownership was a good move, but the fact that MS seemed to cede the market entirely, especially so soon after disrupting the whole thing, was unfortunate."

"My father is from a generation where, from the day he got hired to the day he retired, 45 years later, he worked for the same employer.  That changed in the 1990s.<p>That changed in the 1990s because companies no longer valued long term commitments.  The famous example is IBM laying off, in bulk, countless long-term employees in the interest of increasing their bottom line.<p>The only way I was able to get a pay raise in the tech industry was by changing jobs.  Once I figured that out, I changed jobs about once a year to triple my salary.  On the way of doing this to climb the corporate ladder, I saw a lot of unethical behavior:<p>I saw countless dot-com startups dissolve after all of the executives gave themselves as big of a golden parachute as possible; I had consultants tell me to put experience I never did on my resume; I saw a company closing shop without paying their employees their final paycheck; I saw (and still sometimes see) hucksters promising good work and “exposure” but saying they could not pay you “for the time being”; I see companies demanding extensive experience (the infamous “ten years of React” job posting -- keep in mind React has been around for under seven years) but never offering on-the-job training; I have seen people who have developed injury or disabilities interfering with their work being “laid off” without warning; I have seen big tech companies refusing to hire anyone outright and cut off contracts short in the interest of maximizing CEO pay and shareholder value.<p>In short, I have become cynical about the tech industry and how it treats employees.  Sure, it’s a living wage, but they won’t hire you if you mention “work life balance” during the interview; they expect long hours from their employees and expect the company to become their passion or life.  No wonder why fewer people in America decide to give birth to and raise kids; it’s just not possible with the insane hours tech companies expect from their employees.<p>Yes, I’ve become quite cynical about the tech industry.  It chews up workers and spit them out.  The happiest memories of my life are not being in some cubicle in some office making too much money, but the times in my life when I took a break from tech and supported myself as an English teacher in another country, and had time to actually make real world friends and be able to date normally.  Those are the times I cherish; that and the time I spend with my beautiful daughter."

Except when the difference is, in fact, fundamental.<p>Back doors have a way of becoming front doors for the wrong people. And absolute power corrupts absolutely.<p>All of that was true before.

"It talks about Google Search and the Google tools pointed to are good at telling you how Google search will react.

I.e, simply just copy some existing product or solution, with a known market.<p>The entrepreneurship scene preaches originality and novel idea to hopeful founders, but to me, it always ends up with a race for who can do something better than their competitor.<p>I&#x27;ve noticed that in many countries outside US, especially western Europe, some of the largest startups are those that play-by-play copy successful US startups, probably hoping to get acquired once the US startups start expanding to said countries."

"Difficult credit repair .<p>June 16th, 2017 Without reservation I heartily endorse Raymond Harleysville and his associates at South Creditrebuild Advisory for any business or personal credit repair problems. I am very impressed by Raymond’s methodical devotion to him very unique skill set. Raymond knows more about genuine and ethical and highly effective credit repair methodologies than any other credit professional in my underwriting association for commercial loans. Myself and my family are very grateful to have done business with him and his company. Please do not hesitate to contact him for any point of information in regards to this excellent credit repair process . I have been heavily involved as the founder and owner of a successful loan brokerage in the professional credit markets, including residential mortgages and commercial lending since 1986. Consumer and commercial Credit analysis and improvement has been a daily skill set mandatory for our business to succeed. I am writing to commend Raymond Harleysville and his associates at North Creditrebuild Advisory for an exceptional job in deleting a nasty disputed account with a stubborn and relentless cell phone creditor, Verizon from my wife’s personal credit profile. Suffice it to say I have seen and dealt with many firms claiming to be so called experts at ‘credit repair.’. Most are frauds in my experience. They charge a large fee to simply mail out credit disputes to the 3 bureaus Experian, Trans Union and Equifax and then charge another fee to do the exact same process again when it fails a few months later. The dispute mill process of endless disputes does not work in permanently removing negative credit reporting, even when the disputes are for a provable situation that you can document. Removing negative credit is an art form. The process that Raymond Harleysville and North Creditrebuild  utilizes is proprietary and unlike produces results that are in my case spectacular. The untold hours I have spent with Verizon disputing an unjust $3,500. Bill were so severe that my wife wanted me to just pay it to get rid of the headache. But I wanted to do what was right. We did not owe the money so we hired Raymond.   Again, him secret methodology for removing this potentially lethal late mark on our credit is him alone. I do not know how he removed the negative account but we got a letter from Verizon that said that we were never late and that our balance was $0.00! I almost fell out of my chair! Since the late Verizon mark has been deleted from our credit our scores jumped almost 120 points almost overnight. Our credit limits on our credit cards have been increased by $30,000. We just qualified for a new 2017 V Sport XTS Platinum Twin Turbo Cadillac for $94,000, at 2% interest. If you need him to work for you reach him at raycreditrebuild AT GMAIL DOT COM."

"When I was writing software for medical devices in the &#x27;90s, we had a very clear policies for dealing with cognitive drift that included performance ceilings, testing for drift in beta testing, etc.  In our testing, 10 seconds was the absolute maximum time that a surgeon could &quot;idle&quot; and stay on task in surgery.<p>In addition, we found that including spinners, progress bars, etc. would not necessarily reduce the cognitive drift but would reduce emotional frustration.<p>The worst thing for frustration was UI elements being slow; buttons that responded slowly, scrolls that lag, pull-downs that didn&#x27;t pull down.  Exactly as this author notes.  There was very little tolerance for those kinds of delays.<p>I presume that, like website response rate tolerance thresholds that have dropped from 5 seconds to less than 2 seconds now, the medical industry is probably using much lower times now."
"I don&#x27;t remember Encarta but we had Sierra&#x27;s Britannica and then later another (can&#x27;t recall the name).

There is something there in the  limited scope that developed a persistence in me. If I was going to understand the transistor and build a toy radio, I had to understand THAT article and the few others I might find in a real encyclopedia around the house or maybe an article I got online. I wonder how my children might develop such persistence with information availability we now enjoy?"

"Considering that Google (search) still lists plenty of FTP results, many of which have been <i>extremely</i> useful to me, this seems like another move to bully the Internet into what Google wants it to be.

In other words, performance that doesn&#x27;t show up in the user&#x27;s experience, because something else is the main delay.<p>Now, if all that meant was that the programmer has to do some more work, and you aren&#x27;t worried about paying more for the software, this may not matter, but that is far from the only (or even most important) result of optimizing everything for performance.  Instead, what you get is code that is much longer, and more complex, and therefore harder to update, and more likely to be buggy.<p>For example, one common thing you have to do to get performance, is to cache values in multiple places, instead of looking them up every time.  This can result in big improvements to software performance if done in the places which are the current limiting step, but now you have to make sure you invalidate the cache correctly.  In particular, if you don&#x27;t, you get stale values in the cache, which is to say false data.<p>If you make a system with cacheing all over the place, it will be very hard to make changes correctly, which means sometimes they will get made incorrectly.  In mission-critical systems, this is even less acceptable than elsewhere.<p>It&#x27;s not just &quot;I don&#x27;t feel like optimizing&quot;.  More often, it&#x27;s the cost of optimizing is not worth the benefit, for this particular part of the code.  How do you know what spots in the code it&#x27;s worth it?  You don&#x27;t optimize, at first, and then see which two or three spots in the system are rate-limiting."
"Best survey of the subject I have found (most are bullshit) is  Finding Alpha by Eric Falkenstein which he has graciously offered for free on his blog. By the subject I mean, finding an edge in trading. Spoiler alert there is no system to follow. He wrote algos for a local options market maker, had a significant Econ PHD thesis. The basic premise of the book is that real Alpha is rare, idiosyncratic and gets exploited by those in the know and eventually the edge goes away after several years. He gives several classic historic examples which are what made this book so interesting and unique to me.

&gt;  IRS is auditing fewer tax returns from corporations because it has fewer people and resources available to identify potential errors and follow up on questionable tax returns<p>On one hand I do want businesses to pay their fair share. On the other hand I don&#x27;t want to encourage massive tax agencies which must justify their numbers by auditing and harassing as many people as possible. Often small businesses that don&#x27;t have to resources to defend themselves like large corporations. Very similar to police departments who justify their existence by writing tickets and have quotas set up to encourage cops to harass people. Does not seem much more than a shakedown.

"Depressed kids are a symptom of a sick society and bleak outlooks. You have to try really hard to point a finger at a single culprit, but we all know that&#x27;s just not the case. Sure, play is one important factor but let&#x27;s consider for a moment some additional points to connect for a bleak picture:<p>1. We <i>purposely</i> build addiction into social media which leads to more screen time. Anecdotally, there are so many examples of people quitting social media and feeling much better. Screen time is a huge factor for sure.<p>2. We put undo stress on our kids with all of the testing requirements.I remember how much anxiety and stress I got in school just thinking about the upcoming test. Now test frequency is completely insane when compared to when I was in school. I can only imagine how much stress this is adding to a kid&#x27;s day. So yeah, I think testing plays a big role in this too.<p>3. Kids (teens), are constantly exposed to the fear-mongering headlines bombarding them day in day out. Since we set up our media to profit from pageviews, we&#x27;ve created a situation where it pays to play up to people&#x27;s fears. Kids read these things too and in many cases do not have the mental models or capacity to differentiate clickbait bs. vs substantive information. Hell, even adults (as witnessed by at least 50% of US population) can&#x27;t differentiate between fact and fiction.<p>4. Lack of play time. OF COURSE kids are not going to develop properly if they can&#x27;t learn to socialize and participate in society. OF COURSE they&#x27;ll distance themselves back into the screen where, OOPS, they&#x27;ll read more of those nasty headlines and while at it think about the upcoming test. It doesn&#x27;t help that we now have (billion?)-dollar gaming companies pulling every trick in the book to build addiction into every interaction. What better way to escape the problems of the real world than to retrieve into the virtual one? I can&#x27;t blame them... this is what I personally did as a teen.<p>5. Climate change - probably one of the most understated reasons that leaves children hopeless. While we keep debating on the best ways to solve our climate problems, kids are left hopeless about their futures. We have grown ass adults taking to Twitter to insult teens for trying to take some sort of action while those same grown ass adults are sitting on their hands or swiping their facebook feeds.<p>6. Increased hopelessness, depression and isolation among adults - how are kids supposed to learn to explore on their own and that there is more to life than your screen when their parents are increasingly isolating themselves from the world. When you have a government that is hellbent on making your life more difficult by fueling inequality, what possible hope do you have as a child when you see how your parents struggle to make ends meet? &quot;oh so this is what I have to look forward to...&quot;<p>You could pick apart any one of those points to trace the origins and have enough to write a Times essay. The point being, it&#x27;s one massive clusterfuck with multiple points of failure. If we want our kids to have any sort of a decent and bright future full of joy, we should start looking at how to fix our own problems. Start looking at reducing inequality, proactive automation readiness, better social systems, fewer guns, policies to reduce consumption, subsidies for alternative energies and de-carbonization, complete education reform to do away with insane testing, strict laws on what can and cannot make it into consumer apps in terms of addiction building, and so on and so on."

"It&#x27;s fun to read older business books like Built to Last and Good to Great that use the &quot;let&#x27;s study successful businesses to see what they do&quot; methodology.

Study successful people and emulate them. Of course! How could we go wrong?<p>Nevermind that the successful people are more likely to just be lucky or even just plain wrong about the reasons for their success.<p>I attribute my success to hard work, getting up early, making steady progress every day, picking great people to work with, and staying ahead of the curve. Sounds great, right? But to really know if any of that matters, we have to study a large number of people who also profess to do exactly those things and see if they&#x27;re way more successful than average. If they&#x27;re not...well then I&#x27;m just wrong about the reasons for my own success and other factors are more important.<p>It doesn&#x27;t sell books though when your message is &quot;in order to be successful you have to be naturally smart, tall, and attractive, work about as hard as everyone else, and be well-connected and lucky.&quot;"

"This seems to be comparing a hand implemented neural network in python (and numpy) and one in rust.

"I have three school age kids and I&#x27;d put the difficulties of modern parenting into two bins:<p>1.

"I want to like J, but I find that most of my programs get too cluttered with @: all over the place. I see the k-means example shown here has a similar problem (7 usages of @: in only 4 lines of J). I find implicit programming a more elegant paradigm, but lambdas with pre-declared argument names (like x,y,z in k or α and ω in Dyalog APL) more comfortable to work with (and, at least for the time being, more productive).<p>I think part of the reason is that J&#x27;s syntax for function composition is too heavy. In an improved visualization of J like the one shown here, I would find very interesting to try something like, for example, composition by simple juxtaposition and trains with under(or over)lining, maybe even playing with colors to indicate if verbs form a train or other composition. I understand that is a quite different problem from just substituting @: with o̲.<p>Nevertheless, very nice work. It is interesting to see the English and APL versions next to each other.

"&gt; Software has characteristics that make it hard to build with traditional management techniques<p>Perhaps some software development techniques would work though...<p>&gt;  The main value in software is not the code produced, but the knowledge accumulated by the people who produced it.<p>Those people go on to work on other things or for other organization. So, while that statement might have some truth to it, it&#x27;s still the case that the code has to be useful, robust, and able to impart knowledge to those who read it (and the documentation).<p>&gt; Start as Simple as Possible<p>That&#x27;s a solid suggestion to many (most?) software projects; but - if your goal is to write something comprehensive and flexible, you may need to replace it with:<p>&quot;Start by simplifying your implementation objectives as much as possible&quot;<p>and it&#x27;s even sometimes the case that you want to sort of do the opposite, i.e.<p>&quot;Start as complex as possible, leading you to immediately avoid the complex specifics in favor of a powerful generalization, which is simpler&quot;."
"This struck a chord with me: &quot;Software Is about Developing Knowledge More than Writing Code&quot;<p>I&#x27;ve experienced more issues caused by management passing around tasks between teams and never paying attention to knowledge and knowledge transfer.<p>What&#x27;s amazing, is that in over 18 years as a software engineer, I&#x27;ve seen this so many times. Teams will function well, then the institution tries to change. Often they will try to open up the &quot;innovation&quot; by throwing money at R&amp;D, basically trying to add bodies in order to grow. Then you have tons of teams, and communication becomes very challenging, so then they grow some kind of &quot;task management&quot; layer. Management that never understands who actually _knows_ something, just tracks how much &quot;theoretical bandwidth&quot; they have and a wishlist of features to create. And then the crapware really starts flowing. And then I get bored and move on to the next place."

"I don&#x27;t understand why someone at Dropbox&#x27;s size and scale would go after C++ on mobile and blaze their own trail, when its probably more pragmatic to go native.<p>With that being said, I worked for a firm that extended the life of old ERP systems and we had to do a few mobile apps, we chose Xamarin because we were a shop of 7ish devs that had many projects to maintain and the cost of code sharing and familiarity with C# were our driving factors. It was a trade off most definitely but it was a pragmatic choice as well.<p>If you are capable of hiring more developers who know Java or Obj-C and can allow them to do only mobile development then its worth it to go native.<p>But, if you are a small company and know that Java,C# and Obj-C, C# developers are a little bit hard to find (depending on your developer market) then its probably more cost effective to go Xamarin or any other cross-platform code sharing model.<p>In the end its all about pragmatism."
"Google is equally horrible about adwords (and probably most other customer service related issues).<p>They terminated our adwords account saying that there was something wrong with the site it was advertising and giving  a list of 12 extremely general things which might be the problem, none of which seemed to apply.<p>They also provided no way to respond or get in touch with anyone at all. Their advice was &quot;fix whatever you think may have been the problem and try again&quot;.<p>This wasted a huge amount of time as we tried everything possible to fix the issue to no avail: they never said anything had been fixed and never sent more information.<p>Finally I got a contact at Google. They looked at our account, said it seemed to be a glitch, and reenabled it.<p>That&#x27;s no way to do customer service and is one reason why I think Google should be broken up, if only so that each part is smaller and feels the need to be more accountable."
"When bonds worth $14 trillion are in negative territory and when the 30-year US treasuries are at historical lows this is what happens, i.e. people are ready to throw money away at almost anything that flies and moves, as long as there&#x27;s a chance of double-digit returns.

"From tutorial:<p>&gt; Neoslavonic has 7 grammatical cases.<p>Fascinating. The vocative case has disappeared from Slovak (but not Czech). It exists historically, and is still available for ironic contexts, but scholars consider it dead.<p>Historically, for instance in the Lord&#x27;s Prayer: <i>Otče náš, ktorý si na nebesiach, ...</i> (Our Father who art in Heaven ...). This &quot;otče&quot; is the vocative case of &quot;otec&quot; (father), something a modern speaker wouldn&#x27;t use to address his or her father.<p>Ironically, in phrases like <i>chlapče môj ...</i> (my dear fellow&#x2F;boy ...), vocative of &quot;chlapec&quot; (boy)."

"I for one wish you the best of luck, and hope you develop an effective and accurate product. While I may have conflicting feelings about police municipalities and the justice system, the breathalyzer has overwhelmingly been a good thing, and has saved countless lives by keeping the roads safe.<p>Questions:<p>- What do you think the likelihood&#x2F;timeline is that these tests will eventually be comparable in speed and accuracy to alcohol breathalyzers?<p>- Have you yet looked into the legal implications of a cannabis breathalyzer? Does it fall under the same rules and restrictions of a standard breathalyzer?<p>- How rigorously are you testing for false positives? Can you tell someone who has taken drugs but they have worn off vs someone who is currently high?<p>- Will you be making your data open source? Companies that sell proprietary technology to police departments can notoriously complicate legal cases when they do not disclose technical limitations or the possibilities of false positives or negatives.<p>- Will you be restricting your product sales only to regions where marijuana is already legal?

"Sometimes I do wonder... how many people I see with regular jobs feel like they are using 10% of their abilities at those jobs?

But inside, I know I&#x27;m doing it 99% for the money.  It&#x27;s only because I didn&#x27;t run the gauntlet in the past and strike out on my dreams with 150% effort (I tried once, at probably 90% effort.  I failed.)<p>I had a friend and consulting boss who once told me, &quot;I don&#x27;t care what work I do; it&#x27;s just a day job, and it&#x27;s money.&quot;  And as with people who can happily do hookup after hookup on Tinder, I sometimes wish I were like them.  But when you really care about shit, it ties you up.  And when the stuff you care about is just one or two cogs in a big machine that isn&#x27;t really worth supporting, you die slowly for a wage.<p>My advice to young people (those of you who are in your first 5 years of employment) is to realize now that unless you want to become a business owner or want to do 12+ years of good effort in one of the big 5 (4?) consulting firms, you should just never grow your personal cost of living and instead focus on doing stuff you love - money be damned.

"ENSURE TO READ TO HELP PEOPLE LIVING WITH HERPES SIMPLEX VIRUS 1&amp; 2 AND HIV VIRUS GET CURE ..Hello all viewer online,,,, HERPES AND HIV has cure
Do anyone still doubt natural herbal medicine ? I&#x27;ve seen the great importance 
 and the great work of natural herbs and the wonderful work they have done in people&#x27;s lives. I wonder why people still spend their money on surgery, injections and drugs that can not cure you completely,. Natural herbs can cure all kinds of illness including herpes, diabetics, asthma, HIV, hepatitis, etc. I&#x27;ve seen it with my own eyes. I was cured of HIV virus and my aunt and her husband were cured of herpes virus and tested negative after usage of the herbal medicine an i was also cured of hiv and tested hiv negative after usage of the herbal medicine by Dr. MOHAMMED who uses natural herbs to cure different kind of illness. Even Dr. Sebi prove to the whole world that natural herbs can cure all diseases and he cured countless of people using natural herbs. I know is hard to believe but am a living testimony. There is no harm in trying herbal medicine, the herbal medicine was sent to me through DHL delivering company,,, this is not scam, i am a living witness of this, please believe me and save your life and other people&#x27;s life who victimize of the virus or any illness .  Contact or email Dr.Mohammed on: herbalcure12@gmail.com (phone call &#x2F;what-sap no): +2349036036397"

"You guys in the States have it bad. I hear terrible stories about the fear that now surrounds any kind of freedom for kids. Over here in the UK we’re a bit better, but the “give them exams ALL the time” and schools being on their knees, financially, are all too familiar.<p>For me, this journey with my kids has been about a massive slew of things, among the most important:<p>- extending their childhood where possible: encouraging actual play (and discouraging the pseudo-play of screens)
- letting them out: outside play when they’re younger (my kids dicked about in streams and woods from about 5&#x2F;6 years old); now they’re older (14&#x2F;12) they take themselves off swimming, into town, to the shops, on the bus to the nearest city 2 hours away, etc
- reading, reading, reading. Always.
- talking and appreciating them as adults and not as kids. This means trying not to patronise, being adult when talking about politics, religion, sex
- being more present: for example, I’ve had a Nokia 3310 rather than a smartphone for more than a year now, and a large part of this has been about not being constantly distracted when I’m with other people, particularly my kids
- be there: work less, hangout more. I work for myself, but never evenings or weekends, these are family time. I’m gonna be poor and will probably never retire but these years with my kids are as important as it gets. I’d rather be poor forever and have had this time with them. It’s all too short.<p>Kids need all the love, but too often this becomes smothering."

"Hello guys. It’s me, Hanif. Just a response to some of the comments here:<p>1. I think it’s absolutely fair to criticize this aspect of the analysis: the relative frequencies of the backgrounds of data scientists have been presented as suggesting the success rate from each field. Many of the comments in the post itself made a similar critique. As I’ve acknowledged in my responses to these comments, what we need are the relative frequencies of applicants from the different backgrounds, not just hires. However, one can justify the inference about the success rate of, say, Statisticians and Actuaries if one has the prior belief that the relative frequency of statistician applicants to DS positions should be higher than the observed relative frequency of statistician hires (&lt;1%!) to DS positions. I don’t think this is unreasonable.
2. I make a similar argument with regards to MOOCs&#x2F;bootcamps: my prior belief is that the relative frequency of bootcamp-only applicants should be higher than the observed relative frequency of bootcamp-only hires. Hence my statement about necessity vs. sufficiency.
3. It’s somewhat more complicated for applicants with both degrees and MOOCs&#x2F;bootcamps. I haven’t done this, but what I can do is to look at the education distribution for hires with and without MOOCs. If the education distributions were similar, it would suggest that MOOCs have negligible impact. If, however, there is a higher relative frequency of say Bachelor’s degrees in the MOOC category, that would suggest that MOOCs&#x2F;bootcamps have some value-added impact.
4. An ideal prospective study for the above would be to extract a sample of individuals from a precursor role, say, data analysts (hence naturally controlling for education). Note which of them have MOOCs or bootcamps, then follow them up in time to see how many end up as data scientists in each category.
5. I might actually change that profile picture. It’s 3 years old, in more innocent times.
6. As it happens I have landed a data scientist position in Singapore and will be starting in September."
"I really hope this works, but I fear it will die a shumway death. One of the issues is there are two complete run-times inside of Flash. AVM1 (for AS1&#x2F;2) and AVM2 (for AS3).

"I think there is just a fascinating parallel in the lives of two men who were both responsible for the key bit of knowledge that turned the fates of the European and the Pacific - Sorge and Rochefort.<p>Sorge’s key contribution to the war was the knowledge that the Japanese would not attack Russia in 1941, which allowed Stalin to move forces to save Moscow. Rochefort on the other hand led the intelligence effort that allowed Nimitz to ambush the Japanese fleet six months later. Both of these men ultimately lost “office politics” which led to them both being marginalized and ignored by their governments after their great victories. Rochefort ended up the better of the two, only being reduced to building dry docks, while Sorge ended up being shot,even though the Japanese tried multiple times to trade him back for their own captured spies.<p>One side note - it’s amazing how good and ruthless the soviet spy network was.

But the machines it takes to produce a conforming iPhone require technology, skill, and technique the Chinese <i></i>currently<i></i> do not possess.<p>So, believe it or not (I can prove it) the Chinese buy their factory equipment from small suppliers in the U.S. where the quality is decent enough to get equipment capable of producing an iPhone. We make the machines they use to laminate screens.<p>We are currently incentivizing China to develop the technology to domestically create the iPhone.

We&#x27;re teaching Huawei how to make an iPhone by brute force by making it economical to do so.<p>Nevermind the price of materials like aluminum has gone crazy.

"In Vietnam the plan to build a nuclear power plant was shelved due to the lack of fund and opposition from the people. Guess what replaced it? Three coal power plants! As if that is any cleaner! Russia being embargoed isn&#x27;t helping either, as we intended to use Russian nuclear technology.<p>As a developing country, Vietnam&#x27;s electricity consumption will triple around 2030, overtaking Great Britain around 2027. Coal will provide half of that, as renewables alone is not enough. But what else can us developing countries do? Stop developing and stay poor forever?"

Sure, it requires some level of knowledge of the town, but no level of knowledge of the town is going to make &quot;HW8C+FH&quot; something that someone can picture.  They&#x27;re going to have to plug it into their phone.<p>I work in real estate, and this doesn&#x27;t really solve anything for our system either.

"I don&#x27;t think remote work is that good. It has its benefits like having more time, flexible schedule and work from where you want but this comes at a price: you work alone every day, your colleagues are in different timezones, you need to set hard rules on your work schedule and socializing is a must. Think of all the things you get for granted working from an office: colleagues, events, pair programming, face to face meetings, small talk breaks. Again I do agree the remote work has its benefits but everything comes at a cost."

"I am a parent of two boys—ages 7 and 4–and I hardly recognize  the negative forces that this author laments over because my wife and I have simply chosen not to raise our kids that way.<p>When my boys get home, we get outside and do sports.   We’re in the middle of (tackle) football season right now and that’s what my 7 year-old does five days a week for two hours every evening.  It’s exercise, fun, camaraderie, and lessons for life, all rolled together.   My four year-old spends the practices on the sidelines, digging in the dirt with other little brothers and sisters and chasing the bigger kids around the track when they run laps.<p>When football season is over, we move on to other team sports.  When those are over, we ride our bikes around the neighborhood and play pick-up football games in the front yard.<p>What we don’t do:  iPads, TVs, or smart phones.  It’s not that came into parenthood with some anti-technology mindset.  Rather, we let our kids have these devices and we saw immediately the negative effects on their behavior, attitude, and motivation, and so we took them away.  They get to use them on the rarest of circumstances: during airplane rides or as a brief reward for a week of good behavior.<p>Adam Carolla once said that the problem with kids isn’t all of the things that we’ve added to childhood, it’s all the things we’ve taken away.  Sports, free time, boredom, tree forts, and neighborhood exploration have all been curtailed.  For much of this, we have over-involved, over-concerned mothers to thank (and a bunch of dads that think like moms).<p>It doesn’t have to be this way.  Nobody is forcing us to raise our kids in the post-millennium style.  You <i>can</i> raise tough, resourceful, happy, outdoors-loving kids if you want to.<p>If you are a parent of little ones, have a look at this article:<p><a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2016&#x2F;10&#x2F;23&#x2F;magazine&#x2F;the-anti-helicopter-parents-plea-let-kids-play.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2016&#x2F;10&#x2F;23&#x2F;magazine&#x2F;the-anti-helicop...</a>"

Was in China when the first protest happened and the news coverage was mostly saying things like that the people are clueless in Hong Kong and don’t understand the law about extradition. They had various experts all saying similar things and they would also point to random weibo posts about totally not on the payroll “people” saying they want their city back from the protesters.. I mean it’s one thing if China’S central government wants Hong Kong to be a certain way but dressing it up as “lots of ordinary folks agree with them” is pretty disingenuous and it seems very fair for any platform to call the government out on it—-especially non-Chinese owned platforms.
"Meditation sometimes reveals itself through meditation. It&#x27;s kinda like recursion in programming. I come from Vietnam. Meditation in Vietnamese is translated literally to &quot;sitting zen&quot; (ngồi thiền). Sitting seems like the optimal balance point for meditation. Standing&#x2F;walking has more distraction. Lying down makes you prone to sleeping. Now, I haven&#x27;t figured out which sitting position is more optimal. Perhaps, the lotus position is popular for a reason."

"We never really used Encarta, and I don&#x27;t really know anyone who ever did. Right in the middle of the CD-ROMs are big and DSL just starting to become available period we got a few educational CDs that did more specialised things like only the history and current state of geographical information, or just mathematics, or just historical events of one country. No full encyclopedia was really digitally popular as the schools and libraries all had plenty of physical copies and people around to help use&#x2F;find them.<p>It probably didn&#x27;t help that it was a Microsoft-only deal as most of the stuff was an odd mix Netware-driven PC&#x27;s without Optical drives (we had ZIP!) or library computers that were locked in a box so you couldn&#x27;t really put a CD in them. And everything else was an Apple Mac, so you could put the CD in but you got nothing out of it.<p>We did have something else, I don&#x27;t remember the name of it, but it was like a network-CD-drive-server device that worked on Windows 95, 98 and 2000, as well as Macs, and we had a cross-platform (flash&#x2F;shockwave based AFAIK) viewer thing that was probably an encyclopaedia but it was never named or marketed as such. It didn&#x27;t have videos but it did have the same information as the paper versions.<p>Most people who did end up owning (some version of) Encarta got a demo or companion version with some other product, much like the Microsoft Works package you sometimes got with systems, but right around that time Wikipedia was already gaining popularity."
"An interesting assertion, but the article is both vacuous and confusing. It doesn’t link to the underlying study, combines what one tends to think of as kanji (single characters) with more complex juku-kanji (multiple characters) with straight up whole dictionary words. Some of those words are presented with English definitions to the side, but most aren’t. Some of the kanji are presented with pronunciations, but most aren’t. There’s no support for the thesis statement.<p>I have no particular reason to disbelieve the headline, it sounds reasonable enough, but this page in specific is doing nothing to persuade me of its main point."

He discovered this artifact in the research methodology, wherein the horse was responding directly to involuntary cues in the body language of the human trainer, who had the faculties to solve each problem. The trainer was entirely unaware that he was providing such cues."
"Data science is so obscure the author is right to point out how there&#x27;s a real difference between what a data scientist actually does and what he needs to do to actually get a job in data science.

"The testing and treatment of tick borne pathogens is a fine line between politics, science and empathy is because many people have been treated poorly by the medical industry. The majority of the symptoms are ignored by physicians or misdiagnosed. In many cases, co-infections or existing immuno-suppressive conditions are ignored by physicians. That&#x27;s happened to a number of people I know.<p>It is very common for most practitioners to be ignorant of: HLA DR gene types (can accumulate metals, mycotoxins, lyme toxins, etc), the nature of the Lyme bacteria strains: spirochtte (reproductive, doxycycline susceptible), round bound starvation form (resistant to most antiobiotics), and the nature of biofilm colonies (antibiotic resistant) that exist in nature and our bodies. Furthermore, most physicians do not know what labs and tests to apply to a patient: Igenex and Galaxy labs for Lyme, Bartonella, Babesia, etc testing; c3a, c4a, tgf-b1, mmp-9, inflammation markers.<p>In short, each human phenotype, genetic expression, and immune context are all highly unique ... which means that every case is different. Inflammation from our immune response is the primary driver of symptoms and is very, very often mis-diagnosed as something else like MS or dementia (happened to a number of people I know). We need a lot more data to finally help educate physicians and bring the vast majority them out of the stone age. We need to educate everyone on complex systems, nutrition, and biology instead of just authority."

"&quot;Ignore advice&quot; is not good advice. Even for startups. There are so many predictable ways that founders screw up. I,  personally, have committed most of them. A few of them I avoided, or stopped doing soon enough to survive, and often it was with the help of good advice. YC gives good advice: Talk to your users. Build something people want. Run lean. Those are all great for people starting out. There is a lot of knowledge much more specialized that, contained in the collective wisdom of startup operators and investors. The challenge is to vet your sources, know which advice applies to your situation, and how to implement it. Nobody can teach you how to be a good judge of character. And nobody knows your startup well enough to decide for you which advice and how. But we can all learn from others who have gone through the ringer, whether it&#x27;s PG, Michael Seibel, Naval, Lemkin or others."
"I recently wrote two blog posts that touch on this. I honestly think many people cannot tell real automation from &quot;a box full of little elves with a tech interface.&quot; (I often compare it to the MIB2 scene where Will Smith opens the <i>automatic mail sorting machine</i> and reveals a multi-armed alien rapidly flinging mail, not robotic parts.)<p>It&#x27;s made me less aggravated with certain things to realize that. It also makes me wonder if founders are genuinely being intentionally deceptive or just unclear where to draw that line themselves.<p>How much AI inside the box do you need to qualify as an AI company when advertising what you do and wooing VC money? I bet some people honestly don&#x27;t know and some of those people may be in decision-making positions at such companies.<p>Serious tech people may be clear on that, but most companies involve more than just tech people. If your PR people don&#x27;t really get it and your tech people don&#x27;t have adequate power to insist &quot;You cannot market the company this way,&quot; then it will get sorted out in ugly headlines and court cases and the like."

"I think the biggest realization I&#x27;ve ever had is that things take time away. The sensation of procrastination happens when you feel the &quot;thing you need to do&quot; should take some smaller constrained amount of time, usually in days or weeks or sometimes months.<p>But if you can stomach that the thing may take years or even a decade, you&#x27;d feel much less like you were procrastinating.<p>In addition, if you assume that the thing will always be done piecemeal, here and there, or when you can remember to do it say like cleaning a room or organizing a thing, then that can also alleviate the sensation of procrastination.<p>The sensation tends to occur when you maintain a false belief that the things you need to get done should take hours or days instead of weeks or years."

"I read imap description long time ago, and I know what it does in principle (along with issues itt), but can someone explain what value does it serve today? I have two confusing thoughts.<p>First, imap seems to be an overkill for a line wider than 64kbps. Texts do not consume much traffic and an entire mailbox can be served easily to everyone. There are some huge mailboxes out there, but messengers have this problem too and they solve it somehow (I suspect trivial &amp;last_date=... from programming tg bots).<p>Second, and this may be due to bad clients (haven’t seen good however), imap is just sloooow. It doesn’t update instantly, but instead I have to enter every folder and pull down with my finger to update it. It can show outdated messages which I deleted on a pc <i>for ten seconds</i> before it figures out that they were deleted. My guess that it has something to do with an infinite number of roundtrips which this protocol is based on. Occasionally it shows N unread when there is none. Even push notifications fail to work properly most of the time (same server-side issues?) And with all these complications, I still have to download every attachment by finger. How come that heavy sites&#x2F;forums&#x2F;boards&#x2F;messengers always instantly show new data and mail cannot? I know that I can simply use webmail, but wtf?<p>I’m a developer, but when I see software, I always try to evaluate it from user-only perspective. And from that, mail tech seems simply incompetent. I wish there was a port smtp-&gt;tg and tg-&gt;smtp, and special per-subj chats, so I could leave all that legacy for someone else to deal with and just talk to them without missing messages or <i>waiting</i> for updates.<p>(Not even considering mail message formatting, spam mismatches, size restrictions and non-delivery laws)"

"The article lists the characteristics of a good engineer:<p><pre><code>  * has a better grasp of existing software they can reuse
  * (has) a better grasp of engineering tools, automating away most of the routine aspects of their own job
  * design systems that are more robust and easier to understand by others
  * the decisions they make save you from work you did not know could be avoided
</code></pre>
I obviously concord with the analysis (not sure about the 10X myth). It also states that:<p><pre><code>  * Google, Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, and Microsoft all run a dizzying number of the largest technology systems in the world, yet, they famously have some of the most selective interview processes
</code></pre>
This sounds a bit like a paradox to me. Given the current state of &quot;selective interview processes&quot; (algo riddles, whiteboard coding, etc.), none of the above traits can be easily evaluated in a candidate during an interview. On the other hand, these companies <i>do hire</i> stellar engineers: the technological supremacy of FAANG is irrefutable."

"&quot;Once in a while, I like to indulge in an informative anecdote concerning the genesis of the proof. The criterion was found by the end of 1985; then I remained more than six months making circles around the « splitting tensor ». One nice day of August 1986, I woke up in a camp in Siena and I had got the proof: I therefore sat down and wrote a manuscript of 10 pages. One month later, while recopying this with my typewriter, I discovered that one of my lemmas about imperialism was wrong: no importance, I made another one! This illustrates the fact, neglected by the formalist ideology, that a proof is not the mere putting side by side of logical rules, it is a global perception: since I had found the concept of empire, I had my theorem and the faulty lemma was hardly more than a misprint.&quot;<p>- Jean-Yves Girard, The Blind Spot"

As we reach higher and higher penetration of renewables on the grid, we will need to dead with the intermittency more and more. A common phrase I hear at utility conferences nowadays is, &quot;We used to forecast load and deploy generation, but in the future, we will be forecasting generation and deploying load.&quot;<p>I think this area will be the next wave of innovation that needs to happen in the energy transition, and it&#x27;s going to be primarily software driven.

"My wife and I have 2.5 and 0.7 year olds. Because of remote work, I have the luxury of living basically anywhere. My wife and I made the move from a 300k city to a 40k city about 45 minutes away.<p>There&#x27;s many reasons we did. Chiefly, it&#x27;s far far cheaper. But also, it&#x27;s calmer and quieter and just a nicer way to live.  What we didn&#x27;t expect to see, which we are absolutely delighted about, is how different childhood seems to get lived in a much smaller city.  There have been roving bands of children on bikes all summer getting into who knows what kind of awesome mischief.<p>We go on completely random drives 3 or 4 times a week, just wandering the city to get to know it better (and get the youngest to nap) and we see kids and young teens all over the place without parents.<p>Anecdotally of course, but I wonder if smaller cities&#x2F;towns lend themselves to a far more trusting, free, safe environment to grow up. When I picture letting my boys, when older, go out on their own, I&#x27;m thinking about the difference between here and where I used to live. The scariest street has 4 lanes total and is a 50km&#x2F;h.  There&#x27;s no rapid transit to smoosh them. There&#x27;s a wonderful central park just one traffic light away. Literally everything in the city is a bike ride away."

"I think all of this discussion about whether or not LIDAR or cameras are better misses the point that really matters- Will cameras actually be good enough to get the job done? If they are then it doesn&#x27;t matter which is better. You can always add additional sensors and get more information, but engineering has always been a cost vs benefit problem. If adding LIDAR doesn&#x27;t give a significant benefit in scenarios that cameras are not already good enough, then they might not be worth the additional expense."
"There was a great iOS game back in the day called &quot;One Single Life&quot; or some such. The game had you jump between buildings, and if you ever fell to your death, well then the app stopped working completely.

"Nice Post. But everyone needs to understand something. Even if you follow these principles to the letter T, you can still produce very bad software. In fact you can also find many cases where people did the exact opposite of what this guy said and still produced great software. I&#x27;m sure many people can name examples of software that just came together out of blind luck.<p>Why?<p>Because there is no formal definition for what is bad or good software. Nobody knows exactly why software gets bad or why software gets good or what it even exactly is... It&#x27;s like predicting the weather. The interacting variables form a movement so complex that it is somewhat impossible to predict with 100% accuracy.<p>What you&#x27;re reading from this guy is the classic anecdotal post of design opinions that you literally can get from thousands of other websites. I&#x27;m seriously tired of reading this stuff year over year rehashing the same BS over and over again, yet still seeing most software inevitably become bloated and harder to work with over time.<p>What I want to see is a formal theory of software design and by formal I mean mathematically formal. A axiomatic theory that tells me definitively the consequences of a certain design. An algorithm that when applied to a formal model produces a better model.<p>We have ways to formally prove a program 100% correct negating the need for unit tests, but do we have a formal theory on how to modularize code and design things so that they are future proof and remain flexible and understandable to future programmers? No we don&#x27;t. Can we develop such a theory? I think it&#x27;s possible."
"IKEA seem to be killing it in speaker area these days. Even as Swede, that&#x27;s kind of unexpected.

"My Lyme story is probably one of the less dramatic posted here, but it is telling that I feel like I was relatively taken good care of compared to many others here and elsewhere. My first symptom was the classic erythema migrans (bullseye rash), which was painful on its own, but given that this was during summertime in southern Italy it got unbearable at times. I saw a doctor who told me I had probably been bitten by a spider or lizard, but nothing to worry about. I asked him about Lyme but he insisted there were no ticks in Italy (!)... Eventually I got low fever and terrible upper joint pains, as well as deformed nails and fingers (the second stage of Lyme). This was still not enough for the doc as again, there are no ticks in Italy... After a short time Bell&#x27;s palsy kicked in (severe facial paralysis and a drastic change in taste in my case) and then I knew that I was 100% dealing with Lyme. So off we go to Italy&#x27;s main institution for infectious diseases where they tap me for an insane amount of blood to analize, and tell me I will stay at the hospital for maybe a week. Tests came back and Lyme was positive, even though there are no ticks in Italy... I ended up staying at the hospital almost two months with antibiotics pumped intravenously multiple times a day for hours. After recovering I had to go to the hospital for health controls every 2-3 months or so for a around a year.<p>And I was lucky enough to go through this during a time where antibiotics are still effective at fighting bacterias. One of my biggest fears is entering a post-antibiotic era, where bacterias grow resistant at a faster rate than we are discovering new antibiotics. If we keep misusing them, to erroneously treat ourselves, to feed livestock, pumping the rest products into rivers, this might not be such a far fetched scenario."

"When the recession hits (more controversially the bubble pops), I’m not sure what will happen to WeWork.<p>I would guess it will collapse, as tenants leave and it can’t pay for its rental costs.<p>But on the flip side, in a recession landlords become much more open to renegotiating terms, and more people freelance or start their own business when they lose their jobs.

"The mind is the layer that we use to make sense of the world, it is designed to see outside because of the way the world works, but it is difficult to see inside.<p>Every concept that we can come up with is articulated in terms of concepts that have been stored in the minds memory (inference) the funny thing is that we are born with almost empty minds as we grow older it starts to feel up to the point where we cant even think without using language which is also not inborn but is acquired here on earth through the mind.<p>The problem is to see behind this layer. If we observe the mind through the mind we only see that it is a mechanism for storage, processing and inference of the stored data. Learning is simply finding new inferences between data or acquiring new data from the senses that are connected to the mind.<p>But as humans we are biologically limited, our senses can not even pick up everything this already implies that the what we know through the mind will always be limited (unless if you believe in evolution and that our senses will evolve).<p>Meditation does this with a sort of denial of the knowledge that we acquired through the mind (closely related to the nature of the ego) that is why highly spiritual people often say perceived reality is an illusion, and to some a deity is a way to see outside of the box.<p>AI is trying to simulate the mind with what we know about it through it.<p>I also feel like this is what the incompleteness theorem is about, we have some sort of axioms of Intelligence that we got through the mind but these finite axioms can not proof all the dynamics of Intelligence."
"Even if you <i>know</i> that your company is doing nothing to find exposed secrets on the web, can a single engineer just tell their manager, &quot;Hey, you know what?

"“Finding 1: most data scientists have postgraduate degrees”<p>Data Scientists primarily function to tell a story (based upon data) that technicals and non-technicals alike will use in business decisions.  It’s critical that a Data Scientist <i>be perceived</i> as trustworthy, since the decision-makers are unlikely to reproduce or even understand the Data Scientist’s full argument.<p>What signals trustworthiness? A graduate degree from a Harvard Yale Princeton Stanford (HYPS) or similar university definitely speaks well for a candidate.  Online degree programs like Coursera &#x2F; Udacity &#x2F; etc won’t carry nearly the same weight until their alumnae network grows, and that will require growing into non-technical fields.<p>What signals <i>untrustworthiness</i> ?  Sadly, the “hacker” skills that are so very key in DS (e.g. for data cleaning) are completely at odds with traditional (and especially non-technical) assessments of trustworthiness.  Many companies in the Bay Area will look past this issue, but it’s arguably a competitive advantage to simply be able to assess “hacker” skills effectively.  That also entails making space for “hackers” at your company.  Can’t take hackers? You probably will never hire a good Data Scientist."

Yes, there are lots of benefits to rendering static HTML if your interface doesn&#x27;t have much dynamic state. And yes, React can still be a useful tool in the right context. Those who say you should use it for everything are naive. Hopefully your team lead who&#x27;s making these decisions isn&#x27;t naive.

"Great article. I worked at a Forex trading firm and this is a great way to explain China&#x27;s dilemma.<p>Really, this is kind of what happened to every other east Asian economy the past 60 years.

And every country who has copied it as done so less effectively than the Japanese.<p>First Japan, then Korea, then Taiwan, now China.<p>For me, the fundamental advantage in this trade war with the US is that the Chinese are replaceable for the American economy. Sure, there will be some pains as companies move their factories from China to Vietnam (or wherever), but ultimately, there are other places in the world with cheap labor.<p>There is no other America in the world. China&#x27;s number one customer is America and China doesn&#x27;t seem to realize this. If you don&#x27;t keep your relationship good with your number one customer, then you will lose them eventually.<p>And that&#x27;s what&#x27;s happening.<p>The Chinese have to get better at international relations or they will be more isolated as time goes on.<p>No one wants to deal with a partner who bullies them around.

I assume that we want to access these arrays as &quot;array of structs&quot; for most functions but as &quot;structure of arrays&quot; for some calculation intensive functions. The article suggests storing it as array of structs and to make copies for those calculations but this seems inefficient to me. Modern C++ should provide a way to efficiently decouple the access model from the memory layout.<p>Can we hide the actual memory layout without big overhead using C++ inline&#x2F;template functions&#x2F;classes? Would that be the visitor pattern?

"It&#x27;s not just the art market, though. The numbers are absurd in the fine art market, since it&#x27;s a place where rich people go to compete with each other in games the rest of us don&#x27;t get to play.<p>But eBay is full of sci-fi memorabilia with certificates of authenticity. A uniform actually worn by Patrick Stewart on screen sells for more than one that was made for him but not worn, which sells for more than a copy made with the same materials. You might actually be able to wear the latter, but the first two would just be set out for display, like the Mona Lisa.<p>That&#x27;s a game we can all play, and while I&#x27;m not really much into it, I am proud of my author-signed Klingon Dictionary for no good reason -- especially since I never even look at it.

"A priori, the most believable thesis to me would be that <i>Finding Dory</i> increased both interest in keeping blue tang fish as pets and generic internet searches about them.<p>It&#x27;s also misleading to conflate keeping members of a species as pets with damaging the wild population.

 dogs). I don&#x27;t know much about the ecosystem in which blue tang live, but I&#x27;d expect most aquarium fish to be more like dogs than pandas in this comparison."
"People who quote &quot;premature optimization is etc.&quot; never provide the full quote. The full quote has a significant degree of highly important nuance.<p>&gt; &quot;Programmers waste enormous amounts of time thinking about, or worrying about, the speed of noncritical parts of their programs, and these attempts at efficiency actually have a strong negative impact when debugging and maintenance are considered. We should forget about small efficiencies, say about 97% of the time: premature optimization is the root of all evil. Yet we should not pass up our opportunities in that critical 3%.&quot;<p>&quot;Premature optimization is the root of all evil&quot; is incomplete without the surrounding context, and people unfortunately take it to mean &quot;never worry about how efficient your code is,&quot; which is not at all what Knuth intended."

Separating the three basic concepts of planning, making decisions, and actually doing the work, into discrete sessions, has been a life changer.<p>I still fuck off constantly and hate myself for procrastination from time to time, obviously, but using the core GTD framework and returning to it when I stray has <i>really</i> helped."

Unless you use something that is completely configurable by text, which is pretty hard to accomplish, then it&#x27;s basically impossible to get a snapshot of your services. It&#x27;s even harder to roll stuff back. Or branch it off and test out a new configuration. I&#x27;d wager that a lot of issues in production are configuration related, simply because it&#x27;s harder to introspect and code review versus code changes. Hopefully that can be fixed."
"I often struggle trying to explain to more junior developers that there are times when it&#x27;s OK to write code more than once.  There is a mindset that you should only ever write code once.

"I was very fortunate that my university had a ton of old Lisp books, and after browsing through a bunch of them I found some really good ones and learned from those.  Unfortunately, I don&#x27;t remember the titles (though a book on CLOS stands out in my memory as being an excellent introduction to the awesome power of OO programming in Lisp), but if you have a university with a good comp sci library you may want to check it out.<p>Parenthetically, I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s true but I&#x27;d heard that there have been more books published on Lisp than all books on other programming languages combined.<p>I&#x27;d also recommend that anyone who starts out with Common Lisp give a modern Scheme (like Chicken, Racket, or Guile) a try.  I found Scheme to be much more to my taste and once I learned it I viewed CL as quite backwards in many ways, so Scheme is what I use today if I can at all help it.<p>Finally, newbies should check out Emacs and eLisp.  eLisp is more primitive than either CL or Scheme, but it&#x27;s still great when combined with Emacs, which you can customize and improve to your heart&#x27;s content.  In addition, there&#x27;s a mountain of eLisp code to build on for you Emacs improvement projects.  I came to eLisp after learning both CL and Scheme, so it was pretty easy to pick up, and that&#x27;s what I&#x27;d recommend others do too, just so you first learn what Lisp is truly capable of."

"As I understand it, other countries&#x27; &quot;belief in our debt&quot; has little to do with their treasury holding levels.

I&#x27;ve thought about this a decent amount and I just can&#x27;t agree that unsupervised outdoor wandering is a good thing before maybe middle school. Kids are stupid and even the smart ones get peer pressured into doing stupid things that can injure or kill them. Like when I crushed my wrist riding a bike downhill on a paved road in 2nd or 1st grade. Those kids apparently rode on roads all the time which looking back seems irresponsible as hell.<p>Unsupervised in a house or on a property in a good area is fine too. I just can&#x27;t agree with letting small kids wander into cities or roads or forests on their own.<p>On the other hand I feel like open-ended and&#x2F;or educational video games like Minecraft fill a similar need for self determination&#x2F;experimentation&#x2F;exploration just fine to a degree.

"&gt;&gt; I could see all this. Why couldn&#x27;t they?<p>Having worked mind-numbing jobs like packer at a warehouse, I can assure you
that most people can see &quot;all this&quot; just as clearly as Bukowski. Like
Bukowski, they are unable to do anything to change &quot;how things are&quot;, but
unlike Bukowski they don&#x27;t have a guaridan angel to lift them off the daily
rat race and into a successful creative career. More importantly, perhaps,
unlike Bukowski, many of those people have responsibilities, specifically to
their families and particularly their kids, responsibilities that they
recognise and that they usually accept. Or in any case, those who accept those
responsibilities give up any dreams of a &quot;free&quot; life and do what best they can
to fulfil those responsibilities. If that means working at a 9-to-not-quite-5
job that eats you from the inside, because there is no better option, then
that&#x27;s what it means.<p>But Bukowski asks: why do people have children? Because that&#x27;s what people do,
if you look around you. People make more people. Perhaps we are all slaves of
evolution that has programmed us this way but a sizeable chunk of people find
that they love their children even before they have them, even if they find
that they can never have them. Some people are not like that and some can&#x27;t
even stand the idea of having children. Perhaps those people are lucky,
perhaps they are the real unlucky ones. Who knows."

As we continue to invest in our business, we have incurred net losses of $17.3 million, $10.7 million, and $87.2 million for 2016, 2017, and 2018, respectively. For the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2019, our revenue increased from $87.1 million to $129.2 million, an increase of 48%, and we incurred net losses of $32.5 million and $36.8 million, respectively.<p>Compared to the numbers we&#x27;ve seen for recent tech IPOs, being on track to lose about $72M for 2019 seems reasonable.<p>Also, haven&#x27;t read through it all but I&#x27;m curious how strong this clause will be for future control:<p>&gt; The dual-class structure of our common stock will have the effect of concentrating voting control with those stockholders who held our capital stock prior to the completion of this offering, and it may depress the trading price of our Class A common stock."

"There is an actual problem here, but wireless carriers use the actual problem of how to balance traffic as a fake cover for charging more.<p>However, assuming we bypass the garbage tiering, there is a legitimate reason to do this.  Page-loads are simple and fast.  Every one loading pages is not much of an issue, as they typically load at different times for a brief moment and then are done.  This means for a rated connection speed, you don&#x27;t need as much actual capacity.<p>Video streaming (or other downloads) are constant.  To stream video at rated speeds, you must build to provide most users that speed at the same time.  Problem two here is that in cases of high traffic, video streaming is <i>greedy</i>.  If it&#x27;s not going at full resolution, it will suck up all available bandwidth it is given.  If more is given, it will raise quality (by default settings, at least).<p>A sensible solution to this is to stream video and audio over UDP and have the router just drop UDP when TCP needs bandwidth (to a point).  The point is, requirements are different.  People sending e-mails shouldn&#x27;t have to wait a minute to send because you <i>really</i> want to stream your netflix every where you go and in 4k.<p>Which reminds me, I thought mobile connections were for simple stuff.  Light browsing, email, what-have-you.  Even with &quot;unlimited&quot; plans, you&#x27;re throttled after twenty-odd gigabytes of data per month.

"I used qmail for about ten years. It was remarkably good from a sysadmin&#x27;s perspective:<p>- the config system mostly used the name of a directory where lots of software would use a filename (qmail.ini =&gt; &#x2F;var&#x2F;qmail&#x2F;conf), the name of a file where other software would use a variable name, and the contents of the file as the value of the variable. This is really, really easy to read and write without writing a parsing library.<p>- separate executables do separate jobs, with well-documented interfaces between them. Oh, and if a part didn&#x27;t need root, it didn&#x27;t run as root, and if a part didn&#x27;t need to be the same user as another, it didn&#x27;t share users. While it was easiest to replace something at the edge of the graph, it was entirely possible to replace middle jobs as well.<p>- qmail was the original design home of Maildir. I approve of various Maildir++ implementations (nesting folders is useful) and you could add support for them by replacing your delivery agent.<p>- qmail expected to be controlled by daemontools, a supervision system that has inspired&#x2F;been blatantly copied and improved upon as runit, perp, s6, and nosh.

"I think the final point is where there is the most leverage- giving preference to long term ownership interests over short term interests.  Time based voting preferences, longer minimum holding periods for manager stock grants, more tax differential on long and short term gains and similar policies have potential to create an environment which is not as focused on the daily stock price and the quarterly numbers.  Having the company serve the purpose of its owners is not a bad thing, otherwise the concept of ownership is meaningless, but if the intention of some of those owners is to briefly increase its value or liquidate assets to increase short term returns at the expense of longer term returns, that seems worthy of disincentivizing."

"I&#x27;ve been using C++ to share code between iOS and Android for years and have come to the same conclusion. I developed the C++ code on desktop operating systems which was easier to debug, but once you move it to mobile then the debugging gets a lot harder (on Android at least).<p>The overhead of the JNI interface is quite a lot of work too. Luckily I had a UML model that I generated the interfaces out of, so adding JNI was just a matter of templating this out of the UML, but it was still quite a bit of work.<p>On iOS the situation has gotten worse in that the interface between Swift and C++ has to go through C, so if you are using C++ you need a special interface layer, which is almost like the JNI situation on Android.<p>So you have the trade-off of on one hand having two code bases (Swift, Kotlin) and the associated headache of keeping them in sync, versus the extra work of maintaining the C++ interface layers and testing and debugging on each platform. In the end I now believe that it is better to work with the platform native development tools rather than trying to share C++.<p>As far as finding developers goes, because of the rarity of using C++ on mobile there will not be a lot of developers with this experience. I work remotely and have found that any remote C++ work is very rare, Swift and Kotlin are a lot easier to find work with (it&#x27;s still more difficult that you would think to get remote work of any type)."

"It looks like that took very poor decisions such as bad frameworks and in-house made libraries vs what was already existing.<p>First, it&#x27;s not true that there&#x27;s no C++ mobile community. There are plenty of forums, blog posts, projects, using C++ in mobile field. Xamarin and Qt are helping C++ Devs go mobile since years.<p>Second, it depends on which standard they&#x27;ve used. It looks like they choose a pre-C++11 standard, making things more complicated (in 2013 there were already full C++11 compliant compilers, even for mobile), especially threads. They probably forgot that Boost itself has modules for JSON, checks for non null objects and so on.<p>Third, they probably kicked off the project with some average C++ developers and they left. They haven&#x27;t found cheap experts (compared to Kotlin&#x2F;Swift, which are really cheaper) and didn&#x27;t want to pay high salaries.
The story that those Kotlin&#x2F;Swift developers didn&#x27;t want to learn C++ says a lot of the quality of those developers as well.

"&gt; The microbes’ apparent ability to ingest electrons — known as direct electron transfer — is particularly intriguing because it seems to defy the basic rules of biophysics. The fatty membranes that enclose cells act as an insulator, creating an electrically neutral zone once thought impossible for an electron to cross. “No one wanted to believe that a bacterium would take an electron from inside of the cell and move it to the outside,” said Kenneth Nealson, a geobiologist at the University of Southern California, in a lecture to the Society for Applied Microbiology in London last year.<p>One could say the same about Na+, K+, and Ca++. So what&#x27;s so hard to imagine about electron carriers?"

"Does this strategy still work in a world with highest possibility of migration we ever had? If I live in a consumption repressed country and can see through the internet that the consumption rate is much better in other countries, I will also use my talent and resources to move to that country.<p>Since I can build a network online, since I can investigate laws online, even of other countries, since I can book and prepay for different steps to take in migration I have a much easier time than ever before to simply go somewhere else.<p>At the same time the psychological bonding between people and nations is lower than ever since the creation of nation states. If someone tells you they live at 20% the value they would want to live, just because they want to support their country, you would laugh about them.<p>And last but not least, more and more succeeding in the competition of production talent and creativity is more important than anything else. E.g. a soldier with low IQ and lots of muscles might have been great 500 years ago. But nowadays he simply gets shredded by a drone that was constructed by a nerd with technical talents and zero muscles.<p>Altogether it doesn&#x27;t seem very logical to me that such a move can really improve China&#x27;s situation, if it makes them lose talent quicker."
"This is silly and will further harm GCP&#x27;s viability as alternative to AWS or Azure.

"Desktop Linux systems often feature some kind of automount capability so you can just plug in an external drive and have it work. Windows and macOS provide similar facilities. Per the article, is this actually insecure? Will plugging in a corrupt&#x2F;maliciously modified ext4-formatted drive on an automount Linux system enable kernel compromise? If so, why is it that this is generally OK on Windows&#x2F;macOS (barring silly things like autostart viruses)?"

"It feels an awful lot like the people putting out this statement want to position themselves as the actual driving force behind the focus on shareholder value in the 80s, and thus use that branding to also posit an authority to change future corporate governance in a way that accommodates the current political climate. It&#x27;s absurd to think that they would have that kind of power, but that aspect of it is probably harmless in the long run; I think the bigger concern is how this statement can be used and incorporated as a bigger vision for governance that appears to address fundamental problems with the way our economy is run without actually addressing them, much the way a focus on plastic straws lets people feel like they&#x27;re addressing ocean plastic without actually addressing it."

"Well, I&#x27;ll be the dark cloud here.  As someone who used APL professionally for a decade, having studied and interacted with many of the early APL pioneers, including Ken Iverson, everything related to J, including this article&#x27;s proposal, is an absolute abomination to me.<p>What many people lack is a sense of history.  Why does something like J even exist?  Do you know?  I do.  It was a horrible mistake on the part of Iverson in response to the limitations of the hardware issues we had to deal with at the time (think 80&#x27;s).<p>How does a man who authored a paper exalting the advantages and power of notation as a tool for thought [0], turn around and create something like J?<p>Simple answer:  Business, for the most part, and, if I am going to be benevolent, a naive attempt to bring something to the masses (while destroying APL).<p>Here&#x27;s what you had to do at the time if you wanted to run APL on IBM PC&#x27;s (or clones):<p><pre><code>    - Buy a specific motherboard (if it was not an original IBM PC)
    - Buy a specific graphics card (which really wasn&#x27;t a graphics card at all, just text)
    - Purchase or program a character EPROM that replaced rarely used characters with APL characters
    - Swap out the stock character ROM with the custom EPROM
    - In some cases install a toggle switch outside the computer to be able to switch between APL and standard ROM&#x27;s
    - Purchase either an IBM Selectric or pinwheel printer
    - Purchase an expensive character ball for your IBM printer or an equally expensive APL character for your printer
    - And then you had to buy your APL interpreter from a company like STSC for hundreds of 1980&#x27;s dollars
</code></pre>
This meant a number of things:<p><pre><code>    - APL was outside the purview of &quot;civilians&quot;
    - Normal office environments were never going to consider something like this
    - There was a cost and technical complexity to wanting to use APL
    - Installing a modified APL character EPROM broke applications that relied on the characters 
      in the character table that were replaced (mostly characters you could use for basic drawing on a terminal)
    - APL was very much limited to those who absolutely-positively had to have it
    - That meant academia and very niche applications (financials)
    - Widespread adoption was pretty much impossible
</code></pre>
It is in that context that Iverson thought-up the idea of transliterating APL symbols into combinations of ASCII characters.  It was a failed attempt to make things more accessible to the masses by compromising the very foundation of APL.  This was very short-sighted.  Computers evolved very quickly and very soon both displaying and printing APL characters was within the reach of any 15 year old with a computer.<p>And it was a failure.  Not the least of the reasons for this being that, to the average person, J code looks like ASCII vomit.  APL has distinct symbols, just like mathematics.  One might not be able to understand the code but the end product not only looks very different from ASCII vomit, it is.  Because notation has power.<p>The correct path would have been to understand technology would catch-up to the requirements of APL and focus on extending and improving the language.  A simple example of this would be adding an object-oriented programming layer to the language.  Compilation and distribution through executable files and (civilian) installation packages, which are valuable for commercial closed-source security and deployment, would also have been a valuable add-ons.  I was working with Assembler, FORTH, C, and C++ at the same time I worked with APL.  I could deliver executable user-installable programs in any of those languages --and sell them!-- while my use of APL was limited to a range between academic and internal tools.  It would have been brilliant to have been able to deliver finished user applications indistinguishable (by the user) from those written in C or C++.  That was impossible.  They should have worked on that, and more.<p>Frankly, I have been wishing, for decades now, for someone to stand on the shoulders of APL and develop it&#x27;s successor.  A rich SYMBOLIC language capable of allowing rich and effortless expression of ideas at an entirely different level of thought and abstraction than for-loops and indenting lines by four spaces.<p>Anyhow, it&#x27;s a soapbox.  I know.  Getting off it.  I need to go do some useful work.<p>[0] <a href=""http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.eecg.toronto.edu&#x2F;~jzhu&#x2F;csc326&#x2F;readings&#x2F;iverson.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.eecg.toronto.edu&#x2F;~jzhu&#x2F;csc326&#x2F;readings&#x2F;iverson.pd...</a>"

A few years ago a Chinese man on the BART tried asking me for directions. His english was poor. With the aid of google translate we were able to do some basic communication. Over the course of 10 minutes I learned he was trying to visit the Wikipedia headquarters. I mentioned I was surprised he could access Wikipedia in the mainland. He told me that many know how to access Wikipedia.<p>Let&#x27;s be clear. Authoritarianism is not culture; it is an evil political ideology that the people of China are subjected to.
"I don’t know about <i>Dory</i> and <i>Nemo</i>, given the incredible range and quantity of distractors in this day and age (which of the dozen movies that came out this week will you take direction from today?), but I know in the past the <i>Lassie</i> problem was both real and long-lived (from anecdotal discussions with animal welfare experts).<p>But that doesn’t take away from the point of this research and I don’t disagree with it. Movies like <i>Free Willy</i>, <i>Rio</i>, <i>Balto</i>, <i>Fly Away Home</i>, and so many others have definitely worked miracles for turning apathetic (or rather, directionless) children into compassionate adults that care about the plight of the animals we share this world with."
"They contacted me for a Software Engineer position, 2 months back by them.

"Strange coincidence this appears on the front page, as I have been having system instability with freezes, and my hunch is that it&#x27;s something with the QT library.

"I&#x27;m wary about git restore --staged. It seems backwards to have a destructive (worktree-modifying) command become non-destructive by adding a flag. To me, this appears more footgun-prone than git reset, which defaults to non-destructive behaviour and requires the ominous --hard flag in order to become destructive.<p>So I will probably avoid both git restore --staged and git reset --hard (and suggest to others to do the same). I hope git status will keep the hint to use git reset to unstage, even after git-restore becomes stable."

"I gave up on Julia at 0.6 for these reasons a couple of years ago, before giving it another try at 1.1<p>Unfortunately, while the startup time has improved, I still find the JIT compiler overhead makes it unsuitable for most shorter scripts - the sort of thing where I would normally use python or R. Taking a few minutes to produce the first plot of the day while julia recompiles the plotting packages dependency tree is just a pain.<p>Edit: 
After a fresh install of 1.1, I found loading the Plotly package takes 4 seconds from a fresh repl, while the first plot with the Plotly.jl backend (plot(rand(5,5),linewidth=2,title=&quot;My Plot&quot;)) takes 14s, and subsequent plots take less than 1s on my computer. This is a marked improvement on 0.6, which is where my few minutes came from. Couldn&#x27;t get PyPlot to work."

"As someone who has followed the constructed language and international auxiliary language community for a couple of decades, and as someone with an undergraduate degree in linguistics, I do not see a constructed language catching on with the mainstream public any time soon.<p>A constructed language is a language that someone sits down and creates; this is different from a natural language which just forms as people communicate with each other.  There are many constructed languages: Klingon in Star Trek is an actual constructed language, as is the language the Elves spoke in The Lord of the Rings.<p>Esperanto, and Interslavic, are examples of <i>International Auxiliary Languages</i> (IAL), languages specially made to be easy to learn to facilitate international communication.  We have had those languages for well over a century, and none of them have caught on.<p>The reason why an IAL has not caught on is because people are motivated to learn a language when it has prestige, not because it’s easier to learn.  Right now, for better or for worse, English is that language (with all of its warts: Auxiliary words to carry tense, the rather strange tense&#x2F;lax vowel distinction, etc.) right now.<p>I would love to see an IAL to catch on, but there’s a serious marketing issue, especially since a lot of people just don’t have the mind to learn a new language as an adult, no matter how easy the language is to learn."

Are there any real use case for GPT-2? Does it solve any problem?
I&#x27;ve read almost all state of the art leaderboards of all Nlp tasks of paperswithcode.com and truth is except text generation, openAI has not one state of the art, they are not even visible in leaderboards. 
OpenAI is maybe the AI research center with the biggest funding and comparatively to other well known (Microsoft, Facebook, Google or even zalando..) they are the ones with the least results.<p>From my observations most SOTAs come from chineses researchers by far, followed by deepmind.<p>BTW isn&#x27;t that a sad truth that not even one of all major AI actors has a draft of an AGI architecture, something comparable to CYC or opencog.

Many important NLP tasks have almost nobody publicly working on them it seems, on paperswithcode.com or NLP-progress (from github) some tasks have only one or two papers...
And many others have not evolved since 2016. 
Most of the time it seems trivial to beat the old state of the art, just use BERT or XLnet on a task where nobody applied it before and hop, free state of the art for you! Yet researchers don&#x27;t seems to chase those low hanging, high returns fruits.
Also researchers seems to work a lot in isolation, many new generic improvements like new optimizers (RAdam for example) and new activation functions (Swish) allow to beat most of older state of the art on almost all task just by using them. 
Yet researchers will take years before using them because of an absurd inertia.
Also unlike an open source program, BERT and XLnet have very low response and activity on github despite major open issues...

"Hi HN, I’m Soham Sankaran, the founder of Pashi, the company behind Saag as a Service (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;saag.pashi.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;saag.pashi.com</a>). We offer three macronutrient-portioned variants of Saag (delicately-spiced Indian spinach curry): High Fat Saag Paneer, Balanced Saag Tofu, and High Protein Saag Seitan. We currently deliver weekly to customers in the SF Bay Area.<p>I started this service because I’ve struggled with nutrition all my life -- with obesity, the threat of my long family history of diabetes, and with getting adequate protein as a vegetarian in the United States. I’ve never had the time to consistently cook all my meals, and it’s hard to know the nutritional value of food you’re getting at restaurants unless you stick to salads or chain fast food (which is required to have nutritional information but is routinely off by 20-40%). Even if you know the nutritional values of the food you’re eating, attempting to log all your meals and snacks in a journal or an app like MyFitnessPal can be a massive time-sink and mental load.<p>‘Complete nutrition’ products like Soylent and Huel were appealing for relieving the physical and cognitive burden of dealing with nutrition all the time, but I perceived two major issues with them:<p>1) They taste absolutely terrible. These products are a massive step backward from thousands of years of accumulated culinary experience, and I don’t believe that most people are willing to forgo the pleasure that comes from eating real food three times a day, even if some kind of meal replacement is the right choice for their health. The biggest issue with diet plans and nutrition studies of all kinds is pervasively low adherence -- it just isn’t possible to get most people to consistently eat food that doesn’t taste good.<p>2) The retail versions of these products are not particularly customizable. Different people have different nutritional needs -- certainly calorically, but also in terms of macronutrient proportions. A female weightlifter and a male endurance runner have different bodies and different goals, resulting in different optimal nutritional profiles. Feeding them the same one-size-fits-all meal replacement is a mistake.<p>I stated Pashi to provide a real-food based nutrition service that tastes great but still retains the desirable characteristics of things like Soylent. The long term vision is to usher in a world where people can eat real, tasty food that is seamlessly customized to the specific nutritional profile they desire.<p>I initially soft-launched Pashi as a producer of entire meals with fully customizable calorie counts and macronutrient proportions, but this seemed to confuse people and didn&#x27;t get very much traction. As a result, we’ve scaled back the focus to one of the most popular, customizable, and easily explainable foods on our menu -- Saag. If this gets some traction, we’ll introduce more fine-grained nutritional customization and more menu items depending on the feedback we get from our users.<p>I’d love to get the community’s thoughts on this and answer any questions here or via email (soham@pashi.com)."

"Interestingly the article on the bottom links to a Usenix 2019 (held Aug 14 - 16) paper with the title &quot;A Billion Open Interfaces for Eve and Mallory: MitM, DoS, and Tracking Attacks on iOS and macOS Through Apple Wireless Direct Link&quot;<p>Abstract:<p>&quot;Apple Wireless Direct Link (AWDL) is a key protocol in Apple&#x27;s ecosystem used by over one billion iOS and macOS devices for device-to-device communications. AWDL is a proprietary extension of the IEEE 802.11 (Wi-Fi) standard and integrates with Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) for providing services such as Apple AirDrop. We conduct the first security and privacy analysis of AWDL and its integration with BLE. We uncover several security and privacy vulnerabilities ranging from design flaws to implementation bugs leading to a man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack enabling stealthy modification of files transmitted via AirDrop, denial-of-service (DoS) attacks preventing communication, privacy leaks that enable user identification and long-term tracking undermining MAC address randomization, and DoS attacks enabling targeted or simultaneous crashing of all neighboring devices. The flaws span across AirDrop&#x27;s BLE discovery mechanism, AWDL synchronization, UI design, and Wi-Fi driver implementation. Our analysis is based on a combination of reverse engineering of protocols and code supported by analyzing patents.

"I found the interview hard to follow, so I&#x27;ll just focus on a few bits.<p>I disagree with the idea that mathematics has limited computer science. I think the author has a belief that mathematics is a one-way street: you can use mathematics but you can&#x27;t create it. This is not the case. He&#x27;s correct the standard mathematics (say, undergraduate level engineering mathematics) doesn&#x27;t model changes over time and other things that are interesting about computer systems, but this doesn&#x27;t mean that new mathematics that does model these things cannot be created (and they have). It&#x27;s also important to realise the practical limits of maths. Unless you&#x27;re a pure mathematician you don&#x27;t create maths for the hell of it---you create it to answer some question (what is the runtime of this code? Is it memory-safe?) Modelling everything is hard so you only model enough to answer the question of interest.<p>I agree that there is an artistic aspect to programming, and I can think of two interesting applications to this. Firstly is to study programming as an art, and this is something the relatively new Programming journal and conference (see <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;programming-journal.org&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;programming-journal.org&#x2F;</a>) is trying to do. I think it&#x27;s early days yet and we don&#x27;t really have good vocabulary or processes for this study. The second is to use teaching techniques from art, such as studio learning, for programming. I think this could be really valuable and is very under-explored."

"Using C++ for libraries was not a bad idea but I think they got the architecture wrong. They should have used a protocol like gRPC streams or flat-buffers to communicate between core libraries and the platform UX libraries. Basically the mobile app is treated as a frontend talking to a backend using a communication protocol. You can design this to be stream-based, event-based, whatever fits the boat best. Depending on the platform, you can choose what should be part of the frontend versus what should go into the backend.<p>This is the way a lot of the big C++ mobile apps are built. Also there are lesser debugging headaches as each part can developed independently thanks to de-coupling, so you can hire native platform developers to do the job they know best without messing with C++."

"Cool! I just want to point out that the urge to generate an irregular mesh can be quite hardware unfriendly if you want to tesselate the terrain dynamically around a moving camera. The well cited papers on Geometry Clipmaps highlight this. The point is that it can be more efficient to focus on feeding the GPU pipeline in an efficient manner instead of focusing on rendering as few triangles as possible. Irregular meshes thrashes the cache if you retriangulate them all the time (since no data can be reused). A uniform grid has many advantages, unless you&#x27;re only interested in rendering one static view, then irregular meshes are great!"

"I wonder what the modding support is going to actually be like.<p>I&#x27;m the one of the two original coauthors of the Kopernicus mod (although I handed off development of it to Dorian years ago when I got my first job after graduation because I was having trouble finding time while settling into working life). Writing that mod was already difficult as hell, because while the game supported mods, there was no SDK or any supporting documentation. There was essentially a gentleman&#x27;s agreement between the KSP modding scene and the developers that ripping apart the game assemblies for the purposes of making mods wasn&#x27;t didn&#x27;t violate the terms of service, even though it explicitly forbid such activities.<p>Building Kopernicus by spending days in the Mono .NET Assembly Decompiler figuring out how to override pieces of the game to make the custom solar systems was pretty darn fun though. I can&#x27;t tell you how much time I spent trying to figure out how to programmatically make something that PSystem.systemPrefab would accept as a Unity Prefab object. Or the fun of learning about attributes in .NET to build a reflection based configuration system that would actually process KSP&#x27;s configuration file format into said systemPrefab object.<p>One of the things that the modding community felt at the time was that as Take-Two starting getting more aggressive about hiding the way the internals of the game worked (it&#x27;s very murky if said gentleman&#x27;s agreement is still in place), and in it&#x27;s place producing some documentation, that the way forward may be just making an open source KSP-style game with original content and a completely different engine as to avoid any legal problems (we&#x27;d all seen how the internals of KSP worked, so we needed to make sure to do ours entirely differently). But no one (including myself) really ever found the time to work on it or made a serious effort to do so...<p>If they solved the performance issues with large ships, and have somewhat more realistic physics (e.g. Lagrange points&#x2F;Parking orbits are impossible in KSP), that may just be cause to drop the idea completely. I&#x27;ve mainly found my time spent exploring the depths of orbital integrators, Eric Bruneton&#x27;s atmosphere paper, and Vulkan."

I also wonder how many studies have been conducted and for how many years.<p>For those of you who want an actual evidence-based practice check out Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR).  It&#x27;s the most frequently studied protocol and it&#x27;s been studied for decades.  When you read stories about studies showing how meditation does XYZ and ABC, it&#x27;s almost always MBSR that the researchers are using.<p>&quot;Meditation&quot; is a huge category, there&#x27;s a lot of stuff in there.

The assumption behind these is that with knowledge of, say, 90% of the vocabulary you encounter, you will comprehend 90% of the writings you encounter. It doesn&#x27;t work out at all that way, though, because it is generally the low frequency vocabulary that carries the key information in a text and on which the interpretation of everything else hinges."

"Taxing businesses at all has been objected to as double taxation: the business is taxed, then the residual profits are distributed to shareholders, who are taxed. It isn&#x27;t a fringe idea: in 2015, many of the Republican candidates in the running for President stated they thought making corporate tax rates 0% would not only &quot;boost the economy&quot;, it would essentially remove all tax laws from the books, greatly simplifying things.<p>Superficially it sounds reasonable. But it isn&#x27;t. The US military spends $700B+ every year, often times very pointedly protecting the interests of US businesses. The state department has untold people spending billions more opening markets and making trade favorable for US businesses. By and large, the benefits to individuals is an afterthought -- what is good for US business is good for US citizens is the thinking.  Large swaths of the government function is spent optimizing conditions for business activity.<p>So, to get to the point: why should I pay higher tax to protect the business interests of Grumman, and GE, and farmers, and Apple, etc? Apple derives far more benefit and far more directly than I do.  Why aren&#x27;t they paying their portion of the taxes to support it? If part of the cost of doing business is running overseas bases so we can exert influence, that cost should be built into the business expenses as taxes, instead of being externalized to John Q. Public.<p>The answer is, of course, the super wealthy have captured government and a large part of the media which promotes their interests."

It&#x27;s also really great if I want to go off on a road trip or something. I&#x27;d like a bit of diversity in the types of problems I&#x27;m working on, and miss building something up with people who have different skills or knowledge than me. So I&#x27;m looking for work that&#x27;s at least partly onsite, but that lets me do whatever I want to isolate myself and work through a problem on my own if necessary (in Vancouver if anyone&#x27;s looking). At a previous position, eyebrows were raised when I chose to take my laptop away from my desk to sit in the lobby and code so I could get away from Bill, the jackass who brought in a mechanical keyboard and screamed through sales calls on his bluetooth earpiece. Bill, of course wasn&#x27;t a jackass. I eventually brought him aside and simply asked him to be a bit quieter."

"The GOP direction has been to break the IRS since the 90s. None of the administrations were willing or able to take a stand against it, and this administration is actively trying to break the executive branch overall.<p>A good friend was a specialist in a few tax evasion schemes used by real estate developers and a few other more obscure areas with similar methods. Basically, there were about 50 people nationally doing this in the early 90s, but the program was defunded over time and when he retired, there were 4. He spent about 60% of his time flying all over the country to testifying in court. Today there is nobody, the last guy retired last year.<p>By my friend&#x27;s reckoning, his direct work accounted for $100M in recovered revenue per year. Some big cases were multiples of that. They have models that show the deterrent effect that enforcement has -- that $100M in recovery may deter $1B in undetected fraud. That is money being stolen from the treasury."

Here is the underlying article, which will be published this year but was actually received in September 2016: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ntanet.org&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;proceedings&#x2F;2016&#x2F;158-nessa-schwab-stomberg-towery-irs-resources-paper.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ntanet.org&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;proceedings&#x2F;2016&#x2F;1...</a> (follow the link in the article, which lists the receive date as September 30, 2016).<p>The article mentions the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (Trump&#x27;s tax cuts). But the IRS budget cuts discussed in the article are actually from 2015, stemming from the kerfuffle over the IRS allegedly targeting conservative groups for increased scrutiny.<p>Separately, the article fails to address the nature of the additional revenue that could hypothetically have been collected. Pages 26-27 of the article address the study&#x27;s finding that &quot;the IRS collects a larger portion of proposed deficiencies when it has fewer resources.&quot; In the authors&#x27; view, that could be because &quot;the IRS focuses on weaker taxpayer positions when its resources are limited.&quot; In other words, a larger enforcement budget leads the IRS to go after cases where the IRS is less certain it will win because the facts are more debatable. The authors do not assess the merits of those cases or whether it would be socially desirable to pursue them."
"It should be noted that a central bank with a floating currency is constrained in its control of interest rates the more it controls foreign exchange and vice versa.<p>Using tariffs to constrain the actions of foreign central banks is really quite interesting.

"I started out my career as a 19 year old in business intelligence and old school data warehousing, and only in the last three years been able to properly apply my skills in the world of big data as a data engineer, and I&#x27;ve found that regardless of the fancy titles the kind of stuff I do is exactly the same. Perhaps the most surprising thing is that because &quot;data engineering&quot; is disassociated from the notion of traditional warehousing, you get lots of &quot;experts&quot; who have never heard of an ETL and think about software instead of data pipelines.<p>And with data scientists, I&#x27;ve found that it&#x27;s a mix of a) people who did mathematics or physics degrees suddenly getting into computer science b) senior analysts learning how to power up their analysis and c) computer science graduates who went on to do phd in data science<p>Working with them my humble opinion is that a) you can&#x27;t ignore the software aspect of your job, meaning that you need to understand basic database principles, parallel computing, SQL, etc. b) you also need to understand that it&#x27;s not about how fancy your algorithm is, but also how it can be quantified, how you can manage the life cycle, how you maintain it, etc."
"I suppose you could saw that parsing <i>any</i> text-based protocol in general &quot;Is a Minefield&quot;. They look so simple and &quot;readable&quot;, which is why they&#x27;re appealing initially, but parsing text always involves lots of corner-cases and I&#x27;ve always thought it a huge waste of resources to use text-based protocols for data that&#x27;s not actually meant for human consumption the vast majority of the time.<p>Consider something as simple as parsing an integer in a text-based format; there may be whitespace to skip, an optional sign character, and then a loop to accumulate digits and convert them (itself a subtraction, multiply, and add), and there&#x27;s still the questions of all the invalid cases and what they should do.

"This article hits close to home. I&#x27;ve been working with Xamarin for almost two years now. It has done its job and provided a quick avenue to prototype a concept and deliver a product. However, as the article mentions, the maintenance is a bear. Here are some of the issues I face:<p>- The developer experience is awful. Visual Studio for Mac causes so many issues (crashes, mangled project files) it hinders productivity. About once every two weeks I spend half a day wrestling with a VS issue.<p>- As AirBnB&#x27;s article mentioned, to be effective in cross-platform development, you need to know three platforms well which is a difficult task.<p>- Xamarin&#x27;s performance on Android has notoriously been poor and only has marginally improved. Try using a Xamarin app on a cheaper Android device or an older version of Android.<p>- No mobile engineers want to work on Xamarin.<p>That said, the good news about working with Xamarin is that it exposed me to C# and the .NET ecosystem.

"Great job to the founders, awesome to see more cool companies out of the UW nano program.<p>Curious why all the negativity, perhaps people are unaware that cannabis actively DOES impair driving to dangerous levels.

A zero tolerance policy for smoking + driving within <i>days</i> is unreasonable and thus will be ineffective. This device and the research behind it looks like could help regulators and police catch people who are dangerously high while not arresting those who happened to smoke much earlier."

In particular, its location support is awful -- a good dive app really should be built around a central dive site database so that the dive app becomes useful not just after a dive (to log your dive) but also before (to read about the under- and over-water geography, local wildlife, etc.).

For iOS it uses RoboVM, and for the web export it uses GWT to compile to JavaScript.<p>Obviously this is best suited for custom UIs (like games), but with some frameworks on top it seems it would be possible to build a decent interface. The framework already has support for most platform specific functionality (like text input). Performance should be great because it runs close to the metal, so to speak.<p>Just curious if anyone has tried this, as I am considering the approach."

There is no proof in science and we observe it doesn&#x27;t suffer from wholesale collapse.<p>Things being proved in mathematics are unlikely to be wildly wrong even without proof. Fermat&#x27;s theorem being an example of one that took a very long time to be proved and basically nothing changed when it was. We were already convinced it was true by brute force failure to find a counter example. This lack of proof but search for counter-example is basically the scientific method. Is A equivalent to B? Prove it? Or write a for-loop and test it for values you care about. If you think you&#x27;ve proved it you probably write the for loop anyway (where such a thing is feasible).<p>So do we actually &#x2F;need&#x2F; proof in math at all or is it just good fun and properly satisfying for mathematicians? Perhaps these are two extremes and case-by-case we could plot them somehwere between the two. Some right up hard against one side or the other.<p>So is P=NP? There is no proof. You probably aren&#x27;t going out on a massive limb to have a view on the matter without it.

"The issue is, I think most people (myself included) enter YAML into their lives as basically a JSON alternative with lighter syntax.

Neither?<p>- what version of Swagger or OpenAPI are you using?<p>- etc.<p>Sure, it&#x27;s great to see ongoing development of schemas, but with each new development we have yet another dialect to consider&#x2F;support.<p>In my view, perhaps an even greater problem with structured data formats in general is the void that separates them from programming languages esp. static languages such as Java where static type information is otherwise leveraged. The industry standard solution, code generation, is awful in almost every respect. The Manifold framework looks promising in this regard (<a href=""http:&#x2F;&#x2F;manifold.systems&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;manifold.systems&#x2F;</a>)."
"JSON sucks. Maybe half our REST bugs are directly related to JSON parsing.<p>Is that a long or an int? Boolean or the string &quot;true&quot;? Does my library include undefined properties in the JSON? How should I encode and decode this binary blob?<p>We tried using OpenApi specs on the server and generators to build the clients. In general, the generators are buggy as hell. We eventually gave up as about 1&#x2F;4 of the endpoints generated directly from our server code didn&#x27;t work. One look at a spec doc will tell you the complexity is just too high.<p>We are moving to gRPC. It just works, and takes all the fiddling out of HTTP. It saves us from dev slap fights over stupid cruft like whether an endpoint should be PUT or POST. And saves us a massive amount of time making all those decisions."

"IRS budget cuts seem to be thrown around a lot, but to me this is just a symptom of the real problem -- a tax code that is way too complex. Years of congress pandering to special interests, fixing minor issues with pages of new tax rules and no implementation accountability (implementation and enforcement is dumped on IRS) brought US tax code to a state that can overwhelm any staffing levels.<p>Simplifying tax code will go much further than trying to staff up IRS.

"Ah, saag. The marvellous old world Punjabi food without the use of tomato, potato etc. My grandma used to have proper procedure for saag. Let mustard grow on an untilled land, pluck the stalks and shed off the mature leaves. Take handful of stalks, make a bundle, chop them into 5 mm pieces. Put them in an earthen clay pot, just submerge the chopped stalks in water and give it a slow open flame. Season with salt. After half an hour, put common roadside ‘weeds’ baathoo, chilayi, spinach. Let it boil for another half an hour. Take the pot off, put handful of maize flour and blend the mixture halfway. Use more maize flour as required, saag should acquire a non-liquid appearance. Serve it in a bowl, with churned raw milk butter. Maize flour roti or ‘tortilla’. And lassi, which is just the by-product of milk churning process.<p>The only old world, pre-wheat Punjabi main course meal that is seriously tasty.

"This is an awesome analysis of the situation.  Some things I have noticed as a data scientist of 4 years so far:
- Increasingly, data scientist is just being used in place of senior analyst because it attracts more applications.
- At the firms I&#x27;ve worked that are software tech companies, there was an outsized interest in mid-level software engineers wanting to be data scientists, mostly because the career development prospects at that stage are grim and data science usually means a pay bump.  This demand has had the opposite effect - software shops are leery of promoting engineers to data scientists for fear of inciting contention among the ranks.
- Building on the data scientist usually means senior analyst, it has also come to mean analyst that can build their sql query into a scheduled ETL or daily process of some sort.  You work in pandas instead of excel sorta thing.
- I have personally gotten all my data science jobs from talking about the business side of things.  I think engineers approaching the field from a hard-skills perspective is totally wrong.  My last technical take home was in a language I had never used before and likewise my execution was shitty, but I was able to well explain the problem, how the data could be used to predict the variation, and how the data science product fit into the business.  I got an offer before I left the building."

"I&#x27;m a deer hunter.  I&#x27;m out in the woods scouting a few times in the late summer, then I&#x27;m out there every day in the fall for about two months.<p>I treat everything with permethrine:  clothes, socks, boots, hats, orange vest, backpack, ground blind, even the tripod chair I sit on in the blind.  Permethrine, derived from the chrysanthemum flower, kills ticks (as well as ants and bees).  If one lands on your pants or shirt, it will quickly die.  But permethrine is considered harmless to mammals once it&#x27;s dry.  It also doesn&#x27;t hurt to spray some deet on your exposed skin (face, hands etc.).  Permethrine survives several washings.<p>As soon as I come back from a hunt, I strip and take a hot scrub shower.  This is probably the best way to rid them from your body before they latch on, which usually takes a few hours up to 24 or so before they settle in a desirable spot.<p>Reducing the deer population is an excellent way to reduce the adult tick vector; deer can travel quite far and spread tick populations quickly.<p>The nymph phase of the tick life cycle is slightly different; they are on mice and other rodents until they reach a certain size.  You can actually reduce this population by putting out tick tubes everywhere in your yard, under brush, under wood piles, wherever rodents might tend to go.  The tubes contain cotton or dryer lint sprayed with permethrine; the rodents take bits of the material back to line their nests, and it kills the baby ticks.  I do this every spring, in the hopes it will rid the vicinity of many ticks.<p>Lyme is serious business and once you get it, it can take years if not forever to get rid of.  Lymerix was a vaccine developed in the 1990s that was about 80% effective, but unfortunately an anti-vaccine group sued the company successfully and they pulled it off the market.  The CDC subsequently determined there was no validity to the plaintiff&#x27;s claims, but by then the deed was done.  Probably hundreds of thousands of people suffer from Lyme today because of this lawsuit.<p>There are new vaccines in the pipeline that sound very promising; they target common proteins among the family of Lyme bacteria (there are about a dozen known species of borrelia bacteria) so that one shot should protect you.  Of course, promising doesn&#x27;t mean guaranteed, so we&#x27;ll just have to wait and hope this thing can be beaten.<p>In the meantime, we can focus on attacking the vectors:  reduce the overpopulation of deer and rodents that carry the ticks, encourage more use of permethrine and other insecticides.  Monhegan Island, off the Maine coast, had 25% prevalence of the disease until they eradicated the deer population (originally brought there in the 1950s-60s as a tourist attraction) and new cases of Lyme went down to almost nil.<p>We can encourage more predators like hawks and owls and snakes, all of which work to keep the rodent population in check.  Flocks of birds eat ticks, but bird populations have greatly decreased in recent decades, so we might think about ways to bring them back, perhaps through reforestation and limiting exurban development that removes habitat."

"I&#x27;m going to keep saying this in every goddamn tax thread I see here - We need to switch around the way we are taxing from the US level getting the largest pie to the state. I&#x27;m not saying I figured it out - but right now there are enormous issues with the way we tax.<p>1. We have a system where the fed. government holds states hostage for money when it wants to bully things around. (emergencies, etc..).<p>2. The current system is actively encouraging people to domicile in TX, FL, WA, SD, etc... (income tax free states) and not actually live there, hoping to play the tax lottery (or move around so much they can&#x27;t be convicted).<p>3. The &quot;sales tax&quot; system in the US is ridiculous. It&#x27;s egregiously illegal according to our tax-once rule. If we can get a tax break on all sales tax we paid, that would be one thing, but we can&#x27;t.<p>4. Ind. contractors are taxed in extremely unfair ways, often have no recourse to get discounts or tax breaks on health insurance.<p>My solution -<p>I say it&#x27;s time to start having states collect that 25% and the feds are hands-off of taxing individuals. Beyond that it would make sense for people to declare a state of residence (one that they most want roads repaired at, police hired, etc..). Get rid of sales tax completely - it&#x27;s a massive waste of time if states are getting a fair amount. Move MOST fed employees to the state level and remove major govt. contractors that are bilking the public (in the long run companies like Northrup Gruman etc.. are paying the heads billions each - there&#x27;s no oversight.). Remove the national army and start creating state-armies. Re-write the constitution that changes how states operate within the federal level, and completely change the role of the federal government to be allowed to make laws that are scoped towards fairness across states. Make the fed. government in charge of analytics and cross-state environmental regulation. States would then have the right to make laws that apply to the people.<p>Some might say this is ridiculous but in a time where we getting to the &quot;end of capitalism&quot; a MASSIVE re-write to how money is moved around is damn fucking necessary."

"I believe performance does matter and should factor into the design of a system. There is an ISO guidelines on software system requirements and specifications that has a section for performance requirements. It does matter even for banal, non-critical or non-life-threatening software systems.<p>Another often-overlooked requirement: environment. Does the human using your software system have to pay attention to more important situations around them? Is the environment they&#x27;re using your software in noisy, stressful, dangerous or dirty? Should you expect frequent wireless interference or degraded wireless performance?<p>Reading the ISO specs are pretty boring, so is the SWEBOK guide, but it&#x27;s rather interesting to think about software in terms of the whole system and not as an artifact unto itself."

"gcc has some attributes to help with that, for example try __attribute__((pure)) on funcs that will always return the same thing for the same inputs (given the same global state) and do not modify said input or state (and thus can be called more or fewer times than programmer wrote). Usually gcc will be quite aggressive with optimizations if you use that.<p>For even more aggressiveness, try __attribute__((const)) which tells it that the func accesses NOTHING but the params, not even global vars. Of course this is quite limiting. You can also use this as a trick when <i>YOU</i> know that the only accessed global state is itself constant but gcc does not know that. This can produce substantial savings in number of calls of funcs that, for example, do lookups in large constant data tables, like table-based versions of sin() and cos().<p>In the example the article gives, adding __attribute__((pure)) to constFunc() does produce the  behaviour author wanted and then some<p>LWN has more: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lwn.net&#x2F;Articles&#x2F;285332&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lwn.net&#x2F;Articles&#x2F;285332&#x2F;</a>"

"Thanks for posting this.  One thing that I think really helps me is to have a reason for everything I do, better than pleasure&#x2F;power&#x2F;attention&#x2F;toys, that is relevant to both the long-term and the short-term.  So I know why, and that motivates me.  One problem I might have had is too much motivation and I have had to adjust, to re-balance.<p>I have decided that direction is more important than speed.  I.e., making sure the ladder of success is not leaning against the wrong wall (Covey), and that we are not running in circles, or spending our lifetime on mere shiny things.  What do we want to look back on after decades, or at the end of mortality?  I.e., good decision-making, keeping in mind the purpose of one&#x27;s life.  My purpose in life comes from my beliefs, but I think a next candidate for purpose could be joy, which I suppose comes from knowing one&#x27;s nature, and from learning&#x2F;growth, and unselfish service to others (helping them learn and grow and be well &amp; happy).<p>So, balance while moving forward well, based the above, to me is much more important than getting <i>more</i> tasks done (though I am very task-focused when I am able, because the tasks relate directly to the purpose and related specific goals).  This and other things help me feel peaceful and happy (life and learning are very much a work in progress, but some things I have gratefully learned).<p>I have written more at <a href=""http:&#x2F;&#x2F;lukecall.net"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;lukecall.net</a> (a lightly-loading, simple site), including about development of and candidate content for maturity models for different areas of life (mental, physical, social, spiritual).    Feedback welcome."
"The use of &quot;obsessed&quot; is a pretty aggressive conclusion - just because people do something a lot doesn&#x27;t mean they&#x27;re obsessed. I&#x27;m not obsessed with laundry and vacuuming because I have a dog that sheds a lot.<p>When I was a kid, my grandma was in a retirement home, and every time I&#x27;d go over, she&#x27;d have the TV on and blasting at full volume. She wasn&#x27;t obsessed, there just wasn&#x27;t much else she could do. She was in bad physical shape, so she couldn&#x27;t leave her room easily. Her eyes were bad, so she couldn&#x27;t read or engage in a lot of other activities. Her options were the TV or talking to her kids on the phone, and you can only do the latter for so many hours a week.<p>Millennials&#x2F;teens&#x2F;whatever group of young people you want to compare them to are more physically fit and able to get around, plus they have larger social networks. That enables them to do a much broader range of activities than the elderly, so of course it&#x27;s likely they&#x27;ll divide their time among more things than the elderly will."

"This article has some interesting tips and useful encouragement but the system it outlines has a glaring hole: there is no objective feedback loop based upon <i>outcomes</i> back to the interviewer.  The author appears to encourage that interviewers seek feedback, but the message is not to look for data but <i>sentiment</i>:<p>“One way you can tell you’re proficient is that recruiters and hiring managers try to find ways to include you in their interview loops because they know you’ll both get the candidate excited and be able to assess their work fairly, even if they take an unusual approach.”<p>If recruiters and hiring managers want you on a panel, it signals that you’re unlikely to disrupt their pipelines by rejecting candidates.  This is especially true for high-growth companies (e.g. Twitter where ICs would do 8 onsites a week; I did 5 per week for years).  They like you not because you’re proficient but because you’re aligned.<p>Is it possible to be aligned and “wrong” ? Of course!  Invariably, gluttonous hiring practices result in the need for “bar raisers” to restore consistency, entire teams with no real focus, and an explosion of communication channels.  Hypergrowth is cancerous.  And if everybody is in it together, nobody will be hold another accountable.<p>This article outlines very little about proficiency and a lot about how to brainwash new grads into believing alignment itself with a recruiting process is a very special skill.  Seek evidence about real outcomes instead.  Do your own critical thinking."

"As a Fulani, when I was growing up there weren&#x27;t any official alphabet. Some people wrote in Arabic, other&#x27;s in the latin letters using french phonetics and agreed upon combinations for those new sounds. (ie Bhe, dhe, etc.) I only know Fulani orally.<p>But around 2002, if I remember correctly, Guinean students from the University of Azhar in Egypt, started working on a new alphabet. They agreed on using latin letters for familiar sounds, since most of Fulanis speak french anyway. They added new letters for those particularly Fulani sounds.<p>I remember being there in a small college bedroom where they were all gathered around the computer. It had a Pentium III and they were excited about a new Pentium 4 machine that someone had donated but they didn&#x27;t get the chance to install it yet. I don&#x27;t remember if the two brothers were there since those names are extremely common for Fulani (yes, my name is Ibrahima too).<p>I was there to get a hair cut, and along the way they told me the computer had issues. All I did was go to windows Registry, and delete the files that automatically started at boot.<p>The script in this article is new to me, never saw it before. I read books in the one they made in Egypt, since it&#x27;s easy to pick up. In fact, I think when you take an official test in Fulani, it is written in the script from Egypt.<p>Either way, I&#x27;m excited for this and hopefully I&#x27;ll get to learn it quick enough to teach my own children."

"Autism is called a disorder, but I think that that&#x27;s a pretty negative term for it. People with autism may be a minority, and that makes the condition abnormal, but in itself autism isn&#x27;t a bad thing; it&#x27;s how they relate to the world that make autism &quot;bad.&quot; Instead autism is merely different.<p>I think we can treat autism like any other subject. For example, some children start reading earlier than others, and other than extreme cases we don&#x27;t say that they have a reading disorder. We simply recognize that some people have more difficulty than others learning to read. Can we do the same with social skills? Simply have a dedicated class with structured learning, and recognize that not everyone learns social cues at the same rate?"

"&quot;Why would you care what order we were sending the name value pairs for this?&quot; The article makes it sound like it&#x27;s somehow IBM&#x27;s fault. However, questions about preserving order in hashes&#x2F;associative arrays&#x2F;maps&#x2F;whatchamacallit span at least thirty years. Some applications of the format even demand it (e.g. ansible uses YAML - a superset of JSON - or even straight JSON for it playbooks; emitting them out of order is not an option).<p>Every time the issue surfaces it elicits a large amount of eye rolling among the cognoscenti. However, I&#x27;m a firm believer in the idea that recurring demands from the user base need to be addressed, rather then mocked. The coding community appears to me notably tone deaf on this.<p>&#x27;Course anybody can use &lt;insert suitable technique&gt; to send a JSON map in the desired order, except the parser on the other hand will blissfully disregard it. Or you can devise any ordered solution on both ends, which will leave you outside of the accepted standard and open you up to the situation described in the article (where the requirement may well have been frivolous).<p>I can remember very few - if any - instances of somebody implying that the standard should somehow make room for this kind of scenarios. The standard reply was &quot;use a different format&quot; or &quot;change the requirement&quot;.

"From the article: &quot;People with Asperger’s syndrome, the term still commonly used for one of the most well-known forms of autism spectrum disorder, bring serious advantages to the financial markets: extreme focus, a facility with numbers, a willingness to consider unpopular opinions, a strong sense of logic, and an intense belief in fairness and justice. But, like other autistic employees, they often feel alienated from their managers, colleagues, and clients. Sometimes they simply get fired.&quot;<p>I wonder if these people were always fired, or has something in the business changed that made immoderate instances of these traits a liability? Tech has changed in the last decade, to where I don&#x27;t think someone &quot;on the spectrum,&quot; could survive very long in a west coast company without being preyed upon by people who trade on other attributes.<p>Using Pfeffer&#x27;s triad of &quot;Performance, Credentials, Relationships,&quot; businesses seem to evolve to where success becomes weighted to the latter two instead of purely on performance. Arbitrage, startups, and other asymmetric, high risk plays could seem to benefit from high performing people on the spectrum, where people in later stage businesses that have more linear growth or stability benefit from the latter two.<p>To me, the trouble with the most functional edge of the &quot;spectum,&quot; view as presented is it seems to both normalize groupthink and some of the more shameful characteristics of political operators, and pathologizes clear reasoning and principle.<p>I get that expecting others to be accountable to my or any other general ethical rules is to choose suffering, but the tendency to pseudo-medicalize people as &quot;on the spectrum,&quot;  who lose politically feels ominous."

"Major respect to Stripe for starting this program, as this helps solve a real problem in the carbon dioxide removal (CDR) field. At Project Vesta (thanks for the shoutout[1]), while we have a plan for individuals to pay for their CO2 removal by donating directly for a specific tonnage of olivine to be placed on a beach in their name, all of the investors&#x2F;fund advisors who have approached us and are interested in getting into the CDR field, have generally been limited in that they can only make investments into an organization if there is a way to get a financial return. They can&#x27;t put money in non-profits, even to potentially help &quot;save the world,&quot; as they are still operating with a fiduciary responsibility and for-profit motives. If no one is paying for carbon removal, there is no business. For scientists and others trying to create carbon removal solutions, this represents a major problem, as no matter how good or cheap their CDR technique is, they also have to come up with a market of who will buy their CDR &quot;product.&quot;<p>So even though many groups&#x2F;companies want to get involved in CDR, if there is no market for paying for &quot;CDR as a product,&quot; investors will not put money in. Having Stripe and other companies guarantee payment for carbon dioxide removal would actually make a real difference in helping to spur the CDR market. Companies would be able to point at who will buy their &quot;product&quot; and at what price, and then investors would be able to invest.<p>Creating a carbon price is the most obvious and simple solution to make the &quot;free market&quot; solve a problem created by the inefficiency of the &quot;free market&quot; in the first place, of not pricing in the real world cost of the externalities from each tonne of CO2 released. The emitters should have to pay because each tonne of carbon put out into the atmosphere causes economic damage in terms of health effects and more. Some 30,000 people die prematurely in the US each year due to air pollution, yet most emitters do not pay these costs[2].<p>This is termed the &quot;social cost of carbon&quot; (SCC) and based on estimates from the U.S. governmental Interagency Working Group in 2013, each 1 metric ton of CO2 released is said to have an SCC of around $37 (2007 USD).[3] So even though there is a consensus among most scientists and economists that there should be a carbon price, and companies technically owe around $37&#x2F;tonne, no one is sure when it will occur or at what price it will be at. This uncertainty and lack of a large scale market is what prevents major private investments into large scale carbon dioxide removal (CDR) technologies.<p>It is particularly frustrating because if the free market was truly rational, polluters would be paying for the externalities on their CO2 emissions, and the CDR field would blossom. By creating a market themselves and also offering to pay at a range of prices (even though there may be cheaper options available), Stripe can help foster CDR companies when they are most vulnerable, helping them breakthrough their technological learning curves and achieve scale. At the very least, just keeping companies subsidized and advancing technologically until the world corrects this economic error, is a worthy cause.<p>Having a guaranteed CO2 removal price would allow these companies to just focus on their technology and not have to individually force the global economic system to price carbon, in order to be viable. So again, great job Stripe in starting this, and to other companies&#x2F;organizations, please start similar initiatives.<p>[1] &quot;Interesting ideas include crushing rock with natural forces&quot; [<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ProjectVesta.org"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ProjectVesta.org</a>]<p>[2] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnn.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;07&#x2F;23&#x2F;health&#x2F;air-pollution-us-deaths-study&#x2F;index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnn.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;07&#x2F;23&#x2F;health&#x2F;air-pollution-us-death...</a><p>[3] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.edf.org&#x2F;sites&#x2F;default&#x2F;files&#x2F;expertconsensusreport.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.edf.org&#x2F;sites&#x2F;default&#x2F;files&#x2F;expertconsensusrepor...</a>"

"What I hate is being lonely. They&#x27;re shutting down our offices for cost savings. As such I&#x27;ve basically been straight work from home.<p>Working from home reminds me of the isolation of being homeschooled. I love having the flexibility to work remote on certain days, for example when I need to bang out a bunch of code. But, having a place to interact with people is invaluable for me.<p>I imagine countless others feel the same way, hence why companies still see offices as having value.

"I was unfamiliar with the term roguelike. For those in the same boat, a definition from Wikipedia:<p>&quot;Roguelike is a subgenre of role-playing video game characterized by a dungeon crawl through procedurally generated levels, turn-based gameplay, tile-based graphics, and permanent death of the player character. Most roguelikes are based on a high fantasy narrative, reflecting their influence from tabletop role playing games such as Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;."

"My company is currently working to grow Asparagopsis Taxiformis, here in the US, for this purpose.<p>I agree with comments that we have big issues to tackle in regards to methane sinks failing, such as permafrost, and there are things to be said about people moving en masse to plant based diets – but, the future will always be a mix of tomorrow and today. Many people will still eat beef, and we need to ensure we reduce the negative effects of raising cattle as much as possible. We need a giant, mixed bag of tricks working in unison to slow the warming we have caused over the last 100 years.<p>Luckily, current research is showing that – not only does AT nearly eliminate methane from the bovine digestive process entirely when supplementing between half and two percent of daily diet – we are seeing early indications in research of some amazing additional benefits – improved milk production, increased immunity, improved food conversion ratio (meaning you can feed cattle less and have them pack on more protein). Studies are not finalized, but what I have heard of them sounds very, very good.<p>My background is in tech (founded and exited a TechStars company and have had a career in software and hardware startups) and my colleagues are in marine biology and phycology (algae science). My hope is that by approaching this problem from the perspective of a fast-iterating startup, we can get this product to market faster than the traditional routes of academic timelines and federal funding sources this industry is used to.<p>If you are an investor, beef serving restaurant owner, or in business related to cattle raising and finishing and would like to find out more, please email us at info+hackernews@goodalgae.com.

"Reminds me of the issue an HN poster had several months ago trying to cancel his Google Fi subscription.  Google just does not have the company culture to handle things out of the norm or the interest in developing one.  They and their customers live and die on the word of software, which for me is unacceptable.  My mission-critical providers all have a person in the loop somewhere, a human being to whom I can give our name and support account password, who can just reach right in and fix an issue no matter what the algorithm or the database says.  Computers are just too goddamn stupid sometimes.<p>Google doesn&#x27;t do that.  If they can&#x27;t automate it they won&#x27;t do it.  That works fine for being a search engine.  It doesn&#x27;t work at all for being, for instance, a telephone service provider or an ISP."

"The thing is that a lot of us saw this coming. Whenever people complain about how YouTube needs to remove X type of content, they also need to realize that if YouTube actually starts policing that type of content then there will be false positives. Since YouTube will do it algorithmically, the chance that there will be collateral damage is much higher and YouTube takes a long time to reverse decisions they&#x27;ve already made.<p>For example, YouTube doesn&#x27;t want violent content. Just having the word &quot;kill&quot; in your title can get the content demonetized, even if the content is about a video game and properly categorized as such. It&#x27;s been this way for years."

"Solar roads seem like a very expensive and thus fixed alternative, when we have a big enough expense ahead of us moving HVAC, transportation, manufacturing, etc. to green sources.

"Wondering, if there is flash memory friendly filesystem, that is actually not overwriting existing blocks until card is full, but write any changes to new memory cells, rather than overwriting existing ones.

"The big point here isn&#x27;t that these two brothers invented an alphabet — that alone isn&#x27;t that remarkable — but that it had gained so much acceptance so quickly, and that they are still here to talk to.  It sounds like writing in their language in Arabic script is still in a chaotic state where orthographic conventions have not been established, so it&#x27;s the perfect time for a natively-suited alphabet to come on the scene and take over."

So normally I read 30 to 40 % of municipal waste is organic. There is a lot of interesting work being done in accelerating that conversion to proteins and fats via insets.

"Are they trying to get ahead of government regulation with this?

"There is a persistent myth that &quot;A Haskell program that compiles is correct by definition&quot;<p>Indeed it is &quot;correct&quot; in the sense that it has a very high likelihood (maybe 90% ?) of doing what the programmer intended (Unlike say C or C++ where the probability drops to about 50% for beginners)<p>However, that is a poor definition of &quot;correct&quot;.
While it&#x27;s true that a lot of huge consequences have occurred due to stupid errors like buffer overflows (unintended bug), there are equally disastrous bugs caused by intent - i.e. the programmer had no idea the code could fail.<p>The biggest challenge to software development is not the &quot;How can I avoid silly mistakes?&quot; but rather &quot;How do I capture this extremely complicated real world semantics in code?&quot; and languages can&#x27;t really solve that"

"Writing this from an occasionally-connected hand computer in the “developing world”, <i>don&#x27;t use Encarta. Use Kiwix.</i> I have a 45000-article slice of the English Wikipedia here in 6 GB, with nearly all the pictures, and even animations and some video and audio, such as the radio broadcast of the Hindenburg crash. To give you an idea of its breadth, articles I&#x27;ve consulted recently include &quot;anal sex&quot;, &quot;rectum&quot;, &quot;convolution&quot;, &quot;ferret&quot;, &quot;Dorothy Parker&quot;, and &quot;principal component analysis&quot;. (This probably paints an unjustifiably interesting picture of my hobbies.)  The whole English Wikipedia, 4 million articles, is 35 GB without pictures.<p>(Encarta was 32000 articles and, as pointed out in <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=20741028"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=20741028</a>, ridiculously biased on some subjects, in precisely the way that Wikipedia scrupulously avoids.)<p>The biggest problem I have with Kiwix is that, on Android, its built-in downloader for ZIM files is flaky, and I haven&#x27;t figured out how to load ZIM files I downloaded in some other way yet, such as on a MicroSD card. The non-Android version works fine with such sideloaded ZIM files. (I also miss the interlanguage links; I have a few languages of Wikipedia on here, and even when I don&#x27;t it&#x27;s often useful to find out things like the Guarani word for &quot;ferret&quot;.  And of course I don&#x27;t have a local Google Search.)<p>Kiwix also has ZIM files for things like Wikisource (7.2 GB for English), Project Gutenberg (54GB for English), and Stack Overflow and other Stack Exchange sites.  The English Stack Overflow is 134 gigabytes.<p>As for the globe, a much better option than Encarta is OsmAnd~. My country is under 0.6 GB, including most of the public transit routes, down to the bus-stop level. Bonus: lat&#x2F;long links in Kiwix open in OsmAnd~.  Minus: OsmAnd~ doesn&#x27;t have any way to load satellite imagery, even the Blue Marble MODIS dataset.<p>Both Kiwix and OsmAnd~ are available on F-Droid, so you know they&#x27;re not malware.<p>But none of this is <i>interactivity</i>.  Watch Alan Kay’s talks where he talks about kids building dynamical models in Etoys to understand gravitational acceleration. Much more interesting than the Wikipedia article on convolution by itself: I have IPython, Numpy, and SciPy on my netbook, so I can create signals and kernels, convolve them, and look at the results. I can compare my own implementation of convolution to the library implementation. I can do principal component analysis with the LAPACK functions for it. <i>That&#x27;s</i> interactivity, and it&#x27;s a far more powerful learning tool than mere hypertext. And I don&#x27;t have anything like it for Android.  Is there anything?<p>An interesting thing to note about all of these — Wikipedia, OpenStreetMap, IPython, and LAPACK — is that none of them are products of capitalism.  They coexist with capitalism, but they are all products of a non-capitalist form of production, sometimes called &quot;commons-based peer production&quot;, which evidently outperforms capitalist production in certain areas just as capitalist production outperformed feudal agriculture.  The crucial question for the future of humanity, I think, is how we can extend commons-based peer production to new spheres, and the biggest obstacle seems to be artificial scarcity produced by government-granted monopolies — patent, copyright, and so on."

Alone in the Dark was very similar to an H.P. Lovecraft story and if that was what you were looking for that is what you would find. Relentless Twinsen’s Adventure was an intense fever dream of a fantasy that kept the player going on pure suspense and wonder. It had the dramatic finesse of Loom or a good sci-fi novel. When I purchased it I had only assumed it to be mindless entertainment. It turned out to be a statement on the human condition that was too valuable to let everyone know about. I diligently played it after school for many days giving the game my full attention. When I was finished I felt like I grew up a little and society at large did not let me down concerning the harsh truths revealed in this game. This is why I’ll never forget Relentless- the general malaise and apathy of the time in history it was released deeply contrasted against the wake-up call contained within the lessons of its gameplay. Both games we’re ahead of their time and technically very impressive.
Really cool project. Nice work!

Too much and news about you being a newbie will spread like wild fire and all your future discussions will drain you of even more cash in discreet envelopes. Too little money and your request will get denied making you face the same person handing over another discreet envelope, and you better have at least the correct sum in there.

"Wafer scale integration, the stupid idea that just won&#x27;t die :-)<p>Okay. I&#x27;m not quite that cynical but I was avidly following Trillogy Systems (Gene Amdahl started it to make super computers using a single wafer). Conceptually awesome, in practice not so much.<p>The thing that broke down in the &#x27;80s was that different parts of the system evolve at different rates. As a result your wafer computer was always going to be sub-optimal at something, whether it was memory access or an I&#x2F;O channel standard that was new, changing that part meant all new wafers and fab companies new that every time you change the masks, you have to re-qualify <i>everything</i>. Very time consuming.<p>I thought the AMD &quot;chiplet&quot; solution to making processors that could evolve outside the interconnect was a good engineering solution to this problem.<p>Dave Ditzel, of Transmeta fame, was pushing at one point a &#x27;stackable&#x27; chip. Sort of &#x27;chip on chip&#x27; like some cell phone SoCs have for memory, but generalized to allow more stacking than just 2 chips. The problem becomes getting the heat out of such a system as only the bottom chip is in contact with the substrate and the top chip with the case. Conceptually though, another angle where you could replace parts of the design without new masks for the other parts.<p>I really liked the SeaMicro clusters (tried to buy one at the previous company but it was too far off axis to pass the toy vs tool test).

"Part of the abstract at the bottom:<p>&quot;The proposed algorithm can be quickly described as an iterative algorithm that treats color information as a heightmap and &#x27;pushes&#x27; pixels towards probable edges using gradient-ascent.

VDSR[1], waifu2x[2]).&quot;<p>This is interesting to me because it hints at the direction I really want to see ML stuff go.<p>Some problems may not lend themselves to this concept, but hear me out: We train models, they start giving reliable output, then we put it in production really having no idea what the thing is doing inside.  Here we have a traditional image processing algorithm that&#x27;s doing something similar to what the author suspects the ML-based solution is doing... only the authors solution is much more performant.  What I think we&#x27;d love to see is the ML approach yield a result that not only works, but is transparent in how it works.  So plain old human engineers can internalize what the machine learned, and re-implement the solution as a run-of-the mill algorithm that does the job faster than pretending to be a brain.<p>Is this feasible?"

"Lots of the complaints in the article seem a bit contrived or not too relevant. To mention a few:<p>Performance: It&#x27;s been mentioned by others that JIT and Julia is a thing. An important point that many here seem to be unaware of is that you can compile your Julia code [0], and then end up with a fast Hello World, if that kind of thing floats your boat.<p>Language style: This is more or less a subjective thing, right? However, I&#x27;ve found that optimising for JIT forces me into writing short and pure functions. I.e., optimising my Julia code for speed also forces me to write clean code. This is a really nice byproduct of the language design.<p>Libraries: The complaints seem somewhat thin: there is no mention of the type of unit tests that the author is missing, just a complaint that the library is less featured than some in C++ or Java. Is comparing a pre-1.0 language&#x27;s unit testing libraries to those of C++ and Java a fair thing anyway? Finding that the generated instructions of a print statement are too long for your liking also does not seem to me to be a fair criticism of the language libraries.<p>Development: Complaining about the codebase being a mishmash seems unfair to me as well. I find myself browsing source code in Julia much more than other languages. With Julia I can just dive in and generally find that what&#x27;s relevant to me underneath is also Julia.<p>[0] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;JuliaLang&#x2F;PackageCompiler.jl"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;JuliaLang&#x2F;PackageCompiler.jl</a>"

"Pretty cool protocol. I&#x27;ve been following this for a couple of years. I had already written a library for an earlier version of JMAP (back then references worked differently &#x2F; didn’t exist); and it was interesting to see how that improved in the IETF process.

"I&#x27;m not a fan of Roswell or Portacle, personally, because I&#x27;m used to taking control of my setup. I try to stick with well-maintained distribution systems (e.g. Debian&#x27;s .deb or the source itself if need be) otherwise upgrades tend to be complex, not well documented, and supported by few people. Additionally, as one new to Common Lisp, it is difficult to understand the abstraction layer at which Roswell &amp; Portacle operate with respect to abstraction layers implicit to Common Lisp.<p>I better understood these layers by installing SBCL myself and playing with Quicklisp (a package manager) and ASDF (a package definition library). I wrote about this a year ago [0]. It was confusing at first. But it became clearer after exploring and writing that post. Ultimately I don&#x27;t find it very different than writing a Python library with setuptools.<p>re: SLIME; I never ended up remembering the keyboard shortcuts as a CL hobbyist so I turned it off after a few uses and stuck with vanilla Lisp-mode. Parenthesis completion and auto-ident are the only two tools I expect of my text editor (vs. in a GUI, buttons take the place of keyboard shortcuts you must remember). I use Emacs at work and home but I hardly remember any extension shortcuts (as much as I want to benefit from projectile and magit). It even took me a few years before I felt comfortable using package-install vs. just `git clone`-ing new modes and adding their paths to my .emacs.<p>For all these reasons, Portacle as a distribution isn&#x27;t really my style. Roswell didn&#x27;t solve anything for me either once I got familiar with ASDF and Quicklisp.<p>Complacency on tool UX doesn&#x27;t help a community. Roswell &amp; Portacle may be a forward iteration on UX. But I also want to share the fundamentals (or at least N-1 layer down) and get other hobbyists comfortable there too.<p>[0] <a href=""http:&#x2F;&#x2F;notes.eatonphil.com&#x2F;starting-a-minimal-common-lisp-project.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;notes.eatonphil.com&#x2F;starting-a-minimal-common-lisp-pr...</a>"

"In some Latin countries, road names are given after &quot;important&quot; people (for a vague definition of important). On the cultural side, having a standard for naming like this removes that and I think it could be a roadblock for adoption. Politicians&#x27; names are specially used for naming roads&#x2F;squares and they are always after promoting their names in every new opportunity.<p>On the other side, I really like that the code can be shortened with the addition of a location. One concern I have is that most people are very local, they exchange addresses for local places all the time... so easily speaking those addresses is nice thing. A short code helps with that.<p>And finally, I may have missed it but I didn&#x27;t see landmark references mentioned. Could it be that people would have to say &quot;I live at XZY123 in New York.

"Hiring the best engineers, technically-wise, is a good thing but it&#x27;s not enough. In my experience it&#x27;s better to hire somebody with a previous experience in the domain.

"This bug is a design smell.<p>They have a &quot;Player&quot; module that can likely be controlled by a human or by an &quot;AI&quot; module. This is good design.<p>The problem here is likely that IO is tightly integrated with Player and every other module as a dependency. This is what can cause the bug to occur.<p>Proper design is for the &quot;Player&quot; module to never depend on IO as a dependency...<p>1. the player module should be able to output the next gamestate of a game given the action and previous gamestate.<p>2. The AI should calculate the action when given a gamestate.<p>3. IO should be a function that when given gamestate, it displays it on the screen, or saves it to the DB.<p>4. All modules should be unaware of the other modules.<p>No dependencies.<p>Likely the fix that the poster is doing doesn&#x27;t involve separating the &quot;Player&quot; module from all knowledge of IO, but the fix he is doing is making AI a special case in the &quot;Player&quot; module. This speaks to all kinds of wrong.<p>Following these design patterns over a long period of time leads to code that is &quot;tech debt&quot; heavy and messy. It&#x27;s an inevitable consequence for programmers who don&#x27;t know how to design things. Also note that this is normal.

Person B figured out how to solve it but couldn&#x27;t implement it. Person C implemented it.&quot;<p>Critical to all their decisions, as I heard, were the environment, employees, suppliers&#x27; employees, and customers.<p>In most places, Person A&#x27;s recognition of a problem would lead to everyone else saying, &quot;Well, what can you do?&quot; and leave it.

"I am in Verona (Italy) at this time, and I&#x27;m in a hotel where some tourists from Shanghai happen to be as well.
I&#x27;m alone, so I hang out in the lobby a lot. I just engaged in some small talk with some of those tourists, and the discussion somehow shifted to the Hong Kong protests.<p>Basically what they sad is that western culture in Hong Kong clashes with the chinese culture. They don&#x27;t seem to say that the chinese way is the right way, or that the western culture is the one to accept. They just say that they are different, and that of course a shift in culture is difficult for Hong Kongers. They think it will all pan out somehow: Hong Kong has to accept that they are Chinese now, and accept all the consequences that come with that.<p>I understand that the viewpoint of hn, a very USA oriented site, is different, and that most people here think that the libery of HK people should not be taken away from them because democracy is the only way, but I think the chinese point of view should be heard as well, and should be taken into consideration to get a better understanding of everything that is happening.<p>My personal opinion on this is that China should just let them keep their autonomy, and let them be Hong Kong: a state by it&#x27;s own with it&#x27;s own rules and laws."
"An idea related to this helped me get a grasp on writing proofs when I was first struggling to teach myself mathematics.<p>The idea was roughly:<p>A particular formalized proof (or lemma) is one of many ways of expressing&#x2F;representing a more general concept that grounds some mathematical idea. It seems to mirror the way you could have the general concept of &quot;having gone to the store and purchased bananas&quot; in your head but express it many different ways through natural language.<p>If humans were doing mathematics by thinking purely in terms of the theorem space of some particular formal system, then &#x27;collapses&#x27; should be expected after minor errors: if you take one wrong turn, your error should be compounded in any further progress.<p>But that does not appear to be how we do mathematics. Instead we&#x27;re operating in a more general space of concepts, and we do <i>not</i> do math by proceeding linearly in our thoughts from the beginning of a proof to the final conclusion--we assemble the conception piecemeal until we get some feel for the sufficient overall integrity&#x2F;coherence of a general conception, and then secure it by building up a kind of formal carapace around it. But if part of the proof&#x2F;carapace is wrong, it&#x27;s like a malformed section of armor that needs to be replaced: the whole structure isn&#x27;t going to collapse because of it (not that that <i>couldn&#x27;t</i> happen).<p>Thinking about things that way gave me a better view (I think) on how to use and think about formalizations when doing mathematics."

"The author gets this topic utterly backward.  Large insurance companies each have essentially no business incentive to do anything except pay claims.  Maybe they try to get insureds back to baseline on the cheap, but deny an insured loss entirely?  No.  Not even investigate them.<p>And so fraudulent claims and the shadow industry that surrounds them grow in size until something bad happens, like a grandma dies in a commercially-staged motor vehicle accident.[1]  And then everyone gets all introspective and tries to figure out how we got to that regrettable point and what we can do to walk things back to a sane place where fraudulent activity is not acceptable.<p>Unfortunately, the basic incentives in the insurance industry still are, and always will remain, for companies to do as <i>little</i> as possible about fraudulent claims.  What I see in the facts reported by the article are companies that have used fraud investigators who are poorly trained or under-resourced and are generating erroneous or weakly-supported evidence of fraud, which the companies then hand off to public authorities who apparently have no better resources.  That leads to two observations:<p>1.  If the problem is irrational, counterproductive prosecutions due to poor training and resources, writing a hit-piece about supposed conflicts of interests over supplemental <i>funding</i> being used to patch the resource problems isn&#x27;t really part of the solution.<p>2.  The insurance companies are paying for the consequences of poor-quality investigations communicated to authorities by their investigators.  The article talks about some of the claimants suing the insurers for bad faith practices (and defamation?), which I&#x27;d call a &quot;cottage&quot; industry in the U.S., except that the industry is quite large and active.  The insurers named in the article most definitely have been incentivized to learn the lesson not to refer marginal fraud prosecutions-- maybe not to refer prosecutions at all-- and so we&#x27;ll repeat the cycle mentioned above until at a future time a grandmother, aunt or child is killed again in a staged fraudulent insurance claim, and then everyone will get introspective again and muse that at one point we had laws that incentivized insurers to identify and prosecute scam artists but bad press like this article led to changes that made them stop.<p>[1]  <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ifb.org&#x2F;(X(1)S(dzqyttjltzr0pry1l1wmvlxj))&#x2F;ContentPages&#x2F;CIFI&#x2F;DefaultCIFI.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ifb.org&#x2F;(X(1)S(dzqyttjltzr0pry1l1wmvlxj))&#x2F;Conten...</a>"

"I was a cubicle worker for years, making too much money doing too little work during the dot-com bubble.  I was not happy with my life, so I took my dot-com savings and left the country to go to a Latin American country to live there, learning the local language.

"Could it be that the nature of your day to day programming workload has an impact on your susceptibility to RSI?<p>My current project is full stack dev almost exclusively in Typescript, and I find myself actually hands-on-keyboard typing for much less than half of an average workday.  The rest of the time, I&#x27;m reading (documentation, library code, blogs &#x2F; presentations &#x2F; etc) or debugging.

"&gt;But last week, her caregivers found her listless and bruised, reports the AP.<p>&gt;In addition to Marium eating plastic, biologists believe she was pursued by an overly aggressive male during the mating season.<p>&gt;&quot;We assume she wandered off too far from her natural habitat and was chased and eventually attacked by another male dugong or dugongs,&quot; Jatuporn Buruspat, director-general of the Department of Marine and Coastal Resources, told the AP.<p>It seems that Marium died after being attacked by one or more males. Although the article mentions plastic in her intestines, nowhere does it say that the plastic was the cause of death. There is a good chance that a lot of the marine life invests plastic and we just notice it when we perform a necropsy after a death."

"I&#x27;m the developer of a relatively popular app (50M+ on the Play Store) and have had very disappointing experiences with the Play Store, but in a rather opposite way from the OP:<p>Once an app reaches a certain level of popularity, you begin to see &quot;knock-off&quot; apps, which are apps with a curiously similar name and icon (and screenshots and description), but which in fact don&#x27;t do anything except blast the user with full-screen ads at every turn. It&#x27;s literally just ads; they don&#x27;t perform any actual function; they just exploit the SEO boost to serve ads to unsuspecting users.<p>I have tried &quot;reporting&quot; these apps numerous times (there are dozens of them), but Google has done nothing at all to remove these apps or suspend the accounts of these bottom-feeding &quot;developers&quot;.  The only conclusion is that the ad revenue benefits Google as well as the bottom-feeders, so Google drags its feet in taking any action.  I would bet that if these apps were doing something malicious <i>without</i> a financial incentive for Google, then Google would take them down in a heartbeat."

"For all the negativity for these type of tech interviews, they are, from what i&#x27;ve seen, one of the most merit based systems out there.

The other alternate is to get jobs at good companies, they will only look at what school you went, whether you graduated with a CS degree, what companies you worked etc... All things which do not guarantee merit."

"This is also why brain mass is roughly proportional to body mass, but not very proportional to general intelligence. A blue whale has a 7kg brain, about 5x the size of the typical human brain, but doesn&#x27;t appear to have even human-level intelligence let alone 5x super-human intelligence."
"Overly broad statement.
const for global or static variables do make code faster, as they are placed in the .rodata segment, which allows swapping them out for free. This can be a huge win.<p>He only talks about const args, where the compiler does not try yet to check for casts which violate the constness guarantees. (DFA, Escape Analysis). And thus misses all important optimizations. You cannot rely on that never being implemented in the future. With LTO they already do I think."

"&gt;&gt; Is rust suitable for data science workflows?
&gt;&gt; Right now I have to say that the answer is “not yet”. I’ll  definitely reach for rust in the future when I need to write optimized low-level code with minimal dependencies. However using it as a full replacement for python or C++ will require  a more stabilized and well-developed ecosystem of packages.<p>I&#x27;m not sure rust is really aiming to be something used for data science workflows.

"I think the word architect is a failed metaphor for software.<p>What is the role of architect in the real world?  In some high profile cases they are designers - even to the point of doing something like project management&#x2F;business development (the only reason we funded this project is because of the awesome ideas we got from the architect, we worked with the architect to make sure the building would meet our dreams for this project ...).  But more commonly — I understand their role more in construction to me more in the realm of being a maintainer of documentation — maybe they have some role in proposing the original design but the majority of their time is probably spent ensuring that these plans satisfy all required regulations — and updating the plans in response to what actually happens during building so that the building itself will pass all regulations ...<p>This is nothing at all like the nebulous responsibilities generally associated with software architects.  Some projects could benefit from this level of book keeping requirement — but a lot of projects which contain “software architects” probably would reject paying someone to maintain specifications to a similar level of accuracy as is required of real world architects — especially if that was basically all that was being asked of them to do ..."

"This is interesting and would be rather useful (also sort of cool) to have a common language shared by so many people living rather near each other (except for far-away regions of Russia). Unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t look easy at all: 7 cases and 10 plus 6 extra declensions for example.
However, in reality such a common language already exists and it&#x27;s English, especially among young-enough speakers. In my experience, others often prefer to switch to English rather than pursue the fun of trying to connect the foreign words of a similar language with their meaning."

Who knows, at some point in the future, with different technologies and materials, different efficiencies and performance, we might indeed find solar energy being collected from roads. Just as we are laughing right now at the current, ludicrously oversold and patently unsuccessful efforts, future generations may be laughing at our arrogant dismissal of an idea that might ultimately have just turned out to have been ahead of its time. Let&#x27;s applaud the audacity of the solar roadways hubris in the spirit of uninhibited innovative endeavour, just as much as we pat ourselves on the back for having successfully spotted its obvious shortcomings and predicted its seemingly inevitable struggle for survival."
"I found the preprint somewhat confusing with its talk of approximate residuals and &quot;pushing&quot; pixels. Let me propose another way to think of this and someone can tell me if I&#x27;m off base. Disclaimer, I haven&#x27;t read the source code.<p>Consider a grayscale morphological operator such as erosion. For each pixel, you would replace the value with the minimum value found inside a structuring element surrounding the pixel. This is kind of like a weird morphological operator with a 3x3 box structuring element, where instead of choosing values based on a simple criterion such as &#x27;min&#x27; or &#x27;max&#x27; you use information from an approximation of the image gradient. If the gradient magnitude is above some threshold, you select the neighbor pixel in the 3x3 structuring element in the opposite direction of the gradient.<p>This generally has the effect of making the edges more pronounced. Intuitively, you&#x27;re distorting the image by &quot;pinching&quot; along the edges. To prevent weird color artifacts, they&#x27;re using edges computed on grayscale data so that the identical morphological filter is applied to each color channel.<p>It seems similar but not identical to the method described in this paper:

Sometimes technically better architecture and user interface lose to a non user friendly hard solutions due to inertia of mass adoption.<p>So a lesson in Software development is similar to betamax and VHS, so marketing is still a winner over technically superior architecture and ease of use. GitHub successfully marketed git, so git and GitHub are synonymous for most developers. Now majority of open source projects are reliant on a single proprietary solution Github by Microsoft, for managing code and project.

"Huawei will likely become the main competition for NSO group and companies like it, but that&#x27;s the least of the worlds worries.<p>Governments with resource wealth don&#x27;t need large public services that would operate a sophisticated intelligence service, so they outsource it. So far these governments have been doing point targeting against dissidents w&#x2F; mercenary surveillance companies, but it&#x27;s possible these companies  are about to be steamrolled by one that implements their products as a free feature of their entire infrastructure.<p>The bargain will be, we&#x27;ll support your campaign&#x2F;coup and modernize your infrastructure for your people, while giving you intel we collect on your dissidents and opposition. Then, once Huawei infrastructure is ensconced, no government will get into power who does not have support from China. A very &quot;harmonious,&quot; cycle. Want be be elected again? Secure our rights to extract rare earth minerals. Etc.<p>The company is a projection of Chinese state power, not unlike western telcoms with 5EYES and the ITU has been. The difference is the Party lacks the sentimentality of western countries when it comes to issues of total surveillance and intervention to maintain control. (Albeit, we have never been above supporting butchers either, so YMMV.)<p>My prediction is that once the Huawei gear is in place, a  country&#x27;s political class will turn to face east on policy and resource questions. It&#x27;s pure leverage. Western tech companies can&#x27;t make the same promises to those governments either. It&#x27;s not like Google can promise to prop up the next Idi Amin, but Huawei doesn&#x27;t have that constraint.  So far, the world has been content to deal with the devil it knows.<p>Anyway, I&#x27;d say this article is an anecdote of a larger geopolitical shift. Containing Huawei should be a national  security priority for everyone, but tbh, it&#x27;s looking more and more like our respective mere leviathans have become oversized, slow moving prey for their hydra."

My friend,still being quite confused about his dad&#x27;s instant gains: what are you talking about, where&#x27;s this coming from? Well,the guy called from the radio,they ran a game and we won.Anthony, here&#x27;s some money(it was at least a couple weeks wage),go to the shop across the road and buy topup cards,will you?

"Does anyone know how Rust&#x27;s implementation compares to C++2a&#x27;s?

I am also under the impression that existing implementation in LLVM already does some of these optimizations that Rust says they will get around to doing (as the C++ people also care a lot about zero-cost)."

"I know a lot of people here have fond memories of Encarta, but I found it to be a disappointment.

I was very disappointed because I was expecting so much more information about the topics I looked at and the multimedia elements just seemed to be there to show off the technology rather than actually be useful. I put it away and never looked at Encarta again. I know wonder if there was useful information that I never found because I didn&#x27;t spend enough time looking at it.<p>I also found many paper encyclopedias to be disappointing as well, and were only useful for giving me a short summary when I knew absolutely nothing about a topic. I really enjoyed the special Encyclopedia Britannica volumes with more in-depth articles on a smaller number of topics. Those were much better than the regular volumes with minimal information.<p>I think I wanted to learn so much more about the topics I was interested in, and information was hard for me to find in those days. Only my local public library had books the sufficient depth of knowledge to make me happy.<p>If I had known about the amazing skills of professional librarians back then, I would have had a librarian help me find information.

I would be really interested if someone did a study.  It seems Dogs in the house raise the risk significantly.  Dogs on a walk behave in the most risky way possible hanging out in tall grass and going everywhere (they&#x27;re dogs, can&#x27;t blame them) and they have a nice furry coat that is easy to grab onto for the ticks.  Then you need to check the dog and remove the ticks, bringing yourself into contact with the ticks.   Or you miss them and now the ticks are crawling around in your house.<p>Dog owners also seem to wear more casual clothes going for a walk with the dog.  The dog drags them into areas they might not have gone on their own.  The casual clothes provide more surface to grab onto vs dedicated clothes an outdoor enthusiast is wearing.  (Most feel compelled to wear appropriate clothes and at that point you can adjust for tick prevention)<p>Unfortunately I&#x27;ve known multiple dog owners who have gotten Lyme multiple times.<p>Check kids really carefully, they&#x27;re too young to know any better."

He&#x2F;she witnessed the success and applied that theory everywhere - you can always buy your way to a good impression.<p>Well, it works (kinda) on Amazon because the blame and outrage still gets created, its just that there&#x27;s no entity to ascribe the blame onto. The store is usually brandless, or can rebrand itself in an instant if things go south.<p>BUT the blame just doesn&#x27;t dissipate into thin air. No, it gets assigned to the first thing that does have a permanent brand - Chinese goods. And then, chinese culture.<p>The US tried to use covert tactics in the 70s - 90s during the cold war era, in many places including the middle east. It was a time of naivety where &quot;I can get away with doing illegal and immoral stuff&quot; was an infectious attitude. Fast forward 30 years, and the winners are the people who immediately benefitted from those actions, but the losers (the AMERICAN GOV&#x27;T AND PUBLIC) are still paying the price via terrorism in the form of extra defense costs, safety concerns, tragedies and more.<p>Again - blame and resentment doesn&#x27;t disappear into thin air. It collects, like pollution, and you pay a price a long way down the road.<p>China, you&#x27;re not an anonymous store on Amazon. You&#x27;re one of the strongest brands in the world with 5000 years of history. Your brand is larger than Amazon, Twitter, Facebook, and Google combined. This is just not worth it."
"This seems like a good step in the right direction. I think what really needs to change is the legal system. There is way too much protection of corporations via liability.<p>It&#x27;s so easy for corporations to completely screw over the public, make a lot of money, then go out of business when they public wises up to it.<p>There are tons of examples throughout America of this. Mining companies are probably the worst.<p>The legal system needs to catch up this."
"I guess he called it the &quot;software arts&quot; after &quot;liberal arts,&quot; which at Middlebury I once heard &quot;prepares you for everything but trains you for nothing.&quot;<p>It is a little interesting to think about software education that would train you for nothing, classes I&#x27;ve taken in CS and Eng do train you for some pretty specific things. I&#x27;d be interested in hearing the summary of some &quot;university courses in, for example, political theory that explore how software platforms, like Facebook, should be redesigned&quot;.<p>But this interview has tons of run on sentences that mix together concepts and everything bleeds together. For a moment I was shocked when I saw &quot;computer scientists like Donald Knuth and Steve Jobs&quot; until I realized it was two breathless sentences jammed together."
&quot;Not actual gameplay&quot; So this flashy expensive trailer is utterly pointless.<p>This is a game sequel that I am worried about. The original is a fantastic game. The sequel is being made by different people. Maybe they dont have as good an understanding of the medium of games. This trailer is a bit of a red flag in that regard already.
"One thing I&#x27;ve noticed in fundraising is that many potential investors almost expect you to have some AI-driven solution.<p>Many don&#x27;t even know what AI is, and would&#x27;t be able to sniff out bullshit no mater how much due diligence there&#x27;s involved. Dumb money is flowing in, as long as you have a great pitch and sleek presentation."
"It&#x27;s interesting how food is always the most in demand and lowest supply commodity in socialist countries (or more accurately lowest variety selection since they can barely produce enough staple foods, so they shut down the production of nice things limiting the local cultures ability to express themselves and enjoy food). You see it happening repeatedly even today in Venezuela, Cuba, and North Korea, and historically in China and Russia.<p>You&#x27;d think farming would be something they could do right since they are obsessed with those types of workers, who are their bread-and-butter. But I guess it has more to do with the price controls (probably the worst way to make something &#x27;cheaper&#x27;) and inefficiencies in the centralized organizations who think they can plan this stuff.<p>The typical excuse used by socialists re: Soviet Russia was they were exporting food for guns (because evil America), but that doesn&#x27;t equally to all of the socialists examples in history and is far more likely a direct result of their economic system."

"A third static analyzer for Python! I wonder what this landscape is going to look like in a few years... (There are probably others, but this is the first I&#x27;d heard of Pyre, and I&#x27;d only known about mypy and pytype up until today - if there are others I&#x27;d love to hear about them!)<p>On a more substantive note, static analysis is one of those things that sounds like you shouldn&#x27;t even need it but in reality is a surprisingly powerful tool, for the same reason that all code has bugs: humans honestly suck at writing code. (For those of you that have seen Bret Victor&#x27;s &quot;Inventing on Principle&quot;, I feel like static analysis is one of the first steps in getting to the kind of feedback loop he envisions.)<p>We have all these ideas around how things <i>should</i> work, but so frequently our mental model diverges slightly from what&#x27;s actually happening (which dynamic typing only makes worse, and NPEs even more so) and that&#x27;s on <i>top</i> of the mistakes we make (like this one in the JDK, which was caught using ErrorProne, a static analyzer for Java: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bugs.openjdk.java.net&#x2F;browse&#x2F;JDK-8176402"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bugs.openjdk.java.net&#x2F;browse&#x2F;JDK-8176402</a>).<p>Also, a fun tidbit about using static analysis to apply automated code fixes: this is basically when you realize you <i>need</i> auto-formatters, because you still want your code to be indented like a sane person would after applying a change like this. (And imagine how much more complex the autoformatter&#x2F;autofixer have to be when you think about how they have to do things like preserve comments, etc!)"
"If you still aren&#x27;t convinced YAML is terrible, try copying and pasting YAML fragments with a regular text editor.<p>You might end up with valid YAML, but you won&#x27;t know until the YAML consumer barfs.<p>BTW, all of a sudden XML with DTDs are looking sane again :)"
"If I were to do 3 meals a day (1500 calories is low but let&#x27;s say I snack inbetween meals) and $13 per meal on average, this will cost me $39&#x2F;day, $273&#x2F;wk, $1092&#x2F;m. Maybe that&#x27;s unfair. Maybe I use this to supplement one meal a day and cook the rest. That&#x27;s $364&#x2F;m to supplement lunch and I&#x27;d still probably have to cook some rice to go along with that. I just checked my local Indian restaurants on Postmates in San Francisco. The highest priced one was at $14.99 but ~%90 of the other options were from $8.99-$10.99 and I pay for Postmates free delivery which is 7.99&#x2F;m so pretty much negligible. The other thing is that by buying from local restaurants, I can actually make a deal with the owners if I wanted to replace all my meals for the month. Let&#x27;s say the catering discount I can get is %20, which is usually what you can get on large orders ahead of time. I&#x27;m looking at $10-$2=$8 a meal or $672&#x2F;m to supplement all of my meals.<p>Finally, I&#x27;ve seen your response to this point elsewhere which seems to be, but those restaurants won&#x27;t provide the macro nutrient breakdown or have different options for proteins. Just in the dishes provided around my house there&#x27;s chicken, lamb, tofu, cheese, beans. The only thing missing really is seitan. And if I&#x27;m ordering from the same place consistently, can&#x27;t I figure out what the macros are by asking the chef for an ingredient list? One and done.<p>I wish you all the best, and I actually love this idea but I can&#x27;t make this work in my head. To me this just seems like a new, order only, expensive Indian place opened up near me. If you could reduce prices to at least meet brick and mortar restraunts then I&#x27;d consider using your service occasionally if it tastes good."

"&gt; Firstly, China has devalued the yuan to offset the rising tariffs that the United States has been imposing. In fact, China has devalued the yuan significantly since the Trump administration first placed a 10% tariff on Chinese goods – effectively negating the tariffs. And with the new 10% tariffs that Trump has promised to imposed on a wider range of goods China has in response devalued their currency further.<p>I keep seeing claims that China is devaluing without numbers or context.<p>Here&#x27;s a 10-year chart of the USD&#x2F;CNY exchange rate:<p><a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.xe.com&#x2F;currencycharts&#x2F;?from=USD&amp;to=CNY&amp;view=10Y"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.xe.com&#x2F;currencycharts&#x2F;?from=USD&amp;to=CNY&amp;view=10Y</a><p>At the start of the current administration (Jan 2017), the rate stood at about 6.96. Today it stands at 7.04.<p>In the two years after the 2016 election (April 2018), the yuan had strengthened to 6.28.<p>According to this timeline, the first round of US tariffs hit on April 7, 2017.<p><a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reuters.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;us-usa-trade-china-timeline&#x2F;timeline-key-dates-in-the-us-china-trade-war-idUSKCN1UZ24U"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reuters.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;us-usa-trade-china-timeline&#x2F;...</a><p>From the announcement of the first round of tariffs, the yuan actually strengthened. It has only &quot;weakened&quot; in the last year, and then only back to a level that slightly exceeds that of Jan 2016.<p>Yet to hear the president and others tell it, China is on a currency devaluation bender the likes of which the world has never seen. Well, I&#x27;m not seeing it at least.<p>It seems that the 7.0 level was broadly seen as a line in the sand. But like all psychological levels, they rarely mean anything in the long term.<p>The trend is clearly for more yuan weakness based on the chart alone. Perhaps we&#x27;ll even see even massive devaluation.<p>But so far that&#x27;s just speculation. The chart tells a story of a massive bowl formation (strongest yuan point in Jan 2014) hinting at severe weakness ahead, but we&#x27;re nowhere close to that at the moment."

"This is good advice because talk is very very cheap and by actually doing something you stand out of the crowd. But doing something in a field that is new to you can be daunting and learning on your own is still very inefficient. That is why those Stanford PhDs are still worth something even if all relevant information is online - they had good mentors.<p>Here are some tricks that I find make learning process less inefficient (as applied to programming of course):<p>- Formulate specific questions. This is kind of silly but many times you will have a feeling of being vaguely stuck and will just zone out instead of making progress. Instead try to precisely and succinctly formulate the problem. You can then search the Internet, ask a question on stackoverflow (or ask a mentor :) or you can look through some good open source code and see how the problem is solved there. Formulating the question focuses you. It is important to condense the question as much as you can because this way people will have to do less work to understand it and the probability that you will get an answer goes up.<p>- Find a way to test your stuff. I don&#x27;t mean specifically unit tests, it can be &quot;testing in production&quot; with the real users (it is standard startup wisdom to get user feedback as quickly as possible) or at least solving toy problems with your code, or creating a benchmarking harness and seeing where the performance bottlenecks are. First, seeing that your stuff is actually working is incredibly motivating. Second, your taste (what the Ira Glass quote in the sibling comment talks about) is subjective and can mislead you (especially if you are a beginner) and making your code confront reality is much more objective and is going to uncover problems with your work that you weren&#x27;t aware of and maybe show that some problem that you thought very important is actually not a problem at all.<p>- Watch programming streams. This thing is getting more popular these days. Much of mentoring consists of you observing how your mentor actually does stuff - how they approach problems and what are those little tricks that help them do the work - and then copying it. Watching people programming sounds silly but it is the way to observe those tricks if you are not lucky to have easy access to someone competent."

"&gt;Youngsters these days<p>What a marvelous start, good luck looking trustworthy. It&#x27;s straight up the same as it was generations and generations before. I also love the emphasis on video games imposed in this article, from the very beginning.<p>I have a different opinion on this. While I can confirm that some team-based games can tilt someone, it&#x27;s unlikely that it contributes to mentioned suicide rates in any meaningful way. It&#x27;s just the same kind of &quot;youngsters these days&quot; activity as it was before. The actual reason may lie deeper in the current state of human society. Fearmongering by the crackpot young adults who still didn&#x27;t grow up themselves is but one manifestation of what&#x27;s happening in the bigger picture.<p>I&#x27;m ashamed to admit, being the part of this &quot;young adult&quot; generation myself, that we&#x27;re a laughable bunch of irresponsible wimps, relying on everything but ourselves to relieve the stress posed onto us by the ordinary &quot;adult&quot; problems. As the result, some of us easily fall the cult-like mobs, failing to recognize the stupidity of our derived positions and causing problems to people around us while hypocritically stating that we just want to make the world better. Our generation isn&#x27;t strong enough.

And it&#x27;s most probably our fault. Or wait, do the games cause that?

"The period of time before the infiniteness of the internet but after CD-ROMs could pack lots of information was fascinating to grow up in. You had lots of curiosity but still limited access to information so you deeply explored stuff.<p>Add to that, something like Encarta was curated by opinionated editors (whether or not you agree with them is different from the fact that the nature of content is different when it isn&#x27;t trying to find consensus amongst absolutely everyone) and did not survive based on advertising as most internet content does today.<p>That set of factors made for a very different world of reading than today."

"Disclaimer: I am not a doctor.<p>If you live in a lyme-tick area, you should have antibiotics on hand at all times.<p>If you find a tick that&#x27;s already been on you long enough to cause a red irritation spot, the clock is ticking.<p>Any time spent on finding a doctor to see, waiting for test results, seeing if symptoms develop, etc. is wasted time.<p>The sooner you make your body an unfriendly environment to the bacteria, the less time they have to grow and spread.<p>This means not only antibiotics, but also not eating anything calorie dense, eating fresh garlic and other natural antibacterials, and getting a lot of sleep, when your immune system works best. If you are a weed smoker and it makes you crave food, it may help to take a tolerance break. Coffee will not help you in this situation.<p>This is a protocol I&#x27;ve learned about from several people for whom antibiotics do not work. I think there&#x27;s a book about it.<p>Doctors have told me that a 3-day course is enough to prevent a system-wide infection if you catch it early. Once an infection settles in, a longer course is needed, typically 14 days, which will do major damage to your biome."
"I have to wonder how much work is going to be required to bring qmail up to a modern standard. There&#x27;s no doubt that the author is an extremely intelligent programmer with a deep focus on security. In the intervening period Postfix has really gained in popularity, and is shipped pre-configured out of the box on some major Linux distributions. 
It is the default MTA for Fedora&#x2F;Redhat etc for some years now.<p>I wanted to like qmail, it was definitely an improvement over the complicated disaster that is Sendmail, however, it always seemed to require patches to get it to do things that Postfix could already do out of the box. In addition I didn&#x27;t like the dependency on the inetd replacement thing (daemontools?). It just felt so un-ergonomic.<p>In addition, the Maildir mailbox format (while very cool in its own right) usually required third-party software to be patched manually, for example WU-IMAP.<p>A day or two before the September 11 attacks, the UNIX time_t value rolled over to 1 billion, and went from 9 digits long to 10 digits long. The moment this happened, a comparison function in the WU-IMAP maildir patches failed, and our IMAP server started sorting and displaying all our emails out of order.<p>After scratching our heads and poring over the source code for a couple of hours, a co-worker and I found the problem and submitted a patch to the maintainer.<p>Funnily enough, the imap-maildir page still references this event even today (it probably hasn&#x27;t been updated in years):<p><a href=""http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.davideous.com&#x2F;imap-maildir&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.davideous.com&#x2F;imap-maildir&#x2F;</a><p>Under the section &quot;10-digit unix date rollover problem&quot;.

"The risk factors directly address the questions behind whether taking down 8chan and other sites was related to an upcoming IPO:<p>&gt; Even if we comply with legal obligations to remove or disable customer content, we may maintain relationships with customers that others find hostile, offensive, or inappropriate. For example, we experienced significant negative publicity in connection with the use of our network by The Daily Stormer, a neo-Nazi, white supremacist website, around the time of the 2017 protests in Charlottesville, Virginia. We also received negative publicity in connection with the use of our network by 8chan, a forum website that served as inspiration for the recent attacks in El Paso, Texas and Christchurch, New Zealand.<p>&gt; Following the events in Charlottesville, Virginia, we terminated the account of The Daily Stormer. Similarly, following the events in El Paso, Texas, we terminated the account of 8chan. We received significant adverse feedback for these decisions from those concerned about our ability to pass judgment on our customers and the users of our platform, or to censor them by limiting their access to our products, and we are aware of potential customers who decided not to subscribe to our products because of this."

"Not sure where the author is from, but I&#x27;m not aware of any states that still allow paper PCRs. ePCRs are just a fact of life.<p>I pretty much never bother opening the laptop until I&#x27;m at the hospital. There are a lot of reasons for that, but a laggy UX isn&#x27;t really one of them (despite the fact that the UX is indeed super laggy on any ePCR I&#x27;ve ever used). Instead I use a pen and paper (or a pen and a strip of white medical tape on my thigh, for a more critical patient).<p>The reason I don&#x27;t bother is because the whole UI is just too much of a hassle. Not the application frontend, the whole thing. The laptop, the keyboard, etc. With a pen and paper I don&#x27;t have to keep taking my gloves off and putting new ones on each time I need to switch from documenting something to caring for the patient (a pen is trivial to wipe down, or just toss if needed). With a pen and paper I can jot simple notes in a shorthand I&#x27;m familiar with, rather than having to navigate to the right page to enter the information I want to record at the moment.<p>I know very few providers that bother touching the laptop prior to arrival at the hospital. Generally we write notes on paper, then bring the laptop into the ER and start typing while we we&#x27;re waiting for a bed for our patient (it&#x27;s not uncommon that this takes long enough to get the whole chart written). At my agency we have two hours from when we transfer care to when the chart has to be signed off and locked.<p>I also chuckled at the suggestion that &quot;0.1% of PCRs have errors that waste an hour of a doctor&#x27;s time&quot;. In my experience 0.1% is pretty much how frequently the PCR gets reviewed at all in the ER, and anything important enough to spend an _hour_ on would have been mentioned up front during the transfer of care (nevermind the fact that an hour is an absurd amount of time for a doctor to be spending on a single patient)."

"One thing I don&#x27;t see very often but is intensely useful is that you don&#x27;t always have to make a choice.  The &quot;Add Playlist&quot; example is a case of &quot;why not both?&quot; -- have it at the bottom of the list, have it in the header of the list, sure, throw one in the menu as well. The user journeys can be either &quot;I came here to add a playlist&quot;, &quot;Hey, here are playlists, I should make one&quot;, and &quot;Oh, they don&#x27;t have the playlist I want, I&#x27;ll make one&quot;, and all of those end up in different places. The Material-style &quot;+&quot; in the corner is in my mind almost always the worst case -- if everyone did it, then it wouldn&#x27;t be so bad, but it&#x27;s a thing you never think to look for with an unfamiliar UI.<p>I like the discussion of &quot;Poisson&quot; options; thinking about the distribution of inputs is an important factor.

"I worked at a firm who’s stated goal was for all the street to have the Terminal on one monitor and our product on the other. Our application was sophisticated and advanced, but it was a web app. The Bloomberg didn’t really do what the app did, but it felt so much better. Responsive, native, dense, and has keybindings. Using the Terminal makes you feel powerful and in control: it is extension of yourself.<p>Our app on the other hand looked and felt like all the other “modern” web apps: low information density, slow, no keybindings, and frustrating. Also it logged you out every 30 minutes! It was a total joke and we had a hard time getting people to use the product.<p>I think companies make the mistake on just focusing on features, especially with web apps. Performance is absolutely critical and the #1 prerequisite for a good product. But despite research and studies on how users care about performance a lot, developers don’t seem to. Every repeats mantras like “programmer time is more important”, “... the root of all evil”, “just wait a year or two  and your app will be 2x faster!”, etc etc.<p>With the end of exponentially increasing single threaded performance, I think developers are recently starting to realize how valuable performance is. Hopefully this trend continues and we software engineers start making software we are actually proud of.<p>The current state of development and developers is inexcusable and sad. The slow crap we make is honestly sickening."

"&gt; <i>&quot;91% of remote workers said working remotely is a good fit for them.&quot;</i><p>Right, and 97% of current ferret owners say that ferrets make great pets [0]. I&#x27;d like the survey to include people who worked remotely in the past and no longer do. Count me in that group. I worked remotely for a six months at a remote-friendly but not remote-first company and here were my findings:<p>* It was lonely being at home. And I wasn&#x27;t as productive. After a month, I rented space at a WeWork, which helped with both problems. But it requires that you be outgoing to meet people who work in your space but aren&#x27;t your coworkers.<p>* I didn&#x27;t like being physically separated from my colleagues. It meant that I wasn&#x27;t privy to many of the important conversations in the company.<p>* I was always afraid that come a round of layoffs that it&#x27;s easier to fire the folks who work 1000 miles away.<p>* In a company that isn&#x27;t remote first, it limits your career growth (most of the time).<p>* Maybe it&#x27;s just me, but I find it much easier to explain difficult technical things in person. Yes, screenshares are very helpful, but sometimes a hard problem involves going back and forth between monitors, for example. I also like being able to use a whiteboard [1].<p>* As a software engineer, it&#x27;s easy to get siloed into only communicating with people on your team and remote work only increases this tendency. If you work in an office, you meet people from other parts of the business in the cafeteria&#x2F;break room&#x2F;etc. and that allows you to have a more full understanding of the company. And it&#x27;s my belief that if you don&#x27;t understand the business, then you don&#x27;t understand what your software should be doing.<p>Overall, I didn&#x27;t hate working remotely but it wasn&#x27;t great either. I would do it again for a short period of time (e.g. a year while my wife is on sabbatical) without hesitation, but I personally didn&#x27;t like it for the long term. That said, the ability to work remotely <i>on occasion</i> is something that&#x27;s very important to me.<p>I personally wouldn&#x27;t apply to jobs at remote-only companies, but I definitely think this is the way to go if you want to make a career out of working remote as it solves a few of the problems above.<p>[0] Not saying that they don&#x27;t, for some people. Just saying that asking people who currently own ferrets means your sample is biased.<p>[1] Sometimes old fashioned is best. One of my companies moved to a new office and was thinking of installing &quot;smart boards&quot; at a cost of tens of thousands of dollars, thinking that the engineers would love them.

"One advantage of Google&#x27;s dominance and their business model being so reliant on tracking, is that it&#x27;s become the moat for its competitors: investing energy into tracking protection is a good way for them to gain a competitive advantage over Google, since it&#x27;s a feature that Google will not be able to copy.<p>So as long as Google&#x27;s competitors remain in business, we&#x27;ll probably at least have some alternatives that take privacy seriously."

"Removing adverse incentives is a step in the right direction! Now, any employee at a copyright holder assigned to send out manual copyright claims will become a <i>cost center.</i> No longer will copyright holders be able to justify such assignments via <i>captured revenue from creators</i> - instead, they will legitimately need to value the cost of the claiming against the actual damages done to the copyright holder made by the sharing of copyrighted music.<p>On the other hand, there are a lot of music videos on YouTube that copyright holders might have been fine allowing to exist, and now their only option is to nuke them from orbit.

"So many of the reactions seem to be &quot;I don&#x27;t believe it, they don&#x27;t care, they&#x27;re evil&quot;, but that doesn&#x27;t strike me as being particularly useful or realistic, because it misunderstands one very important fundamental human dynamic: the vast majority of villains think that they are the hero. Much harm is caused by those that don&#x27;t understand that they are harming others. Many that knowingly do harm think that their doing harm serves a higher, more important purpose that, in fact, demands they continue that pattern of harm. Leaders of all stripes do things that are harmful, believing that the ends justify the means and that they are in fact doing good by doing harm.<p>This statement helps empower employees to say to illustrate to their corporate leadership that they are not, in fact, doing such a great job of being good guys. I have personally gone to managers that I work for and said &quot;I think we need to invest in our employees more&quot; and been told &quot;we&#x27;re not in the business of growing our employees&quot;. I&#x27;ve had managers that state that have demonstrated wanting the things that I want but refusing to act on those wants because they believe that those wants are selfish and immature, and that acting counter to their actual desires is a form of discipline that serves a higher purpose. Many believe this is good management like making your kid eat their vegetables in spite of their protest is good parenting.<p>For example, I have been in positions where I wanted to move on from old technologies and reported to engineering managers who also wanted to move on from old technology. I&#x27;ve even seen them demonstrate this by learning the newer tools and building side projects with them. Those same managers still could not be convinced to go to bat for the newer tools because they do not believe that they have a mandate to help their employees grow. I&#x27;ve personally seen leadership and especially middle managers make decisions based solely on the statement of shareholder value and ask how, for example, modernizing tooling helps shareholders.<p>This document strikes me as incredibly helpful to workers in the position that want to advocate for their own career growth. If you agree with these principles, do not look on it with skepticism. Instead, view it as a tool in your own arsenal that you can use to advocate for positive change in your own org."

"Based on where equities are and where the bond market are, you&#x27;re going to have one hell of a hard time trying to get 5% return on the loans they&#x27;re handing out.  Take a look at some of the projections on 10 year returns for equities and bond market.  The 2018 Vanguard report shows equities will return 3% real return over the next 10 years, and there are many estimates lower than that.  Bond prices are also at all time highs.  I wouldn&#x27;t even take this loan if it were 2%."

I started working with Python around 2013 and I still consider Django the best framework to use.

Django is constantly updated and I have little to no worries about security issues.<p>Edit: And I have been following new projects such as starlette which I have really enjoyed but I have not bought into the idea of why I need async database access.

"I&#x27;m surprised this article doesn&#x27;t optimize a little further.  If you want to compute σ(n), and you can prime factor n, there&#x27;s no need to go determining all the divisors of n and then adding them up.  The σ function is multiplicative, i.e., one has σ(nm)=σ(n)σ(m) when (n,m)=1.  So if you&#x27;ve factored n = p_1^a_1 * ... * p_k^a_k, it suffices to compute σ(p_i^a_i) for each i and then multiply them together.<p>Meanwhile, while computing σ(p^a) can be done by summing, it can be done even more simply by noting that this is a geometric series and so sums to (p^(a+1)-1)&#x2F;(p-1).<p>Edit: Actually, not sure how this latter way compares to just doing Horner.  Probably about the same, I imagine.  I guess Horner would be the right way to do it if division is expensive for some reason."

"&gt;This leads to Stripe’s Negative Emissions Commitment. We will seek to purchase negative CO2 emissions at any price per tCO2, starting immediately. We expect that the best price will initially be very high: almost certainly more than $100 per tCO2, as compared to the $8 per tCO2 we pay for offsets. We don’t expect to be able to sequester all of our carbon emissions, both because the relevant technologies are not yet operating at sufficient scale, and because it would be financially infeasible for Stripe. And so we commit to spending at least twice as much on sequestration as we do on offsets, with a floor of at least $1M per year.<p>What is the difference between sequestration and offsets?"
"I don&#x27;t think &quot;assessing talent&quot; during interviewing is a skill you can learn. The skill you&#x27;re learning is assessing how well the candidate performed during the interviewing process. The interviewing process itself is what is assessing the talent.<p>Put another way, I would rather have a novice interviewer use a good process than have an experienced interviewer use a bad or mediocre process.<p>In my experience, FAANG-style whiteboard interviews are a bad process. They don&#x27;t work for assessing developers, and the skill of the interviewer can&#x27;t compensate for that. The only thing I have found that works consistently is some form of work-sample interview, where the candidate produces working code in their preferred development environment."

One comment regarding interface pollution: While I agree that in many cases it&#x27;s not needed to introduce an interface, sometimes interfaces help you hide the implementor type: I&#x27;ve now already had it multiple times that I switched from a &#x27;struct implementor&#x27; to a &#x27;func type implementor&#x27; without breaking compatabilities. Also, by exposing a struct, you also immediately expose that you can create a zero value of that type, which doesn&#x27;t happen for an interface."

"Const does make C go faster, just not in most of the places you see it used.<p>For const to help, the <i>object itself</i> needs to be <i>defined</i> const. Just taking a `const object <i></i>* ` (or `const object&amp;` in C++) doesn&#x27;t help you determine the constness of the underlying object, and that usually accounts for the majority of const usage by volume.<p>Limiting the scope to of actual const <i>definitions</i>, it can help a lot, but only in cases where the compiler couldn&#x27;t move that anyways. So local variable const definitions rarely help, because the compiler can often already prove they are const by inspection (but they can help if the variable escapes).<p>They are useful especially for global variables (and moral equivalents, like static class members in C++), since the compiler cannot prove by examining only the current TU whether the variable is unmodified (and it is a hard problem even if the whole program can be inspected), so const is a useful promise there."

"<i>It’s always better to have multiple sensor modalities available.</i><p>This is the main takeaway. Unsurprising but interesting nonetheless.

But they&#x27;re neglecting very promising approaches that allow to leverage non-annotated datasets (typically standard rgb images) to train models, for example self-supervised learning from video. A great demonstration of the usefulness of self-supervision is monocular depth estimation: taking consecutive frames (2D images) we can estimate per pixel depth and camera ego-motion by training to wrap previous frames into future ones.

"Love it.<p>I remember reading (might have been here) that math and art both get difficult at the same moment for the same reason. When you&#x27;re a kid, you live in the rational world. By this, I mean numbers that can be expressed as the ratio of two integers. Human creations are rational. The volume of a square is a neat, tidy equation. So is the area of a square. You can draw them easily, too, using a ruler and clean nifty lines, and they look great. Squares are all over human creation. You can draw a car with straight lines and squares. Wheels and other things bring in this inconvenient number, pi, that is &quot;irrational&quot;, but let&#x27;s just go with three point blah blah and it&#x27;ll be fine. At least the curvature is constant.<p>So, where are the squares in nature? Hell, where are the circles. Where is the constant curvature. How do you draw a leaf, a tree, a face? How do you calculate the surface volume of a leaf, or the volume of a tree?<p>All of a sudden, you can&#x27;t measure it with the numbers you know. There is no neat ratio of integers that will calculate the volume of that tree trunk. Or even the volume under an easily expressed mathematical equation on a graph. In fact once you start measuring nature, rather than the things people make, rational numbers aren&#x27;t <i>anywhere</i>. All of a sudden, you have to deal with limits, sequences, strange numbers that can be made arbitrarily close to zero as other numbers approach infinity. It turns out <i>every</i> number is &quot;irrational&quot;, pretty much nothing is <i>rational</i>. So, instead of irrational, let&#x27;s call it Real.<p>Where do math and art get hard? When you start to describe things as they are, rather than as we imagine the to be. You know, Real."

"Decentralized Randomness should be pretty easy to do<p>One of the problems with current PKI is weakness in the face of quantum computers, leading to a new crop of algorithms being submitted to NIST, etc.<p>I wanted to ask whether the following simple scheme, based just on cryptographic hashes, can be used CONFIDENTLY, SECURELY and RELIABLY in many situations where Assymetric Key cryptography is used today, and in many others too, such as providing provably random polling etc. It is very similar to a One Time Pad but uses a cryptographic hash function to generate the OTP codes.<p>Here is the scheme:<p>Everyone generates a random private key K[p] and store it just like any assymetric private key (encrypted with some non-stored derived key).<p>They use any cryptographic hash function that hasn’t had a serious preimage attack (perhaps even MD5?), hash it n (eg 10,000,000) times to get h[p][n], and publicly commit to that number. This is like a public key.<p>The hashes are long enough that it’s infeasible to reverse them. Key strengthening can be achieved by jumping a few onion layers between transactions.<p>If you start running out then you post a new public key, signed with one of your remaining onion layer codes.<p>Any verifiers store the original public key per participant, and then can replace them with the new public key if it was properly signed by the old one, etc.<p>Use case: generating provably random numbers by mutually distrusting parties<p>Participants they gradually reveal their hashes, one onion layer per transaction. Each provably random seed is a function of the alphabetically smallest&#x2F;largest three of those hashes at the next onion layer. If not all of them reveal the hashes in time, they gossip, verify and agree on which ones are the smallest&#x2F;largest three before some cutoff point like “most reported that most reported”. That leaves tons of bits of entropy coming from everyone!<p>Use case: Authenticator Apps<p>The hash h[p][n+1] would be a hash of some substring of h[p][n] with enough bits that finding all chosen preimages (by an eavesdropper of the previous code) would be infeasible in advance. Perhaps 10 alphanumeric characters is enough. Also when displaying the code to enter, the authenticator app can tell the user a number from 1-100 indicating to the verifier how many onion layers to peel, making it harder to precompute the preimages. Or the user would have to enter the entire hash via the network-connected computer scanning a QR code, NFC or something. From a security standpoint, this method seems superior to the HOTP and TOTP schemes used in authenticator apps today, since there is no need to trust the verifier with any secret keys (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ietf.org&#x2F;rfc&#x2F;rfc4226.txt"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ietf.org&#x2F;rfc&#x2F;rfc4226.txt</a>) Also there is no need to sychronize clocks, since the client simply lets the server know how many times to run the hash, and increments that number every time.<p>Use case: Signing Payloads<p>Participants reveal a payload and commit to an HMAC signature by using cryptographic key at the next onion level, which at that point would be known only to them. All these signatures are collected into a blockchain block &#x2F; merkle tree timestamp &#x2F; similar thing, and it is sent to the participant before they reveal the onion key they used to sign it.<p>Use case: Off the Record Messaging<p>The Blockchain or Merkle tree is private between a few parties only, so once the next onion level is revealed, no participant can prove the payload was generated by a given participant, since all the onion hashes were known, any of them could generate a new valid tree with any payload history. They can only prove it to each other, or given enough “witnesses” attest to that tree, people might trust then on the basis of consensus of (presumably) mutually distrusting parties, but that’s not the same thing as cryptographic proof. But that is true of any OTR conversation.<p>Use case: Restoring Access<p>This can be used instead of Shamir Secret Key sharing. The server would have to store keys for every participant, and M of N participants would just sign that they approve authorization of some new session, some new key, or whatever. These signatures could be easily checked by anyone who has the public keys of the M participants who signed it.<p>Use case: Decrypting payloads<p>Not sure how one would do this one, to be honest. With PKI, someone could encrypt a payload that can only be decrypted by a private key holder. I see how to do signatures and HMAC, but not the other way."

That will just take some time I guess.<p>For me personally I&#x27;ve been mixing meditation and stoisism a bit to find some peace and acceptance for my very critical self image. But it&#x27;s hard to find good stoic teaching, most of it just seems written by sleazy marketeers.<p>Last thing I would recommend for anyone interested in meditation, starting with tools like headspace a good way to get into the habit. But to be honest, I&#x27;m having a hard time still getting value out of their teachings. I went from<p>headspace &gt; just settings a timer with the Oak app for 20-30 min &gt; back to headspace.<p>I feel if made less progress then the simple timer. of course I&#x27;m not 100% sure if it the headspace app, or me just simply plateauing but my I think I&#x27;m going to go back to a simple timer. The headspace app is just so damn noisy."
"Microsoft most major chromium impact is to move input handling off the main thread which has been empirically a massive success on Edge.<p>This would allow chrome to have lower input lag than native GUIs if it&#x27;s not already the case.<p>They are also working on many cool things, openXR support for example. 
They are improving chrome devtools (and their integration within vscode) 
They are doing many performance related fixes. 
And they are massively modernizing windows apis used by Chrome. E.g better performance for sensors through new windows 10 API.
And the smart use of a Kalman filter for sensors.<p>They are also helping chromium to support windows ARM 64 bit<p>A real time view of what they are doing:

"For all those people asking why the VCs did not catch this: what sort of diligence would you do?<p>I don&#x27;t know the company or the details. Assume two scenarios:<p>1. The target company is willing to lie, fabricate code, mix in tensorflow etc.<p>2. The company will not outright lie, and will answer honestly. However, they are very optimistic about their chances, and about their ability to deliver some sort of AI-enabled solution.<p>Right now they have -- let&#x27;s hypothesize -- some sort of funnel and they route bits of code to different developers. They think they will replace some of it. They are using various AI libraries.<p>Suppose you believe that even if the AI won&#x27;t eventually code the whole app from scratch, it will make huge strides in certain areas that we don&#x27;t even know about. These strides will dramatically reduce the cost of making an app (eventually, you believe).

Why is it that most of these people are in the US? It seems to me because the environment makes people act this way. I do not think that this is because of genetics. If we mediate then we can look at the mind as an observer and change most if not all of our behavior. When someone gets a diagnosis for say ADHD.

"We need to write a lot of small APIs in Python for SPAs. We ended up going with FastAPI which utilizes Starlette under the hood. I&#x27;m surprised neither of them are mentioned here.<p>Starlette was developed by the same dev who wrote the Django RESTful package. If you mostly just need REST APIs or even GraphQL, it feels far more light and modern than anything in Django and forms some better opinions around things than the usual roll your own stack in flask alternative.

"I was the engineering manager for a time at a company who launched a competing product to dropbox (its dead now). During my time there we deployed a common c++ core that did the business logic, and we wrote the uis in Qt with Qml for the forms. We also used swig to export the c++ objects to java. Our ui forms looked native, and they ran on every mobile os at the time (Windows phone, iphone, android), and we even used some of the Qml forms on our desktop ui.<p>Yes it was kind of a pain in the ass to share code like this, but it worked, and the mobile guys mostly just dealt with the specific problems relative to the mobile domain and not api integration issues with our cloud.<p>That being said, I can tell you for certain our mobile devs (most of them anyway) would&#x27;ve preferred writing their own client api in the native language of the platform. Maybe Dropbox just got tired of dealing with that, they have the money now to hire fleets of engineers to write just about anything on any platform, why would you even bother sharing a client library in that case? But in our case, we were a small team, so we really didn&#x27;t feel comfortable just letting the next mobile dev who walked in the door come up with another foundation library.<p>Coding is hard, coding with a team is even harder."

The main issue here is that people who don&#x27;t do professional, academic research in mathematics are unaware of the complexity of modern maths. It has evolved immensely during last 50 years, the theories are just layers and layers of foundational work one has to assimilate before getting any work done. Rigorous verification takes years and no one in the academia is being offered a job for proof-reading of existing papers.<p>One should also remember that referees of the papers are not being paid, it&#x27;s considered &quot;work for the community&quot; and it&#x27;s hard to blame them for not reading the papers in detail.<p>Mathematics are anti-fragile."

We’re 98 municipalities that each operate around 300 different IT systems. These need to interact with each other, as well as major IT systems on the regional and state level (citizen base data, healthcare, taxes and so on). They’re build&#x2F;maintained by 50 major vendors and a few thousand small ones. Sometimes a system changes hands through public procurement. The longest running systems are from the 70ies, and have several layers of modern APIs build on top of each other.<p>Imagine doing all that by letting thousands of random developers run completely free. I mean, I don’t have to imagine because we didn’t actually involve architects early enough, and it’s cost us billions to correct that mistake."

"Several years ago I went on a hike&#x2F;hammock camping trip.  This was in an `old-growth` state forest and had practically no underbrush.  The ground around the campfire area was bare dirt, and I sat&#x2F;reclined on a ground-sheet and a &#x27;sit-pad&#x27;.  (two layers between me &amp; the ground).<p>2-days into the camping I started to feel like I was having a reaction to a bug bite, assumed it was mosquitoes and ignored it.<p>I got home after 4-days, went to climb in the shower and my wife pointed out that I had several ticks attached to my back.  So I grabbed my knife, pulled them off, and watched the area for a few days.  (I had my wife circle the red-welts with a sharpie to make sure it didn&#x27;t spread.)<p>I was ofcourse concerned about Lyme.  Turns out nothing happened, and the redness went down.  But I took precautions against getting made a meal of, and I still failed.  It was a sobering incident, and I know I was lucky."

Like everything in IT, it depends.<p>A high-volume app definitely needs attention to response and performance because employees will be wasting tons of hours if it&#x27;s not. That&#x27;s why primary applications should probably be desktop client-server applications, where it&#x27;s easier to control the UI. But that&#x27;s typically only roughly 1&#x2F;4 of all apps used by an org.<p>Something used only occasionally, such as for customers with special conditions, a somewhat sluggish web app is probably fine. If it&#x27;s easy to make it snappy, great, but not everything is, due to our annoying web (non) standards[1]. If it takes 100 hours of programming  to reduce 50 hours of UI waits over say a 10 year period, then the org doesn&#x27;t benefit. 10 years is a good default rule of thumb duration for software lifetime. Your org may vary. Remember to include program maintenance, not just initial coding.<p>In short, use the right tool for the job, and do some analysis math before starting.<p>[1] My &quot;favorite&quot; rant is that web-standards suck for typical work-oriented productivity applications, and need a big overhaul or supplement. Nobody wants to solve this."

"&gt; In 1859 the US Secretary of War, Jefferson Davis, strongly favored the southerly railroad route from New Orleans to San Diego: it was shorter, had no major mountains to traverse, and had lower operational costs due to lack of snowfall to clear from the tracks. However, in the 1850s no Congressman from a northern state would have voted for a southerly railroad route to aid the Confederacy&#x27;s slave-based economy, and no Congressman from the south would have voted for a northerly route.<p>I feel like this overlooks the other main reason to prefer a northern route - the north was where most of the people and industry were. The midwest and northeast were much denser than the southeast, and it was important for railroads to serve industrial hubs like St. Louis and Chicago, which had onward connections to the northeast. A San Diego-New Orleans Route is &quot;shorter&quot; only if you overlook the extra 850+ miles to get from New Orleans to Chicago, plus the additional travel within California (probably by ship). There are good reasons to prefer the northern alignment that was chosen, and Jefferson Davis&#x27; motivation was just as political as the northern Congressmen who opposed the southern alignment."

"A software architect that can&#x27;t code or refuses to has no business architecting the system. 
A software architect who doesn&#x27;t show up to stand ups really shouldn&#x27;t be dictating a solution to the team who have to build it. 
Ideally the software architect should be as hands on as possible with the team leads as the system is built up to the point that the architecture is proven or at least to see if the assumptions around the architecture actually hold up. 
Really strictly on teams leads to accurately communicate the architecture before it has been proven to hold up is risky."

"&gt; In the US, it&#x27;s cheaper to build and operate wind farms than buy fossil fuels.<p>This is currently HN&#x27;s title, and the article&#x27;s subtitle. But the article makes no statement to prove this assertion.<p>It does not even make sense to me. I guess the author meant that for firms that have high energy needs. But it is stupid to imply that the electricity provided by fossil fuel can always be replaced by wind turbines. If the need is for regular bursts, high volumes on short periods, wind won&#x27;t be of much use.<p>Moreover, the article is a digest of a report that is less emphatic. The US Department of Energy expects a slow-down of wind capacity after 2020, once the tax credit will end. For a project that would start now, there would be no tax credit, so it would be hard to reach a competitive price."

What I find fascinating with MS&#x27;s decision to use Chrome was their willingness to take the hit and learn a new code base from scratch (and not even their own moreover). Usually inertia wins at big companies but not in this case. Regardless of the final outcome I really am impressed by the engineering effort needed behind this decision.

"Really like this concept! As a vegetarian, I have come across many other services that focus on nutritionally customizable products, but when it comes to vegetarian options, the macros &#x2F; protein numbers leave a lot to be desired. I&#x27;ve also noticed that a lot of the vegetarian options available at restaurants in the bay tend to be much more carb heavy than I would prefer, and it takes a lot of overhead to research &#x2F; optimize each and every meal.<p>I&#x27;m always looking for ways to algorithmically optimize my meals, and currently Chipotle and their app does the best job of enabling this in a standardized way (can pretty easily get nutrition info and hook it into other apps) , but it ends up being pretty boring on a routine basis. Something like this, with an expanded product line would be really useful."
I&#x27;m surprised this blog post made the first page of HN given its lack of sources or analysis.<p>Maybe a good discussion can come on one example startup advice from YC: do things that don&#x27;t scale.<p>I think this is really sound in that they&#x27;re saying &quot;get product-market-fit with some segment of users.&quot; i.e. know that there&#x27;s demand for your product&#x2F;service even if it&#x27;s pretty manual to deliver early on. Then see how to automate. Because most product&#x2F;services aren&#x27;t materially better than existing options and so you never get product-market-fit even when it&#x27;s entirely manual and customized to the user.<p>As a founder I&#x27;ve been guilty of building first because it&#x27;s fun. I saw what I wanted in user research and built a whole app accordingly. It failed. Would&#x27;ve been better to start with a smaller attack surface (email newsletter) and once we found success to then scale. The interesting thing is I knew of the advice &quot;do things that don&#x27;t scale&quot; beforehand. But until I failed I didn&#x27;t know why it mattered and how to apply it.<p>Net: applying advice is harder than evaluating if the advice is good or bad. You want to have enough time to fail a lot and then appreciate the wisdom of startup advice :-)
"Does this test for edibles? If a user has THC in their blood stream but not from their lungs, will this show up? Alcohol is absorbed through the stomach, passed through the bloodstream and released through the lungs.

"I&#x27;m can&#x27;t dispute that fast software is a desirable trait for users.  I would love to spec low latencies into the requirements documents for my GUI projects.  But from a business standpoint, UI latency requirements are a good way to sabotage a project.<p>Slow solutions have a dramatic business advantage: using libraries, you can shave months off your delivery schedule by adding miliseconds to your UI delays.   The months add up; so do the miliseconds.  By using someone else&#x27;s crufty libraries, you can write a calculator app over the weekend.  Libraries will handle the double buffering for screen painting, unpacking fonts and rendering them into bitmaps, how to reflow text onto a screen, etc.  It might take seconds for the app to load all it&#x27;s assets and display the first user activity, but it was cheap to create, easy to iterate, and it gets the job done.  These are hallmarks of a valuable startup engineering effort.<p>But the development process for speedy applications is anathema to businesses of any size.  You have to throw away Electron and hire systems engineers with knowledge of the entire platform.  After some profiling, they may determine that the required speed is only possible once the system event handler has been replaced with a pared down routine, or when the framework&#x27;s audio interface is bypassed so the sound card can be accessed through low-latency DMA mode.  You have to repeat this for every platform you intend to support.  You have to throw away the wheel that everyone else is using and pay to reinvent one that spins a little faster.<p>To paraphrase Joel Spolsky&#x27;s comment on rewriting software: are you sure you want to give that kind of a gift to your competitor?  For most companies it isn&#x27;t worth it.<p>Are there exceptions?  Yes: a motivated engineer like John Carmack may work months to eliminate another 3ms frame latency out of a VR headset simply because of personal passion.  Google can amortize additional billions by wringing 100ms out of page load times by funding a browser project so complex that you also have to design a new build system for it.  But if you&#x27;re not Carmack and you&#x27;re not Google, you probably can&#x27;t afford to reinvent the wheel."

"The point where this becomes annoying is, when you&#x27;re building a third party app or experience that is designed to be embedded in an iframe. Not a hidden iframe to track users, or for advertizing, but as a first-class experience, which can be embedded and displayed on a page on a different domain, and interacted with by users.<p>I wish the latest round of privacy restrictions (which I think are overall a decent idea) would take these use cases into account, or at least allow a mechanism to request the user&#x27;s permission to use third party cookies for sites they trust.<p>Native apps have pretty robust permissioning systems.

"That&#x27;s a step in the right direction for all major components to be designed together but it&#x27;s not adequate because normally you have to make structural changes to components over the course of the development and maintenance of the project.<p>So all components need to be designed and maintained with a high degree of visibility and ideally direct cooperation.<p>My impression is that the core structures of these contracts are always flawed.  For example, they seem based on detailed pre-estimation and fixed fees.  To me it would be more realistic to give ranges and focus on core goals and milestones with the expectation that detailed requirements will evolve.<p>But stepping back even further, the paradigm that drives all of this which is labelled as &quot;defense&quot; is quite an outdated paradigm.  So expecting operational aspects to make sense might be asking too much.  The paradigm goes back to for example <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Roman%E2%80%93Persian_Wars"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Roman%E2%80%93Persian_Wars</a>"
"A sorta-weird thing about Slavic languages is, they evolved different meanings from the same roots—though related. So you constantly have your recognition of words misfiring.<p>E.g. Old East Slavic ‘недѣлꙗ’ (‘nedělja’), meaning ‘Sunday’, somehow come to mean ‘a week’ with Russian ‘неделя’, while even close Belarusian and Ukrainian have ‘нядзеля’ and ‘неділя’ for Sunday, same with Bulgarian ‘неделя’ or Czech ‘neděle’."
&gt;Right now even with a very tech-forward customer base 500 customers will only rarely spike above 900 Mbps (0.9Gbps). That means that even at peak times a customer could still come on and run a speed test and get 100Mbps.<p>Is this still true?

I would literally kill for a tablet that did nothing but very very very very good active pen stuff. I bought a Dell latitude tablet and while it&#x27;s good enough (one note is also just good enough) that I don&#x27;t regret it I&#x27;ve been wondering whether I could put together something that just focused on digitization using something a pi. are there any plans to support an active pen?

"I work in agtech and I&#x27;m not surprised by this at all.<p>The major corn and soy producers have faced downward pressure for the last 4 years. It now costs more to plant the crop than to pick and sell it.<p>And yet, the government pushes and incentivizes farmers to just grow more.<p>Read <i>This Blessed Earth</i> or <i>Omnivore&#x27;s Dilemma</i> if you want a primer on how messed up this system has become.<p>What farmers need are a way to restore profits in a sustainable fashion.

Not really.
"This has been a long time coming. Short term profits as the only goal has been destroying the market rather than serving it. It&#x27;s time to make lasting investments in pooling capital, human ingenuity, and goodwill to build corporations that can stand the test of time.<p>It remains to be seen how seriously this will be taken and how closely companies will follow it. However, giving any benefit of the doubt makes this likely the best news we&#x27;ll hear about anything for some time."

"I had always dreamed about a city without advertising, and couldn&#x27;t wait to visit São Paulo. And when I did, I was completely shocked to discover... I hated it.<p>Until you experience a lack of advertising, it&#x27;s hard to imagine quite how gray and boring and non-vibrant a city looks without it. Turns out billboards and panels full of dramatic movies and TV shows, beautiful smiling faces selling makeup and phones... actually add a lot of character to a city and make it feel like things are happening and going on.<p>Imagine if books no longer had graphic covers anymore, just all solid gray and beige and black covers, and you walked into a bookstore. It feels kind of like that.<p>If you&#x27;re going to get rid of advertising, at a minimum you&#x27;ve got to replace it with something -- like a <i>lot</i> of murals, like murals <i>everywhere</i>. (The Bushwick neighborhood of NYC has some areas full of street art, which works pretty well.)"

"Some elderly people who live alone like the TV on for company - in many cases they aren&#x27;t even watching it properly, they just have it on in the background to feel less lonely, like there are other people in the house with them. The article even alludes to this albeit in negative terms &quot;this includes time spent engaged in other activities while the television is blaring in the background&quot;. But it is a very different pattern from being &quot;screen-obsessed&quot; and &quot;waste hours ... fritter on chat-shows and repeats of soaps&quot;. I think the author could benefit from showing a little more sympathy towards people who have circumstances different from their own."

"speculation on the origins of this ... in the San Francisco Bay Area, over the last twenty years, many ordinary downtown office+retail buildings became empty, due to some combination of suburban sprawl, loss of mom+pop retail, excessive rent-seeking and urban decay. Meanwhile, tons of twenty-somethings were arriving with a backpack and a laptop .. it was too fast and fluid for anyone to want an &quot;address&quot; .. so, the idea of flexible techie office &quot;pop-up&quot; shared spaces was obvious. Some tried it alone, and some tried to brand it with extras .. and FAILED FINANCIALLY.. practical people, who did try. If you have not failed this way, then you do not know how painful it can be, at the small business level.<p>At any rate, from one point of view, this WeWork thing is just the oversize &quot;winner&quot; from New York City, in this dog race.

Is there a subsidy for lowering emissions that would make getting this worthwhile?<p>Also I can&#x27;t help but wonder how the seaweed affects the microbiome of the cows in the long term. It does kill the microbes that make methane. IIRC, microbes are pretty much essential for cow digestion. Are the microbes that this seaweed kills essential for digestion or some other purpose?"

"From reading the comments, I really wonder how many HN Users are tax evaders. I see the top two comments are “the tax code is too complicated, we shouldn’t be going after tax evaders” and “this isn’t actually a big problem.” If the government is getting more money collecting unreported taxes than it costs to fund the collecting of said taxes, what’s the problem?"

We are finally approaching the same order of magnitude of complexity in structure.<p>Also note that this is not manufactured on TSMC&#x27;s highest density process. Assuming TSMC&#x27;s 3nm process development is successful, that will probably be 6x denser than the 16nm process used here."

"An open, high end CPU design is really going to change the cloud market.

Then you short the stock once you get the desired movement and finally you remove the money from this stock so it goes into free fall and all people start selling. Finally, you close the short position when you notice there is no room for stock going further down.

"Blender, despite its &quot;odd&quot; UI, is the best open source GUI software out there. I don&#x27;t use any other GUI open source software -- I pay for Microsoft Office and Adobe Applications -- but I find Blender to be useful, productive, and complete. It&#x27;s solid, and has a very good community. Unlike other open source &quot;alternatives&quot; to commercial software (like, say Gimp or Open Office), it&#x27;s actually _better_ in many ways, and not just FUD or useful to casual users."
Probably the most compelling feature of Blender being open source with a significant community is that it&#x27;s the one 3d tool that Autodesk can&#x27;t simply buy out.

"There&#x27;s a problem that maybe is related to this law, but the article haven&#x27;t said anything about it. The increase of flyer distribution around the city. In the last years basically everywhere you go someone will stop you to give some flyers, paper that usually people will just throw in the streets and increase the pollution."
American agriculture in general and corn growing in particular has been propped up and distorted by pointless subsidies for decades.  Now the time has come to pay the piper for artificially manipulating the market.
It’s not a lie if you think ‘artificial intelligence’ means ‘pretending to be clever’

"Circa 2011 I was doing support for MaxCDN and from time to time there were recurring issues with Cloudflare and our service being used together with a WordPress plugin. They ended up reaching out and we all got on a call not knowing what to expect. Long story short, call went great and we worked together on a solution that helped our shared customers. Cloudflare has made the CDN industry better. They&#x27;ve made huge contributions to the open source and webperf communities and I&#x27;m really happy for them."
"He should have also sued Pax Labs, the company that spun Juul out (likely for this very reason) when it was still getting off the ground as R&amp;D.<p>This structure was definitely chosen to protect Pax Labs."
"This seems to be a review of Julia as a general-purpose programming language. For example the reviewer points out early that the review is not targeted at people who like Matlab&#x27;s syntax.<p>So this reads a little bit like yet another review of a math DSL, written by and for people who don&#x27;t need or like math DSLs.<p>Not surprisingly, it comes out negative."
Hottest probably where they measured. This year (2019) was one with the most rain and coldest spring and summer in many years where I live.<p>We started joking that &quot;winter wants to spend summer holiday with us&quot;. Romania
People are very creative at spinning consulting shops as AI software something or other to get a higher PE. The most prominent example being Palantir.
"As a non-expert in the specific industry, but a tech person who reads S-1s with interest, I like the look of Cloudflare. It is providing a global infrastructure product and clearly building something that other companies will use and integrate in way that makes it sticky to leave.<p>I can&#x27;t remember who said it, but I definitely subscribe to the idea that cloud providers are essentially a tax on businesses that use the internet to drive their business.That makes CF attractive.<p>My feeling is that the risk that will affect it in the long run are macro: global downturns, over reliance on a specific sector, regulation, freezing out of markets due to unfair competition from local players and spikes in energy costs (curious why this wasn&#x27;t mentioned in the S-1 specifically)<p>They also have no outlined plan for the capital they will raise, this may be a good sign, no bold bets, just keep the marketing spend going and achieve greater scale.<p>It&#x27;s getting harder and harder to judge if something is a good bet these days. Nobody is actually making a profit, the dual stock structure is troublesome, and the access to capital feels too easy. Ir frustrates me that it&#x27;s impossible (for a mere mortal with €500 a year to invest) to get in at an early stage when you can watch the value rise and feel a connection with the company."

"Though I have no complaints about the way they went about implementing it (open standards hooray!), as a mail client author and someone with lots of experience with mail in general - I&#x27;m NACK to JMAP. I think that it comes with some questionable design decisions (HTTP? JSON?) which on their face I imagine look fine to the typical HNer, but in many ways is a regression from IMAP. I would prefer to see the limitations of IMAP addressed with a few carefully written extensions to the spec - which is already extensible and has a thriving set of useful extensions in the wild.<p>By no means is IMAP a particularly good protocol, but it is extremely broadly supported and designed more with email in mind than JMAP appears to be, which seems to focus more on bringing shiny web tech to email regardless of its utility in such a context. It&#x27;s also one of many closely interlinked mail-related specifications, and JMAP fails to integrate well with many related specs imo."

"Now, how do I convince my management this is a problem?"
"Reviews aren&#x27;t bad, but they don&#x27;t necessarily stop bad apps, and they slow down good ones.<p>The worse part of approval delays is that they are almost never given time in development schedules made by project managers, bizdevs, marketing etc.  They just absorb that few days into the dev time or take from testing etc.<p>In a way, having long app reviews, or delays to update, causes worse quality apps from having dev days or testing days taken from the app development cycle and rushed fixes just to get it back in the pipeline. This is a very common occurrence in app&#x2F;game development. I wish it weren&#x27;t this way but quality has to be fought for and it can harm the people pushing for it perceptually as &#x27;slow&#x27;.<p>Basic heuristics on release for bad actors is enough, then upon launch have random reviews that check out what people are doing past the point.  The problem apps are usually getting through the review by cheating and then turning on features that are dark patterns or malware type junk.<p>Any reviews over a day or two add to bad quality simply due to compressed timelines."
"This is not going to work. Just walking through a cloud someone exhales at you would make you test positive. Being at a party would make you test positive.<p>Honest question, why can&#x27;t companies seem to come up with ideas that don&#x27;t involve violating the rights of people?"
"I once had a very stubborn intern who decided to add as much const as he could in our codebase.
What followed was a heated discussion and I did a global replace of const by nothing.<p>The main problem with const is that it&#x27;s ugly, it&#x27;s viral and it does not add any value to the code.<p>And I know all the supposedly good things about this, but I never found any real usage in practice."

"&gt; It&#x27;s Time to Get Serious about Tick-Borne Diseases<p>I was diagnosed with Lyme disease two years after a tick bite in Nth Germany. A strong course of antibiotics cured me of the disease. At the time I got to learn of the chronic Lyme community (typically self diagnosed) and what the specialist doctors are saying.<p>It seemed to me that the range of possible symptoms of this disease, and the difficulty in diagnosing it, make it a nice excuse for other problems somebody might be experiencing.<p>Ultimately, the best evidence I saw - the people in the hospital diagnosed with Lyme disease tended to have identifiable symptoms, e.g arthritic joints, while the self diagnosed complained of feeling unsociable and not motivated to continue with working."
"Another one: Parsing partial YAML files doesn’t detect an error with loading the complete file. We’ve had a production outage, because of large yaml files getting cutoff and not all settings getting loaded into our server. JSON or XML typically will not parse."
"&gt; So in the next email (sent a minute after I received his reply) I sent him a zipped file of code with an explanation that &quot;this is what I&#x27;ve done so far which is about 70% of what you want&quot; and he immediately replied saying &quot;Whoa you are serious. That is refreshing .. &#x27;<p>&gt; So a few days later, I sent along a detailed algorithm that expanded his idea, with a formal proof of correctness and a code implementation and he suddenly switched to a more expansive mode, sending friendly emails with long and detailed corrections and ideas for me to explore.<p>And then the whole internet stood up and clapped."
Why not just use angular cli and be done with it?
"The stock market is a complex adaptive system where the agents are constantly changing their strategies so that even if you were to find inefficiencies or patterns, they are only ephemeral."
"One of the principles the article highlights is that additional features make a software complex and therefore more likely to fail. This is true, but I&#x27;d argue it&#x27;s not for the reason the article claims.<p>The claim is:<p>&gt; Stakeholders who want to increase the priority for a feature have to also consider what features they are willing to deprioritise. Teams can start on the most critical objectives, working their way down the list as time and resources allow.<p>In other words, the argument is &quot;competing priorities in a large-scale project make it more likely to fail, <i>because stakeholders can&#x27;t figure out which ones to do first</i>.&quot; Actually, in this very paragraph, the author glosses over the real issue: <i>&quot;Teams can start on the most critical objectives, working their way down the list&quot;</i> - treating development as an assembly line input-to-output process.<p>I argue that it&#x27;s not time constraints that complex programs bad, but instead the mere act of thinking that throwing more developers at the work will make it any better. Treating the application as a &quot;todo list&quot; rather than a clockwork of engineering makes a huge difference in the quality of the work. When developers are given a list of customer-facing features to achieve, more often than not the code winds up a giant ball of if-statements and special cases.<p>So yes, I do agree that complex software is worse and more prone to failure than simple software - but not for the reason that there&#x27;s &quot;too much to do&quot; or that prioritizing is hard. Complex software sucks because it&#x27;s requirement-driven, instead of crafted by loving hands. No one takes the time to understand the rest of the team&#x27;s architecture or frameworks when just throwing in another special case takes a tenth of the time."

"Having millions of people regularly commuting into major cities is a disaster.<p>You create all this traffic, congestion on trains, sometimes people packed liked sardines for what? To sit in an office and work less than you would in the peace and quiet at home.<p>Much better if governments encouraged people to work from home, maybe have local hubs where people can go to if they can&#x27;t work at home.<p>Cut down on the traffic and let people enjoy more of their lives.<p>When I don&#x27;t WFH, I commute 4 hours a day, in and out of london - i&#x27;d rather spend that with my kids."
Just last week I was wishing exactly this existed. There are so many businesses where the main hurdle to get over is the basic institutional knowledge.<p>I wonder how cheaply it could be done for 1 customer (my parents house has terrible wireless internet and I&#x27;d like to move home and try doing a startup)

"I think having lots of data points is the only way to give proper advice about Startups. YC has given outstanding startup advice from a specific SV perspective.<p>I&#x27;ve been running a UI&#x2F;UX design firm for the last 10 years, working with small unknown bootstrapping founders, up to well funded and awesome companies founded by super stars like Elon Musk and others. Though this was never my intent, over the years we&#x27;ve collected so many datapoints that alongside our design work we tend to advice and steer the companies we work with into directions we think the company should go. All backed by real examples from previous experiences. Being in positions where you work with a lot of companies over a longer period of time, I think, is the best way form thoughtful startup advice."
"A lot of people out there just go through the motions. They aren&#x27;t particularly interested in their field, and seek &quot;mentors&quot; just because this is something you&#x27;re supposed to do. This is a waste of time for both the mentor and the mentee. In 20+ years in the industry I only had one mentee (out of half a dozen), who was not a waste of time. She&#x27;s a senior manager at Facebook now. Super smart, and very strongly intrinsically motivated. She&#x27;d succeed without any mentorship just fine, but hopefully I helped her get there faster."
"So it&#x27;s an &quot;I&quot; startup? Almost like you get more than you paid for, haha."

"I for one look forward to our federal overlords thinking they have any clue what kinds of transmissions deserve security &#x2F;s.<p>Seriously though, the legal tradition just hasn&#x27;t caught up to the idea that somebody can possess information outside their person that can&#x27;t be forced into the eye of the law.<p>I&#x27;ve thought about this a lot and my best conclusion so far is &quot;give up the encryption keys in exchange for immunity against legal cases that aren&#x27;t yet open that the secured data might reveal, or you&#x27;re guilty by default&quot;. Seems like the kind of thing prosecutors might think twice about, and it gives them a trump card in extraordinary circumstances.

"I don&#x27;t see anything changing as long as short-term decision-making is incentivized. Executive shares should vest according to some multiple of the average tenure of a company in the S&amp;P 500. If the multiple is 1, that means you need to beat the average to own a share of a company you manage. Tying it to the market average calibrates this schedule to the pace of company turnover due to external factors, such as population growth, technological change, etc. I&#x27;m not proposing a legal framework beyond requiring that these norms be promulgated and individual companies required to report the terms of share grants to management. Let investors make decisions armed with this information and enforce the norms that way. Maybe some form of this is already normal; I&#x27;d be curious to know."

Is that correct? I read that as “x is a pointer to a const int”<p>If you want “x is a read-only pointer to an int”, you would need<p><pre><code>  void constFunc(int * const x)

"I noticed that the people who interview a lot don’t really get anything in return; in our quarterly engineering org meetings or whatever there’s a slide thanking the people who interviewed most. I’ve never gotten a thanks when I interviewed more than other times, nor any other indication that this is something my manager values. (And what your manager values is kind of everything, in my experience.)<p>So I almost never volunteer when they need someone to cover, don’t try to put more effort into it than necessary, and have blocks in my calendar so they don’t try to schedule when I don’t want them. It may be crucial for the company (and ethically, you owe it to candidates to treat them fairly) but it’s not treated like something they value.<p>For what it’s worth, I somehow slipped through the cracks and didn’t have to interview for quite a long time after I started.

"This is nice but I like this advice much better:<p>Ira Glass quote:
&gt; Nobody tells this to people who are beginners, I wish someone told me. All of us who do creative work, we get into it because we have good taste. But there is this gap. For the first couple years you make stuff, it’s just not that good. It’s trying to be good, it has potential, but it’s not. But your taste, the thing that got you into the game, is still killer. And your taste is why your work disappoints you. A lot of people never get past this phase, they quit. Most people I know who do interesting, creative work went through years of this. We know our work doesn’t have this special thing that we want it to have. We all go through this. And if you are just starting out or you are still in this phase, you gotta know its normal and the most important thing you can do is do a lot of work. Put yourself on a deadline so that every week you will finish one story. It is only by going through a volume of work that you will close that gap, and your work will be as good as your ambitions. And I took longer to figure out how to do this than anyone I’ve ever met. It’s gonna take awhile. It’s normal to take awhile. You’ve just gotta fight your way through.

"Seems to be getting the HN hug of death. Here is an archive:
<a href=""http:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.is&#x2F;IT34b"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.is&#x2F;IT34b</a>"
"The key difference between `const` and the `register` and `inline` keywords is that, despite all of them often flagging optimisations that the compiler can often work out anyway, `const` still aids human comprehension by declaring constraints, whereas the latter two do not.<p>It seems that interprocedure optimisations in modern compilers make a lot of const-by-reference optimisations apply even when the code is mutable-by-reference in the parameter list but the function body doesn&#x27;t modify it in practice. This would only work if it could deterministically work out which function is called.<p>Local constant stack values surely can be completely deterministically verified as such by the optimiser even without the `const` modifier. They could be overwritten without a C assignment to it, via the stack from a buffer overflow of an array next to it, but that&#x27;s undefined behaviour so a compiler is presumably free to assume it is not modified, eliminate unnecessary register&#x2F;memory loading code, and let the developers deal with the consequences.<p>As trailing `const` on member functions outlaws modifications via `this`, it would follow that the same optimisation-even-without-modifier process would apply as to `const` local stack values.<p>As constancy is a constraint that aids human comprehension, there&#x27;s a good reason for choosing a keyword just as short as the mutable equivalent, such as Swift&#x27;s `let` vs `var`; if the more constrained equivalent is equally or more convenient, more constrained and thus easy-to-reason-about code becomes more common."

"For those who are curious, the building age data comes from the Dutch government (as others already said).

Took a few months, but once enough volunteers hopped on, it went quite fast. If I remember correctly, once you got the hang of it (your third import or so), an average municipality took about 2 hours (we have 350 municipalities).<p>For the Dutch speakers among us, more info about the project can be found here: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.openstreetmap.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;NL:BAG"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.openstreetmap.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;NL:BAG</a><p>I am not sure where Mapbox&#x27; height data comes from. In OSM, you can give a &quot;levels&quot; tag to indicate how many levels a building has (from which the height can be estimated), or a height tag in meters if it is known, but the buildings don&#x27;t have that. Perhaps it is just assumed that large buildings are a bit taller and building=house is an average house height unless otherwise noted? Or maybe they use the Dutch AHN, which is a very accurate height scan of the Netherlands. Some people made it into a 3d picture, e.g. <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;snipboard.io&#x2F;Sq6C38.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;snipboard.io&#x2F;Sq6C38.jpg</a> (this only uses AHN data, not OSM, so it only has the tops of objects as points, but that&#x27;s still quite an accurate outline)."

"As an ansible user, I hate YAML and its broken parsers with a passion, but the security objection does not make much sense. It does apply verbatim to any parser of anything if the implementation decides that a given label means &quot;eval this content right away&quot;.

"I am in the process of making a major life change to focus on remote first work. I&#x27;ve recently moved and I am currently looking to purchase a house in a small town from where I plan to work full-time.<p>I think the caveats people bring up are serious and require careful consideration. They are part of why I am trying to find a company that is &quot;remote-first&quot; and I would prefer to avoid companies where I am one of a handful of remote employees while the rest of the team is co-located in one or more offices.<p>My major fears are:<p>* I suffer from isolation and loneliness and it impacts my mental well-being<p>* I find my career progression stalled<p>* I miss out on more lucrative compensation<p>* I find my coworkers making decisions without consulting me<p>* I experience an increase in general anxiety<p>* I find my productivity and focus to be significantly less<p>* I am unable to balance work&#x2F;life when they are combined in the same place<p>The worst case scenario is that a combination of my fears being realized forces me to recognize my unsuitability for remote work. I would then be stuck in a smaller city with less opportunity, potentially with a mortgage. I might be forced to sell my home for a loss, to move back into a bigger city and to attempt to find a normal job to rebuild my retirement savings.<p>My plan to mitigate these is to be aware of my fears and to put into place strategies that can deal with each one. I believe that companies that plan to be remote-reliant in the future will need expertise at the management level to deal with those issues throughout their workforce. Where there is legitimate fear there is also opportunity. I believe that all of the problems associated with remote work can be handled if they are openly discussed."

"<i>Did that quarter-second lag kill anyone? Was there someone who wouldn’t have died if the ePCR was just a little bit faster, fast enough to be usable? And the people who built it: did they ask the same questions? Did they say “premature optimization is bad” and not think about performance until it was too late? Did they decide another feature for the client was more important than making the existing features faster? Did they even think about performance at all?</i><p>This seems like a lot of imagining of scenarios that may or may not have happened. Perhaps another way of looking at this is - did the company hired to build this actually care whether EMTs used their software, or were they looking to get a paycheck?<p>So many health tech firms fall in the latter bucket.

The only thing roads have going for them as a location for solar is that we (humans) have a lot of road area to work with. Wouldn’t it be great if roads did double duty supporting our tires AND making some energy?<p>I’ve always wondered if there were some way to use the space above (as in you drive under them) the roads instead. Is there a mass-efficient-enough design to make putting panels above the road a profitable thing.
"I think both Apple and Google should make reviews optional.<p>Sure, give preference to the reviewed apps in the store, put a nice badge on it when it&#x27;s reviewed, add a setting to allow unreviewed apps to install, prevent kids from installing unreviewed apps, etc, but at least let me upload my app when and how I want to."

For example, I would order the saag tofu, but I&#x27;m curious where the fat is coming from (assuming coconut milk base, my version is still leaner). Thanks Soham!"

"&quot;Thank you very much, but I will buy the Computable numbers, instead. They do not require abandoning my sanity (although I am aware I must still abandon rationality).&quot;<p>In particular, the reals mean you accept measure theory, which in one of its key results says you can build two spheres of radius x from one sphere of radius x, and no holes. The computables don&#x27;t go there.<p>There are infinitely many computable numbers, but only <i>countably</i> many -- no more than of natural or rational numbers. That turns out to be enough for everything sane you want to do.<p>Of course you need altered versions of the key theorems of calculus, because the computables are not continuous in the &quot;real&quot; sense. The numbers blur a bit, instead, to cover the gaps, much as water manages to behave like a fluid despite being made of nothing but discrete particles. The differences are a PITA but keep you on the straight and narrow. You get the same answers for everything that makes sense, and no answer for things that don&#x27;t.<p>All the supposedly real numbers you will ever encounter are computable (too). Roots, pi, e, anything representable with a Taylor series. So you don&#x27;t really give anything up.<p>Reals make a good enough approximation, which means you don&#x27;t need to go hungry. Pretend you&#x27;re using reals. Nobody needs to know. Everybody else is, too. The sane, anyway."

"&gt;  The protesters learned in 2014 that having leaders was a weakness. Once the leadership was arrested, the heart went out of the occupy movement, and it lost momentum.

"I have dreams of Wikidata eventually being leveraged to enable similar interactivity. Currently Wikidata can store plenty of information, but there&#x27;s no reason it shouldn&#x27;t keep growing. Right now items already often have dates and coordinates - creating interactive maps and timelines is theoretically just a matter of implementation. Ideally, though, I want Wikidata to be so much more: why shouldn&#x27;t it contain historical weather data? TV listings? Sports results? Having all of this available in an open and structured format would make all sorts of things possible, and I think we&#x27;re only scratching the surface.<p>The other big &quot;problem&quot; with Wikipedia is copyright (and it&#x27;s certainly not Wikipedia&#x27;s fault), but there&#x27;s a surprising amount of public domain work (thanks to many governments, especially the US) and of course tons of user-submitted work that ranges from bad to incredible.

"&gt; “We like features that improve both power and performance,” Clark elaborated. “Being on the right path more often is important because the worst use of power is executing instructions that you are just going to throw away.

This definitely burns more power on the front end, but it pays dividends on the back end.”<p>Every documentation I&#x27;ve seen is quite light on the branch prediction improvements. Going by the slides, they improved is accuracy by 1&#x2F;3; I&#x27;d be curious to know how.

I don&#x27;t meditate regularly but every time that I do it again (and if properly), the thought that opens is something like &quot;where have you been so long &#x2F; why have you denied this to yourself for so long&quot; type of question.<p>And yet, I feel like doing that every day is not fully compatible with the type of consciousness which is optimal to get me from day to day in my life as a software engineer.<p>Meditation sharpens your senses -- you may then find yourself distracted by sounds of road traffic that you previously didn&#x27;t care about, you may discover that the air in your area smells bad to you from time to time, you may realize how locked most people are in their own patterns (that includes you). You may find yourself thinking about going to a Buddhist monastery somewhere and trying this for a longer time. I&#x27;m just saying it&#x27;s really _that_ good.<p>Whereas, if I do what I love, and I let my consciousness to its own momentum, I feel like it&#x27;s auto-tackling the daily roughness of life more on its own and not bothering me with otherwise unimportant things that much. In essence, you were born into this physical reality to be a thought &#x2F; to have thoughts, not to be thoughtless &#x2F; formless.<p>That said, mindfulness meditation as a consciousness-momentum modification tool, applied (even daily) within the proper bounds, can a venerable weapon for life.<p>I guess I just find it to be an extra overhead to manage if everything else in my life goes really well even without it.<p>p.s. If you use meditation as a daily crutch(?)&#x2F;bandage(?) to something that _really_ bothers you, there are much more effective weapons to try (one-off, by no means regular use): Ayahuasca, Shrooms, Family Constellations -- after healing with these, the meditation itself can provide you with much more, as a cherry on the top."

It’s not like WeWork invested co-working spaces, so I don’t understand why everyone acts like they did something novel.<p>On a personal note, I’ve been a happy user of Regus for nearly a decade and I can’t imagine switching to WeWork. The WeWork offices I’ve been to are large open offices or glass-walled. They have better kitchenettes but not astronomically better.

"&gt; I think a big problem is you grab a library and you really have no idea what you&#x27;ve gotten. Maybe it has a label. It says it&#x27;s 1.2, but you don&#x27;t know which functions inside it have changed, or why. You don&#x27;t actually know what you&#x27;re running. And maybe the jar file or artifact tells you something about the source that was used to produce it, but the process that was used to produce it is often opaque. And any of that could be wrong because there&#x27;s a lot of human steps involved in producing artifacts. And because so many people use Git, I&#x27;d like to get closer to leveraging some of the features there, in particular using SHA&#x27;s and content-based addressing to talk about things.<p>&gt; I had worked on a library called Codeq, which we&#x27;ll have a new version of soon, that sort of extends the Git model down to the function level, so you would have SHA&#x27;s for individual functions, and you could have dependencies on functions, instead of on artifacts. So a lot of work is happening around that, and some of that manifests itself in this dependency tool."

"I have never understood why proofs are always required. Usually when you have an unproven theorem and it works often enough, to me it&#x27;s good enough for most of what you&#x27;re doing, for example in applied math. Of course if you find places where an unproven theorem doesn&#x27;t work, it becomes interesting to why it doesn&#x27;t work, and it&#x27;s usually a big discovery, but it doesn&#x27;t really disprove a theorem, it just helps to refine it.<p>I remember that in school teachers were often insisting about giving a proof to something, but to me it often made enough sense and it was often right, and it was often frustrating to have teachers tell you &quot;no&quot;. It felt like a burden of proof."

Jack Dorsey provides a statement defining who their group is: &quot;The Illuminati is an underground organization of child rapists and homosexuals.&quot; Matthew Porter: &quot;We have to thin the herd, so Barack is going to explain a few things.&quot; At 232 Barack Obama says the following: &quot;You people have to realize we are child rapists. The Illuminati are child rapists. As soon as you figure that out, you can decide what to do. Everybody is freaking out about what just happened [child raping event still going on].

Ironically, this is usually done through a receivership transfer, where you receive the funds after four or more day, and it can be pulled at the last second, whch is usually the case, after you&#x27;ve done them the &quot;service&quot;.<p>A word about the &quot;f@\&amp;&amp;ot&quot; usage: it was a necessary tool. It showed three things: they were not in control, if they were the usage would have be stopped. Everyone out there needed to see t%his. Two, it made it unpleasant for them to be in the headspace, which has obvious advantages. Three, it pointed out impersonators of BS because they would not call each other f@%%ot, thus helping to mitigate the spread of false information. Apologies for those unintentionally offended.<p>Of special interest to the LGBT community, I give you Barack Obama in a foursome with Peter Thiel, Jack Dorsey, and Matthew Porter.

"YAML (&#x2F;ˈjæməl&#x2F;, rhymes with camel[2]) was first proposed by Clark Evans in 2001,[10] who designed it together with Ingy döt Net[11] and Oren Ben-Kiki.[11] Originally YAML was said to mean Yet Another Markup Language,[12] referencing its purpose as a markup language with the yet another construct, but it was then repurposed as YAML Ain&#x27;t Markup Language, a recursive acronym, to distinguish its purpose as data-oriented, rather than document markup."

"Interesting idea (congrats on launching) and interesting discussion here.  Reading this thread has popped up some questions in my mind and I&#x27;m curious to hear thoughts:<p>Why do we (aka society aka the police) test for specific substance quantities at all?  Really, I think, what we care about is whether someone is able to competently perform the task of driving at a given moment.<p>If you are unable to perform that task, then you should be removed from the road (and, possibly, punished).<p>Frankly, I don&#x27;t really care whether you&#x27;re drunk, high, tired, distracted from texting or even if you&#x27;re just a plain &#x27;ol bad driver.  The net result is the same - you&#x27;re an increased risk to others on (and off) the road and your risk should be mitigated.<p>This gets to the root of a number of related issues - the fact that different bodies react to different levels of chemicals in different ways, etc. etc.<p>If you&#x27;re able to function at a given moment, fine by me.  If your driving is compromised for whatever reason (as demonstrated by a field sobriety test), then off the road you go.<p>Thoughts &#x2F; corrections &#x2F; slap-downs?"

"This is known in the education space, and tests like the JLPT N5-N1 are based on this! Also when learning English, the learning material and exams are based on this. The order of frequency is not strictly followed though, if you have to learn &quot;Monday&quot; now and &quot;Tuesday&quot; in a couple of days, it makes sense to  bundle them all by concepts at once and learn &quot;getsukasuimokukindonichi&quot;. So in Japanese learning, on a day-to-day it might seem like you learn random difficult-easy words or characters, but overall you only have to _memorize_ the top N characters&#x2F;words for the next test and you&#x27;d be alright.<p>I made a free website to memorize Kanji that works offline: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;core.cards&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;core.cards&#x2F;</a>. Initially I did maintain a list of the top 100, top 500, and top 1000 (approx) if I recall correctly, extracted from Wikipedia lists, to learn Japanese Kanji. But now I&#x27;ve switched it to just follow the JLPT because they were almost the same."

"&gt; Surprisingly, the root cause of bad software has less to do with specific engineering choices, and more to do with how development projects are managed. The worst software projects often proceed in a very particular way:<p>&gt; The project owners start out wanting to build a specific solution and never explicitly identify the problem they are trying to solve. ...<p>At this point, it looks like the article will reveal specific techniques for problem identification. Instead, it wraps this nugget in a lasagna of other stuff (hiring good developers, software reuse, the value of iteration), without explicitly keeping the main idea in the spotlight at all times.<p>Take the first sentences in the section &quot;Reusing Software Lets You Build Good Things Quickly&quot;:<p>&gt; Software is easy to copy. At a mechanical level, lines of code can literally be copied and pasted onto another computer. ...<p>By the time the author has finished talking about open source and cloud computing, it&#x27;s easy to have forgotten the promise the article seemed to make: teaching you how to identify the problem to be solved.<p>The section returns to this idea in the last paragraph, but by then it&#x27;s too little too late:<p>&gt; You cannot make technological progress if all your time is spent on rebuilding existing technology. Software engineering is about building automated systems, and one of the first things that gets automated away is routine software engineering work. The point is to understand what the right systems to reuse are, how to customise them to fit your unique requirements, and fixing novel problems discovered along the way.<p>I would re-write this section by starting with a sentence that clearly states the goal - something like:<p>&quot;Paradoxically, identifying a software problem will require your team to write software. But the software you write early will be quite different than the software you put into production. Your first software iteration will be a guess, more or less, designed to elicit feedback from your target audience and will deliberately built in great haste. Later iterations will solve the real problem you uncover and will emphasize quality. Still, you cannot make technical progress, particularly at the crucial fact-gathering stage, if all your time is spent on rebuilding existing technology. Fortunately, there are two powerful sources of prefabricated software you can draw from: open source and cloud computing.&quot;<p>The remainder of the section would then give specific examples, and skip the weirdly simpleminded introductory talk.<p>More problematically, though, the article lacks an overview of the process the author will be teaching. Its lack makes the remaining discussion even harder to follow. I&#x27;ll admit to guessing the author&#x27;s intent for the section above.<p>Unfortunately, the entire article is structured so as to prevent the main message (&quot;find the problem first&quot;) from getting through. As a result, the reader is left without any specific action to take today. S&#x2F;he might feel good after having read the article, but won&#x27;t be able to turn the author&#x27;s clear experience with the topic into something that prevents more bad software from entering the world."

Fun fact: there is exactly one situation in the United States in which you are required to fly with non-TSA approved locks on your luggage. That situation is when there&#x27;s a gun in your checked in bags. The easiest way to meet that requirement is with a flare gun. Some perfectly reasonable people that are concerned about theft and privacy will travel with a flare gun for no reason other than it lets them lock their luggage.<p>The rules around flying are weird and full of perverse incentives that are easily hacked.
Wizard of Oz prototypes aren&#x27;t meant to scale...
"Here are some hard economic truths. Both parents work. That’s a big part of it. Women have joined men in the corporate workforce and are encouraged to work 10 hour days and move up the corporate ladder. This together with automation and outsourcing and trickle down economics (eg lower capital gains tax than income tax) has contributed to wage stagnation. In the past, taking care of children was indirectly valued economically, because in many households, there was a division of labor and only one parent was available to work for the market.<p>So now it takes both parents to pay the same rent that one breadwinner could pay before. Now that both parents are trading a large part of their time to work for corporations instead of taking care of kids, most of the kids are being put in a public school - it has become essentially a glorified daycare center to watch the kids while the parents work. So the work is outsourced to professionals in the school zoned for their residence (nevermind failing schools). They are told to sit down and shut up for 8-10 hours a day. The teachers are told not to do anything rash if the kids act out. There is not much they can do to stop it. The kids that are too troublesome are put in special ed and&#x2F;or medicated with ADD medications that are chemically similar to methamphetamines.<p>Working adults also do this to their parents sometimes, putting them in nursing homes which keep them medicated if they are too anxious.<p>Sadly, it gets worse. There is an opioid epidemic among men and a quarter of middle aged women are taking antidepressants. People are lonely, often living alone without family or village, getting amazon or food deliveries, speaking for 5 seconds with the delivery person, and no one knows most of their neighbors.<p>We in the US need to have a hard look at our society instead of medicating everyone.<p>A major step forward would be a UBI and a 30 hour workweek. Men AND women can be amazing parents to their children and caretakers to their own parents if given the chance economically.<p>PS: And the animals too, we need to end factory farming and overuse of antibiotics and thinking it’s ok. This is a sick society."

"I&#x27;ve heard this mentioned a few years ago in a TV report on dogs used in labs that test evidence for criminal trials. Their procedure was to let the dog <i>alone</i> into a special scent-free room that contained the sample being tested, plus a few control ones. The samples were placed into containers that only let the smell out (no visual cues, even though the samples were identical-looking cotton swabs).<p>Also, I vaguely remember a high-profile case where the evidence was dismissed precisely because the procedures for gathering and testing the samples were not followed."
"I&#x27;m sorry, but I&#x27;ll have to state my discontent with your product. Firstly, I question it&#x27;s usability from the beginning. How accurate is it? Can you get something similar to a BAC with it? Also how often&#x2F;likely is it that a false positive will happen? More importantly I fear that the &quot;Cannabis Breathalyzer&quot; will become like a polygraph, which can&#x27;t tell whether your actually lying or not, but is merely used as a tool by police that&#x27;s used against people. Comparing Alcohol to Cannabis also isn&#x27;t right. These are <i>vastly</i> different chemicals with different effects on people. Over ~10000 people died in 2017 from alcohol impaired driving[0], can anything remotely similar be said of Cannabis? Don&#x27;t get me wrong driving under the influence of any drug can be dangerous, and is why on most prescription bottles you&#x27;ll have a &quot;Do not operate heavy machinery&quot; warning on it, but that doesn&#x27;t stop everyone on medication from driving. Prohibiting Cannabis has caused much grief in the past that this tool, without accurate results and proper use, is likely going to cause more harm than good.

There still has to be a standard text format, but only for the source from which the live configs have to be built.  Done right, this has several advantages:<p>1. Built-time validation (or at least type checking).<p>2. Built configs can be easy to parse but (potentially) rich enough to avoid confusing templating.<p>3. Separation of concerns between storing&#x2F;maintaining configs and applying them.  E.g. scoop text configs off a source repo, but send out binary configs over the network.<p>All this is a fantasy in my head.  Right now the closest mainstream thing is protobufs.  But they make trade-offs for non-config use cases, and thus don&#x27;t really cut it in the &quot;... rich enough to avoid confusing templating&quot; department."

Equally, the author doesn&#x27;t ask &quot;why&quot; - why would it take so long, why was that option enabled?"
Hooks still show up without variable names associated with them (I say still because I was using this before release). I assumed they would try to find a way around it. In the current state the hooks support is useless.

"I can&#x27;t remember in which version of encarta, but when I was young I spent hours on those 3D recreations of famous places travels.

"It’s easy to be sentimental about Tumblr now, but as we grow increasingly aware of the ability for social media to create echo chambers that radicalize people, it shouldn’t be forgotten that Tumblr is in many ways one of the worst examples of this phenomenon. And this was no more abundantly clear than during its porn heyday. I don’t regret the downfall of Tumblr one bit."
"What I liked about the current KSP is that everything is real. NASA actually sent a satellite to all of our Soler system&#x27;s planets. They actually developed a rover that can drive on the moon, and they preformed rendezvous with two spaceships. They also had to deal with a finite amount of fuel and parts that could be destroyed if there was too much pressure or heat on them.<p>Now with colonies and mining it is less realistic and more sci-fi. I can see the appeal of that, but it is a different appeal. I would have preferred that they spent energy developing things to make it more realistic. For example, Lagrange points, different forms of propellents, n body physics, automation, ets. Recently with Bereshit I learned that before (certain?) rockets can fire their main engines they have to fire small ones to provide acceleration in order to move the fuel in the big tank closer to the main engine. It would have been nice if KSP also took that into account.<p>On an unrelated topic, I wonder how KSP 2 will make multiplayer work with timewarp"

"I work very far from my office, and on the 1-2 days a week I do go in, it&#x27;s an hour and a half each way. For the wife, it&#x27;s 2 full hours each way. Totally not worth it day to day, but it&#x27;s a nice change of pace for the 1-2 days I go in. Keeps things fresh, and I take a bus the whole way there.<p>That being said, if my job was, say, a 20 minute commute, I&#x27;d go in probably 3 or 4 days a week, assuming the office was nice. I prefer working in person at times, it really depends on what I&#x27;m doing, but the option is what makes it work for me. 100% remote would only make me happy for so long, I think.<p>Also, rarely discussed in these types of posts is that your social abilities definitely diminish if you work from home a lot and rarely interact with people.

But once they found out, they fired him, and he started claiming he owned equity and&#x2F;or was owed severance.<p>They want the money back, him made to shut up, and possibly drawn-and-quartered.<p>So it doesn&#x27;t look like this is much broader than that .. again - according to the doc."
"I read the article and tried to read the linked study (paywall). But I see no mention of the &#x27;random&#x27; part of this outside the introductory paragraph.

I don&#x27;t really know since I can&#x27;t read the study.<p>But I think I strongly disagree with the premise. I think picking stocks at random is likely to lead to uninterested investors who may lose interest in frequent contributions to their stock accounts as they have no personal connection or awareness or interest in the location or use of their funds.<p>Yes, diversification is important, but so is awareness.

"&gt; We’re constantly working to detect and stop this type of activity because we don’t want our services to be used to manipulate people. We’re taking down these Pages, Groups and accounts based on their behavior, not the content they posted. As with all of these takedowns, the people behind this activity coordinated with one another and used fake accounts to misrepresent themselves, and that was the basis for our action.<p>To suggest that the practices of facebook in general - likes, the activity feed, and various experiments that facebook has in its history - is not itself an attempt by a coordinated group to manipulate people, is itself disingenuous at best.  In order to correct this to honesty, they would have to clarify that they don&#x27;t care for external groups - other than those who pay for advertising services - to be permitted to manipulate people.<p>This take down of a few pages being followed by 15k people and its subsequent information release is itself a manipulation, to make it appear as if facebook is doing something about the glaring problems that I personally think it represents.  It seems to me that in the halls of power today, there are few good actors, and this tiny morsel doesn&#x27;t make facebook one of them, and does nothing about the manipulators on their platforms that are beyond their ability to take down, despite self-serving dishonesty from so many groups.<p>In other words, what a skillfully crafted news release from facebook, give that marketer a raise."

"Skimming through the docs, even though warts of postal addressing are mentioned, this seems like a (base-14?) encoding of geocodes rather than unified hierarchical postal addressing (which is still an accomplishment, and something I can see a need for). Though this seems to work for latin scripts only I guess.<p>For actually representing global postal addressing schemes with all warts and historic practices, I know no better standard than UPU S-1. I had a project for (partially) implementing it for a large logistics provider ten years ago. It was one of the few cases where using XML for business data genuinely made sense, as addresses could be represented in a line-oriented format (as you&#x27;d write on a postal piece) and at the same time structured info in the address (postcodes, streets, house numbering tokens) could be tagged for extraction, validation, etc. Though to make end-of-line chars significant in XML (which we had to somehow because postcodes are often placed at the begin or end of a line in formal addresses) we had to represent addresses basically as address_line_1, adress_line_2, etc. SGML could&#x27;ve handled this much more elegantly, as not only can it assign meaning to line breaks via short references, it also (theoretically) allows representation of overlapping (concurrent) tagging structures for two or more vocabularies."

"Mom cried.<p>She used to be a librarian. Then she was a geographer. The old school kind, the one that actually drew actual maps. The librarian skills really came in handy when drawing real maps. Everything <i>had</i> to be right. People could get lost in the wilderness and be using your map, or countries could be drawing international borders based on your map, war could break out over your mistakes. The printers and early dot-matrix printers put her whole department out of business though. That was fine, my siblings and I came along about then anyway.<p>I was too young to remember, but I think it was Encarta 95. I remember standing there next to Mom as she fired up the new program, my sister sat on her lap. She wasn&#x27;t very tech savy, still isn&#x27;t. We helped her out a bit with the mouse and clicking into everything.<p>We looked up East Germany first thing. Mom wanted to make sure Encarta was correct, right, true. We knew East Germany wasn&#x27;t a thing anymore, even though a lot of the maps in school and in our children&#x27;s books were saying it still was a thing. It took a while back then for things to percolate. Mom wanted to make sure this thing was as up to date as possible.<p>She typed it in, it took us to an index page, Mom clicked on the top listing (I think). We read a bit about East Germany. It had an end date. Mom was happy. This resource will do for her family. Then there was a bit of text that was underlined. Mom hovered over the underlined text. It said to click on the underlined text to go to that page. My sister squirmed a bit.<p>Mom clicked and then the internet came crashing into our house like an asteroid or an artillery shell or an earthquake; the floor was left behind. <i>Everything</i> changed in an instant.<p>It took us, automatically, to the linked page. I think I was about unified Germany. But it did it instantly. Boom, there you were. Reading.<p>Mom cried.<p>It was at that moment that Mom understood. No more card catalogs. No more having to hunt the shelves. No more having to look in the index for the page numbers, jamming your fingers in the back while you flipped through the tome. No more walking and sitting back down. No more having to ask strangers to watch your bags while you went diving into the stacks. No more checked out books you were looking for.<p>Just. Click. And.

"The thing is, 90% coverage is not that great. What happens is that you understand common words that make up for a lot of structure, but when an uncommon word appears it&#x27;s probably important to the sentence.

"For both wired and wireless, it&#x27;s time for legislation to address exactly what it and isn&#x27;t permitted with regard to advertised speeds, throttling, and total usage -- both with respect to users, and with respect to peering.<p>It&#x27;s not just an issue of policy, but one of <i>transparency</i> too.<p>It&#x27;s a fact of life that more people will want to consume data than a network can support. So where are we going to make the cut? Diminish everyone&#x27;s usage proportionally? Provide a guaranteed minimum? A minimum per minute, per hour, or per day? Prioritize traffic based on type? Implement caps? Allow people to pay for more speed, higher caps, or both?<p>Some of these will be better or worse for different users. But since people often have little or no choice over which carrier or ISP they use and switching can be expensive, this is exactly where it makes sense for policy to be made democratically, as with utilities. And publicized.<p>When I pay for a carrier, I want to know what I should be able to count on, and what I can&#x27;t count on."

"Maybe the fix is to require the submission to include the timestamp start and end. And if there is also copyrighted imagery, that the submission include black boxes around the restricted imagery (for video imagery the would include the timstamp start and end).<p>Then, the resolution would be to wipe out the original audio and black out any imagery similarly. Thus if a car drives by playing something copyrighted, it would simply cut the audio for a few seconds. No loss of revenue to the original poster. And beyond that, provide the video poster a chance to edit the video without the original sound&#x2F;images. If they re-upload it with the sound&#x2F;images still included, then they can have negative consequences for their account. If they re-upload with everything &quot;fixed&quot; then they shall have no negative marks on their permanent record."

"Seems like society is constantly pushing to remove all the ways in which kids used to live. Can&#x27;t just wonder around and play on the sidewalks or the streets anymore with your friends, someone will call the police on you. Can&#x27;t hang out in the woods, as those have mostly been torn down to make way for new neighborhoods, and the woods that do remain are typically private property. Unless you are lucky enough to live in a place that still has a good wooded area where there&#x27;s no busy bodies, you are out of luck. Can&#x27;t hang out at the mall, they will kick you out if you aren&#x27;t accompanied by an adult. Can&#x27;t hang out at your favorite local joints anymore, they&#x27;ll kick you out.

"Engineer &#x2F; engineering manager here.<p>Nicely articulated article. There is one observation that I respectfully disagree with - the one that says interviews are monotonous and boring.<p>I have done hundreds of interviews in my career and never found them to be boring. Perhaps one the reasons is I don&#x27;t do scripted interviews. It is always an exploration for me. I will start with simple questions and if I get good answers I will go deeper and deeper into the subject matter or into the adjacent area. If I don&#x27;t get good answers I will retract and probe another direction. This is sort of a depth-first traversal of candidate&#x27;s skills with a heuristic to stop traversing a particular branch if I see it is not a promising direction.<p>My goal is to discover the area where the candidate is the strongest (obviously within the areas I am interested in for the particular role I am hiring for). It is very fun and almost never boring. The experience is always different because people are never the same. Yes, some candidates are just not good, but even bad ones are bad in different ways.<p>I know common wisdom for using scripts is to have repeatable and comparable evaluations so that you can choose the best candidate. I understand the desire but I prefer to find the best in each candidate and if it means I have to use a lot of gut feeling and intuition to make the final decision then so be it, I believe it still results in better overall results. The idea to choose the person I want to hire based on how many answers to my standard questionnaire they got right was never appealing to me.<p>I can totally see how if you do scripted interviews it can become boring, so don&#x27;t. Interviews can be fun and it can be a creative process.<p>Another way interviews can be fun is if you find someone who has stronger skills than you do in a particular area. I love it when a candidate teaches me something new. Find where their strength is and let them shine."
"Spoilers:<p>&gt; Literally every single paper was either p-hacked, overfit, or a subsample of favourable data was selected (I guess ultimately they&#x27;re all the same thing but still) OR a few may have had a smidge of Alpha but as soon as you add transaction costs it all disappears.<p>&gt;  I should caveat that I was a profitable trader at multiple Tier-1 US banks so I can say with confidence that I made a decent attempt of building whatever the author was trying to get at."

"This seems a little underwhelming to me, it took several paragraphs and generic graphs to say: Senior developers are more independent, have more authority and influence, and work more on architectural problems.<p>I agree? Those are definitely necessary areas to master, but someone can achieve that without really being senior.<p>What I think makes someone actual senior is how they deal with failure. Anyone can show up and handle a task when they know how to do it and execute it correctly. When things go wrong is when seniority is important. Someone who has failed and watched others fail, seen servers go down, fixed critical bugs in production, made terrible estimates, over promised and underdelivered will have the thick skin you need. Failing and watching others fail is invaluable experience and cannot be taught in schools&#x2F;bootcamps. Approaching failures unemotionally, moving immediately to what the next steps need to be is a big part of what makes someone senior to me."
"That sounds nice. But while using U2F&#x2F;FIDO for a few years (with two HyperFIDOs, one for &quot;daily&quot; use attached to my key-chain, the other as a backup in a safe), I found the most common problem was that websites&#x2F;services don&#x27;t tread these keys as first class citizens. For example GitHub: I have my two keys setup there, but I can&#x27;t opt-out of SMS authentication.<p>If I knew I could use my keys at more services, I would already have upgrade the daily driver to a NFC variant (so I could use it with my phone).<p>So, to any webdevs on HN reading this: Take that shit serious and implement 2FA ;-)<p>&#x2F;&#x2F;edit: GitHub is just a single example; and it&#x27;s possible to opt-out of SMS, if a authenticator app is used instead.

"Web developers amaze me.<p>ALL (all) of the problems they face are either self-inflicted or due to other web developers, such as those who design web advertisements or bloated JavaScript libraries.

Rendering times are long because of the complexity that today&#x27;s sites are built to attain.<p>I can view simple sites EXTREMELY quickly today -- that is to say, sites that designers have not &quot;improved&quot; to the point that the site is no longer worth visiting.

I remember trying to puzzle out a lot of Popcorn’s menus and documentation since it was all in French.

"The best way I&#x27;ve seen this work (inside Google Apps) is to write shared business-logic in a common layer (here it (often) gets written in Java, then transpiled to Obj-&gt;C and Javascript, other teams go from C++ -&gt; Java &amp; JS, and other other teams embed JS inside of everything..  and other other other teams write everything in a native language (there is no one single way at Google))<p>then use a data-definition-language (like protobuffers) to define a bridge from inside of transpiled code land to your native layer, and compile native language bindings for your UI to read &amp; write data models.<p>then stack a mechanism like GRPC which takes the DDL to the next level and makes services a declarative, language agnostic definition... and compile your service stubs for each platform.<p>...then write the UI in a native layer for each platform, using the native service stubs and data models compiled from your DDL.<p>Once you start trying to abstract the UI models between iOS, Android, and web you are stuck with a shitty status quo solution that leads to terrible hacks or boring concessions that ignore platform differences.<p>However abstracting the common (non-ui) mechanisms like asynchronous data structures, sockets, and storage is a relatively solved problem."

"Not quite the same issue, but this reminds me of my very first job, back in 2001, where we used a homebrew C++ framework that separated lots of concerns, and then used a single massive .h file with 10,000 const uints to tie everything together.<p>Compiling took over 2 hours. The header was generated automatically, but after I added a macro that replaced those const uints with #defines, compile time dropped to 30 minutes, which was quickly voted the biggest productivity enhancement in that project.<p>More relevant to the topic, in javascript programming I recently switched to using const instead of let wherever possible. Most variables don&#x27;t actually vary, so let&#x27;s make that explicit. That can prevent some unexpected surprises (though not all, as objects and arrays in constants are not immutable)."

Not defending people who self-cite but here is an alternative explanation. There are many areas of science that have very few researchers working on the same or related problems.

"The problem is that dependent types (and the very idea of &quot;correctness by construction&quot;) suffer from fundamental, serious limitations -- both in theory and in practice -- that the author does not seem to be aware of. He also does not seem to be aware of all the <i>other</i> approaches for software verification and correctness (sound static analysis, model checking, concolic testing) that have so far shown greater promise, and formal methods research focuses on them rather than on dependent types (the approach that scales least and suffers from the most limitations); in fact, last I spoke with a dependent type researchers, he told me that now they&#x27;re trying to <i>weaken</i> the soundness of their type systems (sort of gradual-dependent-types) to try and fight the problems types suffer from. I&#x27;m not saying dependent types don&#x27;t have some uses, or that they won&#x27;t change enough so they could play a central role in software correctness, but thinking that they&#x27;re the future of software correctness (in their current form) shows a complete lack of familiarity with this field."

"This might be throwing a lit match into a gasoline refinery, but why not opt for XML in some circumstances?<p>Between its strong schema and wsdl support for internet standards like soap web services, XML covers a lot of ground that Json encoding doesn&#x27;t necessarily have without add-ons.<p>I say this knowing this is an unfashionable opinion and XML has its own weaknesses, but in the spirit of using web standards and LoC approved &quot;archivable formats&quot;, IMO there is still a place for XML in many serialization strategies around the computing landscape.<p>Json is perfect for serializing between client and server operations or in progressive web apps running in JavaScript. It is quite serviceable in other places as well such as microservice REST APIs, but in other areas of the landscape like middleware, database record excerpts, desktop settings, data transfer files, Json is not much better or sometimes even slightly worse than XML."

"I like Julia a lot, but the lack of row indices for the data frames is very annoying. I’m used to pandas and saddle and row indices are essential. Can they express anything just columns cannot?

Also the performance is pretty good to.<p>Also I don’t like the begin&#x2F;end block delimiters, but it’s not a huge deal.

"Excellent article, well grounded in the reality of software development. New developers and managers would benefit from understanding the practical points made here as early as possible.<p>I do think perhaps there is too much emphasis on reuse and particularly cloud services. Ironically, this is partly for the reasons given elsewhere in the article. If you rely on outsourcing important things, you also naturally outsource the deep understanding of those important things, which can leave you vulnerable to problems you didn&#x27;t anticipate. Also, any integration is a source of technical debt, so dependencies on external resources can be more fragile than they appear, and if something you rely on changes or even disappears then that is a new kind of potentially very serious problem that you didn&#x27;t have to deal with before. Obviously I&#x27;m not advocating building every last thing in-house in every case, but deciding when to build in-house and when to bring something in can be more difficult than the article here might suggest."

A person that wants to learn something will also learn it regardless of whether they have mentor.<p>The role of mentor is to expedite the process, help avoid dead ends or bad habits and generally make the end result better and faster than without mentor.<p>I can learn to be Enterprise Architect or play flute on my own, but having a mentor makes it easier for me.<p>I pay for a flautist to teach me but really I don&#x27;t want him to teach me. I teach flute myself and the flautist is to point out errors, tips that help me learn it faster, his experience of how he learned it, all to let me reach goals that I set with less effort.<p>The problem people have is the moment they get a &quot;teacher&quot; they assume some kind of shared responsibility or even expectation that the student will somehow offload part of the effort onto the &quot;teacher&quot;. That is simply wrong."

"React DevTools are very valuable.<p>But only because React, with transpiling and the shadow DOM and all that is so inscrutable.<p>There’s no hope of understanding the DOM with React, no hope of understanding styles with styled-components.
There’s no hope of placing a breakpoint in your code and tracing forward through events. No hope of understanding stack traces.<p>The DevTools begin to address some of those deficiencies. It does help, but still leaves me thinking the tradeoffs weren’t worth it. You can never reach simplicity, only manageable complexity. In the long run it leaves an opportunity for a new generation of tools that respect JavaScript and the DOM."
"Almost 1 MB of JavaScript transferred to render a single chart? I am afraid that is not acceptable.

Hire and work hard to keep the best managers and engineers you can.&quot; As they mention, accumulating knowledge is important. Keeping that knowledge around is therefore also important (and sometimes difficult). The best managers will know what technical debt is, how to handle pressure from higher-ups, and how to keep a team happy, healthy and productive."
"I only read an excerpt of the article, but it seems to me that it might be tough to attribute the false detection to a certain variable within the animal&#x27;s cognition.

I mean, i could understand if the railroad used it for their own uses, which from a functional perspective, i understand and agree...But for this railroad to turn around and authorize others - and I&#x27;m sure they charge everyone for this! - to then use that land, just seems sort of unfair.  I understand that it&#x27;s &quot;convenient&quot; for other entities to only work with that single entity; but that still seems a monopoly to me.  So, forevermore, the Union Pacific railroad will get money for use of this land, that they were given so many years ago; well, that sucks."

"I had Encarta &#x27;97 as an 11yo, purchased at a Malaysian street vendor market for probably all of 3 bucks. It felt incredible to have that much knowledge available for almost no money. And it wasn&#x27;t just boring text like the paper versions, there were videos too!<p>There was  point in time where that truly felt like the future. Considering that we&#x27;re now in the age of autoplaying, monetized &quot;content&quot; video nearly everywhere you go, it was nice to have only &quot;primary source&quot; video, aka stuff like the moon landing, or the MLK speech, instead of some nobody warbling on about its importance while splicing in stills of said video because they don&#x27;t want to be in violation of the copyright.<p>The concept of finite, structured and bounded content is also extremely powerful in this era of overwhelming data, much of which rehashed and warmed over by various publications not to mention utterly infested with ads.<p>The concept of spending hours down a Wikipedia rabbit hole is not new, and it&#x27;s one of the reasons I donate annually.

The argument seems to be that not-censoring things is valuable because who knows when Cloudflare censors something that is actually valuable&#x2F;not racist or nationalist.<p>Considering tech companies tend to censor right-wing extremist content, I consider the probability of that happening to be very low."
"Very interesting. I&#x27;ve tried to read some texts and I could easily understand them (as a native Polish speaker). I wonder if it is as easy for other Slavic  nationalities. If so, it could be a nice intermediary language, if only for written texts.

It could be tried in museums, restaurants, etc."

"I agree fully with the desire for resilience throughout the kernel, especially in today&#x27;s world.

Everyone could upstream a half arsed driver for something and it would get fixed while people use it and encounter bugs. Now that Linux is used professionally everywhere that just isn&#x27;t feasible anymore.<p>On another note, I remember that some time ago there was a talk about Linux file system fuzzing given at some conference and ext4 fared the best by far, which is why I&#x27;m still using that exclusively, although some of the features of btrfs would come in handy at times."

Can&#x27;t find a proper source, but afforestation, when done together with habitat restoration, can be even cheaper than these numbers, when done in certain areas of Africa, South America and Central Asia.<p>If Stripe wants to go the proverbial extra mile, it should consider &quot;educating&quot; people on the subject AND take consequent action, as opposed to &quot;just&quot; taking action following conventional wisdom.<p>[0]: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fas.org&#x2F;sgp&#x2F;crs&#x2F;misc&#x2F;R40562.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fas.org&#x2F;sgp&#x2F;crs&#x2F;misc&#x2F;R40562.pdf</a><p>[1]: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fs.fed.us&#x2F;pnw&#x2F;pubs&#x2F;pnw_gtr888.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fs.fed.us&#x2F;pnw&#x2F;pubs&#x2F;pnw_gtr888.pdf</a> (afforestation &quot;price&quot; starting at ~$50&#x2F;ton)"

"I think I was 7 when I first got hold of it. It was installed on my Dad&#x27;s work laptop and since using it, I would beg him every week to leave his laptop at home. Among my memories was spending time going over the virtual tours. Encarta had this feature that allowed you to take either a 360 tour, or a full immersive 3D virtual tour of a historical building. I remember my favourites being the Abu Simbel and Persepolis tours. Another feature I miss were the interactive quizzes (only available on Encarta Kids) and that creepy trivia game. One of my past times as a kid was going home from school and studying for these quizzes, reading dozens upon dozens of Encarta articles then later trying my luck on beating my high score. A couple years later, we finally got internet connection and the hobby died down. While the internet provided a wider library of knowledge, it never gave me a platform to cultivate and test my interest for devouring trivias as much as Encarta."

Is this the timespan you plan your reliable infrastructure for? And how &quot;green&quot; is it to build these batteries?<p>If you think pumped-storage hydroelectricity, how much places do you have where you can have two pools (one uphill, one downhill) to store the water? How much energy can store in there?<p>The thing is, you&#x27;ll build all these solar and wind farms and then still build and run the fossil plants, because you aren&#x27;t able to store the energy to make it reliable enough."

My problem is the assumption that it’s unacceptable for an extension (which has a native messenger) to have the capability to modify Firefox when <i>explicitly told to by the user</i>. I use tridactyl, and plenty of people do, but realistically, the entire audience of an extension that gives you vim keys is highly technical, and can be expected to read the docs. Making the software edit personal files on disk when <i>not asked to explicitly by the user</i> is a breach of my trust model. It’s not as though fixamo is run on startup, it’s something you have to do explicitly. I’ve never run it, nor do I use the native messenger.

"The relationship between the architect of a building and its general contractor is no different than it is in software: acrimony, with each thinking the other is wrong on most fronts. General contractors believe their experience gives them superior insight into how something should be built, and that architects make impossible-to-implement plans. Architects take great care to make precise decisions on hundreds of dimensions, ranging from cost engineering to air quality, aesthetics in the context of then, now, and the life of the built environment, and scoff when plans aren&#x27;t followed. Somehow, usually, through a lot of bickering and change orders, things turn out alright.<p>The architect absorbs vast information and designs a solution, the builder makes it into reality, often making meaningful and lasting decisions during implementation. Both are competent and valuable. Sure there are design-build people and teams, sometimes they work very well. Architects will always have more context in the realm of ideas, that is the space they occupy. Builders have the most context in implementation, and may detect issues that make the whole plan invalid. Collaboration helps. Mistrust doesn&#x27;t.<p>Architects don&#x27;t have to swing a hammer to know where the planks should go, but boy it sure does help if they have."

" This isn’t anything new. In my 90s middle school and high school, the official policy of my school was that we would have an hour of homework per academic class each day.  We got out of school at 3:30.

"I was very excited to try this. Particularly as a hypersocial super-connector, I&#x27;ve dreamed about my ideal personal CRM.<p>What I want is:<p>* The ability to do something like a spaced repetition with my contacts. If it proposes I connect with someone, and I&#x27;m like &quot;great&quot;, they stay high priority. Or I can snooze that contact for a little while or a long while. (There might be an orthogonal feature to track who is important but I only need infrequent contact with.)<p>* The ability to accurately search my contacts. e.g. Friends who are into crypto and art.<p>So I went all in on Dex for ten minutes and granted read permissions for my calendar + contacts and added the extension access to read and change data on all websites.<p>The results were pretty underwhelming. It showed me a handful of contacts scraped from Google, many of which I didn&#x27;t even recognize. I understand that this is perhaps I&#x27;m not much of an email guy, so I do know that a scrape of my Google contacts (or even my emails) will poorly reflect my social graph.<p>Here&#x27;s what I want:<p>* Scrape and import my contacts across all platforms. If you need to use a Chrome extension to read my Facebook activity (not the messages, but just the people involved), fine. If you want me to spend 20 minutes downloading Facebook exports that don&#x27;t include message text, or maybe screenshotting my message feed subjects for Facebook and Instagram and emailing them to you to OCR, to avoid you being liable for TOS breaking, fine.<p>* Auto-tag contacts, and allow me to update my tags.<p>* Auto-prioritize my contacts, and allow me to update the priorities.<p>Dex isn&#x27;t really what I need, but thank you. I appreciate you trying to solve this problem.<p>[edit: Give me a Chrome extension to take screenshots of pages with key information about my social graph, whenever I browse onto them, that will then find sensitive info like message text and black them over and then allow me to easily email them to you?]"

I love stuff like this.  This is like the 5th or 6th time I&#x27;ve seen 3D techniques from the past become real time relevant.  The first one I saw was from the 50&#x27;s and someone just happened to explore it and it happened to run great on modern hardware.  I bet there is a ton of stuff out there like this.  I do wish there was more of a benchmarking standard.  It is great that it now runs in 20ms on his laptop but that says nothing about the actual computational requirements.

"This is one of the most concise tutorials on how generators, coroutines and futures&#x2F;promises are related (from first principles) that I&#x27;ve seen.<p>I&#x27;m hopeful that eventually promises and async&#x2F;await fade into history as a fad that turned out to be too unwieldy. I think that lightweight processes with no shared memory, connected by streams (the Erlang&#x2F;Elixer, Go and Actor model) are the way to go. The advantage to using async&#x2F;await seems to be to avoid the dynamic stack allocation of coroutines, which can probably be optimized away anyway. So I don&#x27;t see a strong enough advantage in moving from blocking to nonblocking code. Or to rephrase, I don&#x27;t see the advantage in moving from deterministic to nondeterministic code. I know that all of the edge cases in a promise chain can be handled, but I have yet to see it done well in deployed code. Which makes me think that it&#x27;s probably untenable for the mainstream.<p>So I&#x27;d vote to add generators to the Rust spec in order to make coroutines possible, before I&#x27;d add futures&#x2F;promises and async&#x2F;await. But maybe they are all equivalent, so if we have one, we can make all of them, not sure."

"Cloud NAT would be fine except it costs 4.5¢ per GB (in both directions) which could hurt some use cases. If your backend VMs pull in more than 64.8 GB per month from the Internet it&#x27;s cheaper to just pay for the public IP. (Only applies to outbound connections initiated by the VM, inbound connections through load balancers don&#x27;t go through the NAT.)<p>I&#x27;ll echo what others have said - it sucks that they&#x27;re doing this before adding IPv6 support. A good portion of traffic could bypass the NAT entirely considering how many services support IPv6 these days.<p>They don&#x27;t start charging until April, so maybe they&#x27;ll surprise us with an IPv6 announcement before then, but I&#x27;m not betting on it. :("
"Little Big Adventure is painted down in the article, but it is also a masterpiece.

A recent example is Pixar’s film Finding Dory, which featured a blue tang fish (Paracanthurus hepatus) as the main character and was widely reported in the popular press to have increased the number of such fish in the pet trade. We use Bayesian posterior predictive counterfactual models to evaluate the movie’s effect on three metrics of societal behaviour. Although there was an increase in global online searches for the blue tang 2–3 weeks after the movie, we find no substantial evidence for an increase in imports of blue tang fish into the US, or in number of visitors to US aquaria compared to counterfactual expectations. It is vital that an evidence-based discourse is used when communicating potential impacts of popular culture on human-wildlife relationships to avoid loss of credibility and misdirection of conservation resources."

By Robert W. Service<p>There&#x27;s a race of men that don&#x27;t fit in,
A race that can&#x27;t stay still;
So they break the hearts of kith and kin,
And they roam the world at will.
They range the field and they rove the flood,
And they climb the mountain&#x27;s crest;
Theirs is the curse of the gypsy blood,
And they don&#x27;t know how to rest.<p>If they just went straight they might go far;
They are strong and brave and true;
But they&#x27;re always tired of the things that are,
And they want the strange and new.
They say: &quot;Could I find my proper groove,
What a deep mark I would make!&quot;
So they chop and change, and each fresh move
Is only a fresh mistake.<p>And each forgets, as he strips and runs
With a brilliant, fitful pace,
It&#x27;s the steady, quiet, plodding ones
Who win in the lifelong race.
And each forgets that his youth has fled,
Forgets that his prime is past,
Till he stands one day, with a hope that&#x27;s dead,
In the glare of the truth at last.<p>He has failed, he has failed; he has missed his chance;
He has just done things by half.

Of course the model will have malicious users. Propaganda teams started testing its integration as soon as it was released. It&#x27;s likely that OpenAI is counting on this for insights into HOW the model can be used maliciously.

"fish shell is looking for a new text serialization format for its history file (currently it uses an ad-hoc broken psuedo-YAML).<p>Boxes to check:<p>1. Self describing format<p>2.

"TL;DR: a very entry-level article about the field of popgen (&quot;what is a genome?&quot;) and how the &quot;breakthrough&quot; is representing multiple sequence alignments as compact binary matrices. There&#x27;s very little explanation or actual examples beyond that, so unless you&#x27;re a complete layman the article probably won&#x27;t satiate you.<p>Applying deep learning to genomic data is something of a fad these days - the bioinformatics world has caught up with the DL hype of the early 2010s and is trying to use DL on nearly anything that moves for easy papers.<p>The main issue with DL frameworks in the context of genomics is the format of input data. You pretty much want all your data to be a matrix of fixed size (if you want to use CNNs at least, and that&#x27;s what everyone is interested in anyway), but that&#x27;s just not how genomics data works. Sequences vary in length (I see the problems of nucleotide gaps, let alone short indels is left unanswered), alignments are not absolute (they are very much aligner dependent and secondary alignments are a thing), the alignments themselves may stem from different data sources (long reads cover more stretches of DNA but are less reliable than short ones), there is no mention of how ploidy is handled (especially in plants!) and somehow you&#x27;re supposed to transform all of that into a neat 48x48 array to feed to Keras. Wait, thousands of them. Did I mention the human or plant genomes are often billions of basepairs long? Waiting for bwa to be done mapping on your cluster is the xkcd equivalent of &quot;can&#x27;t do work, compiling!&quot;<p>So yeah, sorry to put a damper on this but I&#x27;m waiting for something within the reach of practical workability (and believe me the standards of bioinformaticians for workable stuff are <i>low</i>) before getting hyped."

We ducked first into the alcove doorway of a restaurant and then sheltered inside at the bar for the evening eating tapas. Within the restaurant, fairly normal dining. Across the road, police with shields dealing with rioters and damaged property."

"This is what is called a &quot;positional arms race&quot;.  A comparable situation can be seen in football players and steroids.

"In my view, the predominant mistake made by those who seek to create profitable strategies is that they approach trading as if the market is a zero-sum game.  In particular, doing things that harm the markets, like naively adding to existing momentum, is just promoting price overshoot and instability by reinforcing positive feedback loops.  Such approaches hurt others and while they might make money for long periods of time, they will almost surely end up losing all that profit and more during a small number of extreme market events.<p>If you want to be reliably profitable, you need to first understand how the markets are not a zero-sum game and then you need to construct methods to improve the markets with your trading.  There are countless ways that markets deviate from truly efficient behavior.  Find some and develop strategies in areas that can benefit from your cognitive, experiential, and educational strengths.  General examples of how one might improve the markets include things like providing liquidity when it&#x27;s needed, limiting price overshoots when it&#x27;s warranted, and incorporating new information about instrument values. The market will pay you in return if you do such things in a sound way.  As long as you also do a good job of estimating and limiting your risk, you can be consistently profitable.<p>There will be no significant public disclosures of detailed ways to trade profitably.  The markets rely on the robustness provided by many different points of view addressing market needs in a variety of ways.  Any parties that overweight one of those points of view will ultimately lose money in the process of adding market instability.  There&#x27;s too much of that already.  Don&#x27;t trade until you figure out how to make the markets better."
"I&#x27;m not Italian... and am not meeting any productivity threshold.<p>But my work is incremental, and I obviously don&#x27;t want to repeat what I said in a different paper, so I cite earlier work in later work.

Your research is so popular that by the time you need to cite it, it&#x27;s been surveyed, or improved upon, or otherwise adapted.
2. You switch research subjects relatively often.
3. You publish &quot;blocks&quot; of work, each based on fundamentals in your field established by others - and they&#x27;re not incremental."

"I&#x27;d love to see some metrics on whether this idea has any merit. Because obviously any problem that can be done on a massive wafer can be done on multiple smaller wafers. The question is, are the compromises to get something working on a massive wafer killing performance to the point where just splitting the problem up efficiently would have been better. It&#x27;s also important to think: Stuff isn&#x27;t just going to happen to be the size to fit on this wafer, it&#x27;s either huge in scale, or not. If it&#x27;s not, you don&#x27;t need this wafer, if it is, you probably need to partition your problem onto multiple copies of this wafer anyway. Take their comparison to a Nvidia GPU. It might be 57 times bigger, but I can rent 1000 Nvidia GPUs from AWS at the drop of a hat (more or less).<p>So yes, maybe they&#x27;ve done some interesting stuff, but they need some decent benchmarks to show off before we can really distinguish between whether this is the Boeing 747 Dreamliner or a Spruce Goose."

"Like other people, the startup isn&#x27;t much of a problem to me since I can easily adapt (and even prefer) a REPL based development and for the stuff I use Julia that one time cost is more than worth it, but the problem of the initial JIT lag is that it affects the first impression of the language, which probably has a significant effect in adoption and good word of mouth from people who didn&#x27;t stay enough to appreciate the compromises being done.<p>Julia language development seems to be guided towards avoiding making damaging mistakes on the long run (for example focusing early on having a stable programmable multi-stage compilation, very efficient union-types and state of the art multithreading so the library ecosystem can grow with the correct assumptions). But the &quot;time to first plot&quot; is something that can be solved (regardless of it being hard or easy) at any time &quot;with no consequences&quot;, since libraries written with the expectation of a slow startup will work just as well when that problem is solved. Though the compiler team did acknowledge the issue and are prioritizing it post 1.3.<p>I do wonder if focusing on doing the very simple things well first (like python does right now), would be a better strategy, or it would just make people ignore the language because the simple things are already covered everywhere and not interesting enough for bringing people (compared to the amazing stuff Julia can do with supercomputers&#x2F;clusters and state of the art stuff like Zygote)."

"Leo Breiman [0] (inventor of bagging and random forests) wrote a paper called &quot;Statistical Modeling: The Two Cultures&quot; [1], and since I read it, I see it everywhere. The basic idea is that Statisticians place(d) too high an emphasis on model interpretability (&quot;data modeling&quot; in the paper), and as a result, missed out on the revolution of machine learning (&quot;algorithmic modeling&quot; in the paper). In the author&#x27;s words (parenthetical added by me), &quot;[T]he focus in the statistical community on data models (simple, interpretable models) has [l]ed to irrelevant theory and questionable scientific conclusions.&quot;<p>In this TDS post, the author says &quot;Statisticians and Actuaries are at the bottom of the heap as a prior role for existing data scientists.&quot; Maybe this isn&#x27;t a coincidence? Plenty of companies had statisticians on staff, but the explosion of data science happened anyway. Why? Because data scientists do the same types of tasks as statisticians, but while statisticians are of the data modeling culture, data scientists are expected to be of the algorithmic modeling culture. It seems that the market is saying that the algorithmic modeling culture is getting results.<p>The author references &quot;Type A vs Type B Data scientists&quot; [2], which seems to be getting at the same thing: &quot;The Type A Data Scientist is very similar to a statistician... Type B Data Scientists share some statistical background with Type A, but they are also very strong coders and may be trained software engineers.  The Type B Data Scientist is mainly interested in using data &quot;in production.&quot;  They build models which interact with users, often serving recommendations (products, people you may know, ads, movies, search results).&quot; For whatever reason, there is a correlation between Algorithmic modeling &#x2F; Type B and &quot;getting things done&quot;.<p>[0] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Leo_Breiman"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Leo_Breiman</a><p>[1] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;projecteuclid.org&#x2F;download&#x2F;pdf_1&#x2F;euclid.ss&#x2F;1009213726"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;projecteuclid.org&#x2F;download&#x2F;pdf_1&#x2F;euclid.ss&#x2F;100921372...</a><p>[2] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.quora.com&#x2F;What-is-data-science&#x2F;answer&#x2F;Michael-Hochster"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.quora.com&#x2F;What-is-data-science&#x2F;answer&#x2F;Michael-Ho...</a>"

"I am just wondering, why there is no similar product as FPGA array. As far as I know, it’s the cheapest way to see if there is product&#x2F;market fit for a semiconductor product. High speed transceiver as well as memory controllers are included in FPGA. This single wafer approach looks very interesting to me. I was intern at Infineon some time ago and was working on device distribution characterization across 200 mm wafer. The chips in the middle were 2-3 better performing than these in the border. So how Cerberas’s chip manages this issue? Middle parts are throttled or low performing areas near wafer’s boarder are disabled? How much does it cost?.. I can imagine it being shipped on thermal pad with liquid nitrogen cooling bellow. There must be some wires bonded for interface to the host. Very interesting technical project. I am very curious what are the clients for such huge specialized chip."
"Seems like one of the decisions a consumer should make, and not phone OS provider in this case.<p>My overall sentiment is that any actively enforced regulation, is often used as a weapon against competitors, or as a weapon to racketeer money from a business.<p>(whether it is privacy, patent enforcement, copy right enforcement, nondiscrimination and so on).<p>Therefore, what&#x27;s missing, generally, is the complimentary framework to to make sure that actively enforced policies are not abused.<p>I do not know how exactly those complimentary no-abuse laws would work, but I think they have to be part-and-parcel of every legislation, and should be voted for at the same time.<p>Without it, we do not have a truly &#x27;fair competition and instead business compete on whose team of lawyers is more creative and more aggressive."

"As a Nest owner with multiple cameras, I find it hilarious that no real features have been introduced in years, and this is what they come up with instead.<p>If they would spend more time shipping features I might not care as much but they have done nothing and instead they ship this stupid “feature”. They don’t allow us to train the cameras to ignore moving trees or shadows, repetitive noise like birds cawing, or fix their “familiar face” functionality. I’ve had complete strangers identified as being a familiar face, and I’ve also had cars identified as a familiar face.<p>Google is a terrible consumer product company."

"Most of the items on that guy&#x27;s &quot;todo&quot; list wouldn&#x27;t even qualify as &quot;work&quot; for me. For me meaningful work can only be accomplished in uninterrupted chunks of 2 hours or longer. There&#x27;s so much mental context, and it&#x27;s so complicated, it takes a lot of time to rebuild it. I do gnarly low level C&#x2F;C++ and assembly (for Intel, ARM and MIPS). &quot;Write a blog post&quot;, &quot;clean up one note&quot;. If I used One Note or wrote blog posts, those would just be background tasks while stuff compiles or tests&#x2F;benchmarks run."

"Just the fact that you will be profiting off of this perceived issue, means you have some interest in the root causes of impaired driving remaining unsolved. Reading statements like this just tells me you have dollar signs in your eyes:<p>&gt; we&#x27;re imagining a world where there are one of our devices in every police car in North America<p>Nowhere did I see a sentiment akin to this:<p>&gt; we&#x27;re imagining a world where people act more responsibly, driving deaths are reduced, etc<p>I think it would go a long way towards establishing more credibility and goodwill on your part if you pledged a not-insignificant % of revenue (not just profit) towards education, mental health and&#x2F;or civil rights efforts. At the end of the day, it is all citizens&#x27; tax dollars that will be used to pay you, so you should do the right thing and make those dollars work for them.<p>You should show that you&#x27;re actually using this as a step towards eradicating the root cause, not just profiting off of the perceived problem. Probably the best way for something like this to show it has helped society is if it ultimately obviates its own raison d&#x27;être, because the problem has been solved and thus the need for your palliative has vanished.<p>It&#x27;s like a doctor prescribing opiates vs solving the underlying issue of a patient&#x27;s pain, or psychiatric patients hooked on antidepressants. I&#x27;m sure there were plenty of execs dreaming of every pharmacy stocked with Oxy. These things may be helpful, but only as a step towards solving the underlying issue. When they become the end goal, people get hurt."
I always wonder what people who complain about the 9-5 feel should be the alternative.
This kind of thing is why I love that JRR Tolkien spent a whole introduction page lambasting people who read too much into symbolism in books and stating explicitly that Lord of the Rings was written as an exercise in long-form storytelling with no hidden meaning.

"It’s a giant political dodge that has nothing to do with the underlying issues. You want to know what’s the real cancer, the real drug these dealers don’t want you regulating? The NOTIFICATIONS. That’s something everyone on the inside knows. The average  person treats validating push notifications like a mouse getting cheese and will act out and continue to generate content to get it.<p>Look at the emails and push notifications these companies send out to regular people on a constant, daily basis, and you will find the cancer you’re looking for. Eliminating like counts and follower numbers is a nice idea that excites teenage activists but is pointless now that these companies have already built accounts with zillions of followers."
"I love remote work too. But I strongly believe it&#x27;s not for everyone. Not even 50% of the population. It would be a mistake to assume that it&#x27;s easy for everyone. For me, going in the office means putting my headset on and doing my work till I need to leave, while having as few interactions as possible; so there are pretty much only perks on working from home. Most people crave engagement without even realizing it.<p>It also really depends on the job and the company. If remote working means never going off, I think it&#x27;s a company culture problem rather than a problem of remote working itself. It might be true that since remote work is relatively new the boundaries and the culture might not be fully formed yet for many companies but I think everyone that works remotely should realize this and set expectations and boundaries accordingly."
You’d need international exposure on your national exchange.  Also by this logic multinationals should be solid investments but maybe they lack growth potential.

"I&#x27;ve been a daily cannabis user for over a decade. I have a prescription for this, like millions of others with prescriptions for psychoactive medications without driving limitations. Would you send someone to prison for driving because they took their Adderall that morning? Cannabis is not like alcohol in regard to impairment of motor function and decision-making under the influence. Surely the same concentrations of particulate correlate to different levels of impairment in different individuals. Of course it is possible for individuals to be impaired by cannabis to the extent that driving would be dangerous. There are many factors. I&#x27;m wary of a device that purports to determine actions as dangerous based on the the measure of some particulate in the breath."
"It sounds nice in theory but at such minute levels, you&#x27;re going to have tons of noise and variation from individual to individual. You&#x27;ll be able to produce a result, but it likely won&#x27;t have any bearing in reality.<p>In order to offset the noise you&#x27;ll need to increase your sample size (volume) of air. You can&#x27;t measure what isn&#x27;t there, and once you get down to these levels stuff stops becoming distributed uniformly.<p>Have fun becoming friends with the vendors who supply the police their other technology.

"It&#x27;s important to understand what SoftBank is, and why betting against them is a bad idea.<p>Globally we are going through a period of deflation.<p>Japanese Banks have been dealing with this problem for 30 years now.<p>BOJ can print money ( yen ) and flood the world and the value of the yen would still go up !<p>The reason is there is a lot of latent demand for Japanese exports.<p>When Softbank invests in lets say India, ( through Uber drivers ), and suffers losses.<p>The yens released ends ups creating demand for Japanese export.<p>From Softbank&#x27;s perspective it&#x27;s a win-win, they get to be owners of really important tech companies and at the same time  Japanese companies see a demand surge for their products.<p>It&#x27;s hard to understand initially - but don&#x27;t be surprised to see Softbank clones propping up in Europe in 10 years - once the EU has been completely battered by deflation.<p>In the US you might yet see the largest types of these funds in the future once the US govt. decides it wants some fiscal spending."

"no examples of &quot;unreasonable effectiveness&quot; or even &quot;effectiveness&quot; are given; just a semi-plausible technique and some questions that might be worth answering.

I would presume that not much meaning comes from neighboring mutations that are separated by a long string of no mutations, so the in-row locality should be broken into chunks. Neither of these basic considerations is motivated in the text either.<p>I would guess there is no effectiveness of CNN at all on this data set and a different statistical technique should be used on this data set..."

"This seems like a very slippery slope.<p>Recently Jackie Chan and Liu Yifei are a couple of higher profile individuals have expressed support for the mainland or condemnation of the protesters&#x27; riotous behavior. Jackie Chan is a Hong Kong national - Lieu Yifei is Chinese American. The reason that this is relevant is because we live in the day and age where holding the wrong opinion is increasingly frequently grounds for getting black listed or worse. They feel strongly enough that they&#x27;re willing to risk an <i>immense</i> amount, just to share their views and values.<p>They they feel so strongly about this issue is reasonable evidence that <i>many</i> others also likely feel strongly about this issue, and not necessarily in support of the protesters. Consequently, there are undoubtedly large numbers of people expressing genuine negative views against the protesters. How many of these individuals ended up getting banned? It&#x27;s twitter. A huge chunk of the userbase posts like bots. There&#x27;s not exactly a whole lot of insightful discussion going on with 140 characters + memes.

"Way back when, I used to do some volunteer work for the Better Business Bureau, which put out similar messaging in regard to everyday consumer complaints. It also was a business-funded group that, in hindsight, tried to accomplish three things:<p>1. Letting companies feel good about themselves<p>2. Providing something worthy sounding in the public eye that might defuse &quot;bad publicity.&quot;<p>3. Doing a bit of investigation and complaint resolution in connection with the scummiest 5% of businesses, which often weren&#x27;t members. Moral outrage? A desire to kneecap the most difficult competitors? Probably a bit of both.<p>I&#x27;ll agree with earlier posters who are a bit cynical about all the factors listed in Reasons 1 and 2. But Reason 3 shouldn&#x27;t be overlooked. I don&#x27;t think the Business Roundtable will suddenly be concerned about how Exxon, Walmart, etc. make their money or deal with customers, employees, suppliers, etc. On the other hand, odds are good that they will take a stand against small-time chicken processors, toxic-waste dumpers, etc.<p>Back in my BBB days, we did some real work to crack down on fraudulent apartment-referral outfits, which not only ripped off newcomers to New York City, but also made life ugly for the mainstream realtors, building owners, etc. that were BBB members.<p>Even if such battles may seem like grandstanding, they can be of some use."
